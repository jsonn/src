  them in 'all'.  (mhitch)

lib/libc/arch/mips/sys/cerror.S			1.6

  Explicilty reload the mips-ABIcall GOT/$gp in cerror().  cerror()
  gets called from outside libc (e.g., from libposix's rename(), and
  if we don't load $t9, cerror() makes wild references using the
  libposix $gp and coredumps.  (jonathan)

usr.sbin/inetd/inetd.c				1.43

  From "buqtraq": avoid file descriptor leak if service is looping.
  (tron)

  tzcode but is not compiled into our libc since it is intended for
  use with Mach only.  (kleink)

sys/dev/ic/z8530tty.c				1.49-1.50

  Initialize the struct tty's t_dev field at attach, so that the
  console parameters are correctly set even if the console is not
  zstty0.  (wrstuden)

sys/arch/amiga/amiga/locore.s			patch

  support for hash functions other than "& hashmask" (such as
  "& prime_number").  (tls)

sys/netinet/if_arp.c				1.43-1.45, 1.47-1.49, 1.52

  Change list of interface IP addresses to a hash.  Improves performance
  on hosts with a large number of IP addresses significantly.  (tls)

sys/netinet/tcp_fsm.h				1.9-1.10

  Back out the change from TCP/IP vol 2, in revision 1.7, which removed
  TH_FIN from the output flags for CLOSING state.  Fix TCPS_HAVERCVDFIN()
  to actually catch all TCP states in which a FIN has been received
  (CLOSE_WAIT, CLOSING, LAST_ACK, and TIME_WAIT).  (mycroft)

  (PR#4835).  (christos)

distrib/utils/sysinst/arch/i386/fdisk.c		patch

  Eliminates a gratious call to fdisk to initialize the mbr.
  If the mbr already contained valid code and a partition table,
  these were overridden by this fdisk call.  If the mbr wasn't
  valid yet, fdisk would initialize the code and partition table
  anyway the first time it writes anything to the disk, and fdisk
  will be called at least once in any case, to set the active
  partition.  (ws)

sys/arch/i386/i386/disksubr.c			patch
sys/arch/i386/include/disklabel.h		patch

  Recognize DOS FAT32 and Linux ext2fs partitions in the default

  new disklabel and can mount them from a disk that contains no
  NetBSD partition.  (fvdl)

usr.sbin/ypbind/ypbind.c			1.37 (patch)

  Use syslog() (with LOG_DAEMON) instead of warn()/err().  Messages
  will still be printed to stderr if ypbind is started in debug mode.
  Also, don't exist if none of the servers listed in
  /var/yp/binding/<domainname>.ypservers are reacheable.  It's a
  temporary failure that can be recovered from.  (bouyer)

  PCI devices (e.g., Buslogic BT958) will now be correctly
  configured.  (mjacob)

sys/arch/alpha/pci/sio.c			1.23

  Fix softc declaration for 'pceb' device.  The incorrect
  definition caused an obscure bug in which the configuration
  code would stop at the bridge (pceb) and would not even call
  match for the two Qlogic ISP cards that followed.  (mjacob)

  version names, csh(1)-style alternate version names, and match
  version numbers relationally.  Add support for build-version, and
  build-info files in binary packages.  Add support for detecting
  conflicting packages.  Eliminate redundant options from
  pkg_create(1).  Improve documentation.  Use NetBSD's ftp(1)
  client to retrieve binary packages by URL.  Various other bug fixes.
  (agc and feyrer)

sys/dev/pci/isp_pci.c				patch

  Jumbo patch to bring release branch up to date with current state
  of Qlogic ISP SCSI/FibreChannel HBA driver.  (Fixes PR#5197 and
  several operational problems.)  (mjacob)

gnu/usr.bin/gcc/common/expr.c			1.2

  Fixes a code generation bug in store_expr() when the rhs is a memory
  location pointed to by a postincremented (or postdecremented) pointer
  and the value of the assignment is reused (PR#6373).  (mycroft)

sys/nfs/nfs_syscalls.c				1.33

  Fixes lossage with swapping over NFS.  (mycroft)

sys/vm/vm_swap.c				1.64

  Fixes swapping over NFSv3; previously the server could throw away data
  because we did `unstable' writes and never committed them.  (mycroft)

sys/kern/vfs_cluster.c				1.19-1.21

  Fixes arithmetic overflows handling files larger than 2GB.  Fixes
  problems with clustering when the file system block size is less
  than BUFPAGES/NBUF*NBPG (PR#6332).  (It now tries more aggressively
  to use buffers that still have extra space, and it theoretically
  never frees a buffer with b_bcount>fs_bsize.)  (mycroft)

usr.bin/gprof/Makefile				patch

  Build a.out gprof on mips.  The binutils gprof doesn't support
  the mips, and a.out profiling is better than none.  (jonathan)

share/mk/bsd.prog.mk				1.97

  Explicitly add CRTBEGIN and CRTEND to the link line when building
  programs with DESTDIR set for all ELF ports (rather than just on
  alpha and powerpc; i.e., now including mips).  (jonathan)

gnu/lib/bfd/targmatch.h				patch

  Add correct mips target names.  (jonathan)

sys/arch/i386/isa/clock.c			1.47-1.50, 1.53-1.55

  Update the "something's wrong" base date from 1985 to 1995.  Add
  sanity checking to prevent problems if the date in the RTC is
  outside of the range time_t can represent.  This is a rare
  problem, but it is devastating if it happens to someone.  Fix
  assorted Y2K problems.  (perry)

sys/sys/socket.h				1.39

  Define COMPAT_OLDSOCK and MSG_COMPAT when COMPAT_ULTRIX is
  defined.  (mrg)

gnu/usr.bin/gcc/common/loop.c			1.2

  Fix cut-and-paste error.  (feyrer)

sys/dev/mii/mii.c				patch

  Add support to set buffer-size (send+receive), re-dial if the
  connection attempt failed and saving to a given filename if a
  URL is given. Also, passive mode is now tried first by default.
  Other miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.  (feyrer)

  explain more clearly what it's asking about.  (jonathan)

distrib/utils/sysinst/msg.mi.eng		1.31

  Explain that this menu lets the user choose partition-size units
  for either BSD disklabel partitions, or (on some ports) for MBR
  slices, too.  (jonathan)

distrib/utils/sysinst/msg.mi.eng		1.32

  Change `layout' message to explicitly say that here, partitions are
  being defined in the BSD disklabel (not the MBR).  (jonathan)

distrib/utils/sysinst/menus.mi.eng		1.21
distrib/utils/sysinst/menus.mi.fr		1.8

  UI safety: change order of menu entries in BSD disklabel-editing
  menu, so that the default option is to change a partition entry,
  rather than proceed.  (The change-parittion menu has an option
  to quit.)  (jonathan)

  When editing BIOS geometry, prompt user with current idea of BIOS
  geometry.  (jonathan)

distrib/utils/sysinst/net.c			1.35 (patch)

  Handle ifconfig "media: ethernet manual" output for devices with
  non-soft-settable media.  Treat that as if there was no media output.
  Use a supplied media-string of "<null>" or "<default>" or synonyms to
  avoid passing explicit media flags onto ifconfig.  (jonathan)

  Allow installation of NetBSD on the whole disk even on systems where

distrib/notes/pmax/QUICK.INSTALL		1.1-1.2 (new)

  Some quick notes on installing NetBSD/pmax, but not a replacement
  for the true "INSTALL" notes.  (simonb)

distrib/notes/pmax/install			patch

  Fix various typos.  Mention that Ultrix doesn't have Rock Ridge
  extenstions so some paths on a CD-ROM will be truncated/mangled.
  (PR#6296)  Warn that messages about "using ULTRIX label information"
  may appear when disklabeling old Ultrix disks.  (PR#6300)  Reference
  the section on dd'ing a disk image into the swap partition of an Ultrix
  disk in the "QUICK.INSTALL" notes.  (PR#6299)  Mention that it may be
  necessary to hand-mount a CD on /mnt2 before starting sysinst.
  (Partial fix for PR#6307)  Specifically mention that NetBSD/pmax uses
  rzX devices for CD-ROMs and not cdX like other NetBSD ports, and redo
  the special CD-ROM installation instructions.  Describe the process of
  updating the RTC.  (simonb)

etc/netstart					1.53

  Use 'echo' instead of 'logger,' because logger is in /usr and that will
  not be mounted on most systems by the time netstart runs.  If logger is
  used and is not present, the message explaining why the system is
  dropping back to single-user mode won't be printed.  (abs)
