lib/libc/arch/mips/sys/cerror.S			1.6

  Explicilty reload the mips-ABIcall GOT/$gp in cerror().  cerror()
  gets called from outside libc (e.g., from libposix's rename(), and
  if we don't load $t9, cerror() makes wild references using the
  libposix $gp and coredumps.  (jonathan)

  use with Mach only.  (kleink)

sys/dev/ic/z8530tty.c				1.49-1.50

  Initialize the struct tty's t_dev field at attach, so that the
  console parameters are correctly set even if the console is not

  on hosts with a large number of IP addresses significantly.  (tls)

sys/netinet/tcp_fsm.h				1.9-1.10

  Back out the change from TCP/IP vol 2, in revision 1.7, which removed

  (PR#4835).  (christos)

distrib/utils/sysinst/arch/i386/fdisk.c		patch

  Eliminates a gratious call to fdisk to initialize the mbr.
  If the mbr already contained valid code and a partition table,
  these were overridden by this fdisk call.  If the mbr wasn't
  valid yet, fdisk would initialize the code and partition table
  anyway the first time it writes anything to the disk, and fdisk
  will be called at least once in any case, to set the active
  partition.  (ws)

sys/arch/i386/i386/disksubr.c			patch
sys/arch/i386/include/disklabel.h		patch

  Recognize DOS FAT32 and Linux ext2fs partitions in the default

  new disklabel and can mount them from a disk that contains no
  NetBSD partition.  (fvdl)
