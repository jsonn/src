Changes from NetBSD 1.3.3 to NetBSD 1.3.4:

File						Version(s)
----						--------

sys/netinet/in_pcb.c				1.56

  If INADDR_ANY is given in in_pcbconnect(), choose the ia_addr of the
  first interface, not the ia_broadaddr.  (Fixes PR#5645 and PR#6425.)
  (lukem)

sys/dev/ic/ncr53c9xvar.h			1.12
sys/dev/ic/ncr53c9x.c				1.24

  Allocate SCSI message buffers in ncr53c9x_attach(), with a provision
  for front-ends to override the allocation to avoid alignment
  handling in their DMA engines.  (Fixes PR#5180.)  (pk)

usr.bin/ftp/util.c				patch

  Fix 1.3.3 ftp's filename completion (PR#6647).  (frueauf)

sys/arch/i386/i386/ibcs2_machdep.c		patch

  Compiling a kernel with COMPAT_IBCS2 and VM86 failed due to a missing
  include of <machine/vm86.h>.  Fix that.  Fixes PR#5574 and PR#5884.
  (frueauf)

sys/sys/cdio.h					1.17
sys/isofs/cd9660/cd9660_vfsops.c		1.35
sys/dev/scsipi/cd.c				1.118

  Add multisession capability.  (Fixes PR#6093.)  (is)

lib/libc/stdio/freopen.c			1.8

  When reopening in append mode, seek to the end of file in order to have
  the internally kept offset pointer reflect this; ftell(3) would report
  an incorrect current offset otherwise.  Fixes PR#6381.  (kleink)

distrib/sparc/xsets/Makefile			1.2 (deleted)

  Remove long-unused file.  (mrg)

usr.bin/login/login.1				1.14

  Correct documentation of /etc/nologin to note that it does not
  apply to the superuser (PR#6328).  Correct some nroff nits in the
  process.  (fair)
