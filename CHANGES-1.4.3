sbin/mknod/mknod.8				1.17

  In the example conf.c path, arch-specific directories now

  to the quirk table so that they don't use tagged queueing.
  Fixes problems reported in PR#7694.

distrib/notes/common/sysinst			patch

  Clarify the PCMCIA IRQ allocation workaround.  Fixes PR#9568.

sys/uvm/uvm.h					1.19
sys/uvm/uvm_page.c				1.32

  Use a more reliable method to determine if uvm_page_init() has

  (typically with lots of memory) where the kernel page table needs
  to grow during initialization.

gnu/dist/gcc/config/alpha/alpha.c		1.6

  Do not enable CIX on ev6/21264, but add an ev67/21264a switch
  that does.  Fixes kernel built with -mcpu=ev6.

  includes instructions for patching the kernel binary and for
  configuring the corresponding kernel option.

  Location, but merely a convention.

share/man/man4/options.4			1.103-1.104 via patch

  Document PCMCIA IO space conflicts and options.  Note use and
  existance of PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE and PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE.

usr.bin/man/pathnames.h				1.4

  Pull up various changes from the trunk:
   o fix signal handlers to avoid obscure exit codes
   o clean up after SIGPIPE
   o try TMPDIR env variable, fall back to _PATH_TMP
   o fall back to more if PAGER is set but null
   o recognize _crunch in man.conf
   o use uname(3) to determine MACHINE type
   o man page typos fixed.  Document _crunch.

lib/libpcap/pcap.c				1.8
lib/libpcap/savefile.c				1.6

  Fix pcap_dispatch() timeout handling.  Use snprintf, not sprintf.
  This synchronizes with a more recent LBL libpcap.

sys/arch/i386/conf/HOMEWORLD			patch

  Synchronize with config for the new HOMEWORLD machine.

share/man/man8/man8.i386/boot_console.8		1.5

  Remove text asserting that CONSDEV_AUTO and CONSDEV_COM*KBD imply
  COMCONS_KEYPRESS (they don't).

bin/dd/position.c				1.7-1.8

  Correctly lseek() on non-tape character devices (e.g. disks)
  as the manual page documents.

sys/sys/proc.h					1.88 via patch

  In skeyverify(), don't restore priority to 0, but to previous
  priority.  Fixes PR#4891.

sys/uvm/uvm_map.c				1.72

  Undo revision 1.13: don't block interrupts while deactivating
  one pmap and activating another, since these only affect user-
  level mappings which cannot be accessed from interrupt context.
  This fixes Sparc zstty overflows reported in PR#8322, since pmap
  operations are slow on old sun4c sparcs.

gnu/dist/gcc/config/alpha/netbsd.h		1.11

  Pass the appropriate directive to the assembler if an -mcpu=...
  option is given to the compiler.

sys/net/if.c					1.62 via patch

  Fix ifa_ifwithnet() for the netatalk case to properly return the
  best match and not the first match.  Makes netatalk work again
  on networks without AppleTalk routers.  Fixes PR#9957.

sys/dev/pci/if_ti.c				1.6-1.7 via patch

  Fix bug which could result in a panic.  Add a shutdown hook to
  stop the board to avoid memory corruption on reboot.  Use bus_space
  for TIGON 2 chips, so that they will work even if we can't map
  the memory space linearly (e.g. on alpha).

sys/msdosfs/fat.h				1.14

  Correct broken "LP64 fix" introduced in last pullup, and better
  explain sense of MSDOSFSEOF() macro.  Fixes PR#9116, PR#9206 and
  part of PR#8037.

  if map of SB I/O space failed.  Fixes PR#9992.

sys/netinet/ip.h				1.20-1.21

  Add "__attribute__((__packed__))" to structures used to describe
  on-the-wire data, to prevent egcs from making unwarranted assumptions
  about the alignment of these structures.

sys/kern/kern_subr.c				patch

  Allow this to compile without DIAGNOSTIC defined.

sys/ufs/lfs/lfs_vfsops.c			1.50

  Sanity check the superblock before trying to use it to find the
  alt superblock; sanity check the disk address of the alt superblock
  to avoid deadlocking when trying to read it with the primary
  superblock buffer still busy.  Fixes PR#10001.

  interface was changed.

  Correct wrong variable being tested in env parsing loop.

usr.sbin/bind/lib/Makefile			1.9 via patch
dist/bind/include/port_ipv6.h			patch (new)

  Use a static version of port_ipv6.h instead of generating it.
  The use of the probe script had at least two problems: it probed
  the host headers (could be fixed in another way), and it could
  be problematical in a cross-compile environment.

sys/netinet/ip_input.c				1.112

  Handle large offsets inside very small options correctly.

usr.sbin/wiconfig/Makefile			1.1-1.2 (new)

  Fixes PR#5279.

sys/dev/ic/elink3.c				1.80

  Make the 3Com 3C597 Fast Etherlink TX EISA card work.  Fixes PR#7067.

distrib/i386/floppies/bootfloppy-common/Makefile.inc	patch

  Make sure the PCMCIA alloc variables are retained in the symbol
  table of the resulting kernel, thereby allowing them to be tweaked
  as described in the install notes.

libexec/ftpd/ftpd.c				patch

  Back out unnecessary half of revision 1.70 which breaks parsing
  of /etc/ftpchroot.

sys/dev/microcode/isp/asm_pci.h			patch

  Correctly account for F-port vs. F-port (no FLOGI_ACC) topologies.
  Make sure we get a port database entry for the fabric name server.
  Preserve fabric logins if the device didn't change across fabric
  or port database changes, or the device has already logged into
  us (e.g., for target/initiator dual role devices like Veritas
  SANbox). Propagate class 3 service parameter changes where devices
  can change roles.

  Fix all occurrences of setting a sendmarker so that setting it
  for one bus on dual bus cards doesn't wipe a pending sendmarker
  for other busses on the same card.

  Comments added and clarifications made in some of the target mode code.

  Add support for > 12 byte CDBs.  Split out nvram reading into
  per-card functions.  Add proper Ultra2/Ultra3 support.  Upgrade
  firmware.

sys/dev/pci/if_fxp.c				patch

  Fix the fxp driver so that it works after a warm-boot from windows
  and across an APM suspend/resume or hibernate/resume cycle.  Fixes
  PR#9370, PR#9548, PR#9571 and PR#9573.

distrib/notes/common/main			patch
distrib/notes/common/sysinst			patch

  Revert 12-bit iospace for PCMCIA to 0x400-0xfff.  Mask out a
  superset of the PCMCIA IRQs from GENERIC in INSTALL (5, 7 and
  10).  Rework the text explaining the PCMCIA workarounds; explain
  both the IO space and IRQ workarounds.

sys/dev/ic/smc83c170.c				1.31 via patch

  Use the lower bits of the crc32 for the multicast address filter,
  not the upper bits.  Fixes PR#8268.
