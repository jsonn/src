share/man/man4/options.4			1.103-1.104 via patch

  Document PCMCIA IO space conflicts and options.  Note use and

share/man/man8/man8.i386/boot_console.8		1.5

  Correctly lseek() on non-tape character devices (e.g. disks)
  as the manual page documents.

  In skeyverify(), don't restore priority to 0, but to previous
  priority.  Fixes PR#4891.

sys/uvm/uvm_map.c				1.72

  Undo revision 1.13: don't block interrupts while deactivating
  one pmap and activating another, since these only affect user-
  level mappings which cannot be accessed from interrupt context.
  This fixes Sparc zstty overflows reported in PR#8322, since pmap
  operations are slow on old sun4c sparcs.

gnu/dist/gcc/config/alpha/netbsd.h		1.11

  Pass the appropriate directive to the assembler if an -mcpu=...
  option is given to the compiler.

sys/net/if.c					1.62 via patch

  Fix ifa_ifwithnet() for the netatalk case to properly return the
  best match and not the first match.  Makes netatalk work again
  on networks without AppleTalk routers.  Fixes PR#9957.

sys/dev/pci/if_ti.c				1.6-1.7 via patch

  Fix bug which could result in a panic.  Add a shutdown hook to
  stop the board to avoid memory corruption on reboot.  Use bus_space
  for TIGON 2 chips, so that they will work even if we can't map
  the memory space linearly (e.g. on alpha).

sys/msdosfs/fat.h				1.14

  Correct broken "LP64 fix" introduced in last pullup, and better
  explain sense of MSDOSFSEOF() macro.  Fixes PR#9116, PR#9206 and

  if map of SB I/O space failed.  Fixes PR#9992.

sys/netinet/ip.h				1.20-1.21

  Add "__attribute__((__packed__))" to structures used to describe
  on-the-wire data, to prevent egcs from making unwarranted assumptions
  about the alignment of these structures.  Fixes part of SA#2000-02.

sys/kern/kern_subr.c				patch

  Allow this to compile without DIAGNOSTIC defined.

sys/ufs/lfs/lfs_vfsops.c			1.50

  Sanity check the superblock before trying to use it to find the
  alt superblock; sanity check the disk address of the alt superblock
  to avoid deadlocking when trying to read it with the primary
  superblock buffer still busy.  Fixes PR#10001.

dist/bind/include/port_ipv6.h			patch (new)

  Use a static version of port_ipv6.h instead of generating it.
  The use of the probe script had at least two problems: it probed
  the host headers (could be fixed in another way), and it could
  be problematical in a cross-compile environment.

sys/netinet/ip_input.c				1.112

  Handle large offsets inside very small options correctly.
  Fixes part of SA#2000-002.

usr.sbin/wiconfig/Makefile			1.1-1.2 (new)

  with e.g. an AVM Fritz! card to work with an ep0 card in EISA slot 1.
  Fixes PR#5279.

sys/dev/ic/elink3.c				1.80

distrib/i386/floppies/bootfloppy-common/Makefile.inc	patch

  table of the resulting kernel, thereby allowing them to be tweaked
  as described in the install notes.

sys/dev/microcode/isp/asm_pci.h			patch

  Correctly account for F-port vs. F-port (no FLOGI_ACC) topologies.
  Make sure we get a port database entry for the fabric name server.
  Preserve fabric logins if the device didn't change across fabric
  or port database changes, or the device has already logged into
  us (e.g., for target/initiator dual role devices like Veritas
  SANbox). Propagate class 3 service parameter changes where devices
  can change roles.

  Fix all occurrences of setting a sendmarker so that setting it
  for one bus on dual bus cards doesn't wipe a pending sendmarker
  for other busses on the same card.

  Comments added and clarifications made in some of the target mode code.

  Add support for > 12 byte CDBs.  Split out nvram reading into
  per-card functions.  Add proper Ultra2/Ultra3 support.  Upgrade
  firmware.

sys/dev/pci/if_fxpvar.h				patch
sys/dev/pci/if_fxp.c				patch

  Fix the fxp driver so that it works after a warm-boot from windows
  and across an APM suspend/resume or hibernate/resume cycle.  Fixes

distrib/notes/common/main			patch
distrib/notes/common/sysinst			patch

  Revert 12-bit iospace for PCMCIA to 0x400-0xfff.  Mask out a
  superset of the PCMCIA IRQs from GENERIC in INSTALL (5, 7 and
  10).  Rework the text explaining the PCMCIA workarounds; explain
  both the IO space and IRQ workarounds.

sys/dev/ic/smc83c170.c				1.31 via patch

  Use the lower bits of the crc32 for the multicast address filter,
  not the upper bits.  Fixes PR#8268.

  Do not let RST TCP segments create state.

sys/dev/pci/if_fxp.c				patch

  Calibrate the timeouts by using DELAY(1) so their values are less
  machine-dependant. Fixes PR#10141, where spurious timeouts were
  being seen.  Also report the line numbers of the timeouts so it
  can be determined which is being seen.

sys/kern/sysv_sem.c				1.37

sys/arch/sun3/conf/GENERIC3X			patch

  Disable the UNION file system, to avoid a repeat of the 1.4.1
  and 1.4.2 LAST_MINUTE changes.  It is reportedly buggy, and can
  be used by ordinary users to crash the system.

distrib/notes/common/main			patch

  The version of IPF shipped with 1.4.2 was 3.3.6, not 3.3.5.
  Correct the notes correspondingly.

  the fly based on numbers supplied here.

sys/arch/sparc/conf/INSTALL			patch
distrib/sparc/ramdisk/Makefile			patch

  Use 3240 and not 3528 as miniroot size.

  Don't strip kernel, copy INSTALL kernel to kernel directory
  under ``make release''.

distrib/sparc/bootfs.sysinst/Makefile		patch

  kernel to kernel directory under ``make release''.

distrib/sparc/ramdisk/list			patch

  Make the "ramdisk" devices, not the "floppy" devices.

distrib/utils/sysinst/arch/vax/md.h		patch

usr.sbin/portmap/portmap.c			1.25
usr.sbin/portmap/portmap.8			1.11

  Fix a hole in the portmap libwrap access control. The new code
  disallows all indirect calls to the portmapper except for
  PMAPPROC_NULL unless the -i (insecure) flag has been specified.
  While there, add a new flag, -p (paranoid) which also disallows
  indirect calls to a small number of other services, including
  key parts of NFS and NIS.
