  install the formatted release notes.

sys/arch/arm32/conf/CATS			patch

  Add vr(4) and ukphy to config.

lib/libc/sys/intro.2				1.20-1.21

  Note that EFAULT can't be guaranteed in e.g. pipe(2); fixes PR#7720.
  Update the description of errno.  Fixes PR#9496.

etc/etc.i386/MAKEDEV				1.85

  Create wd2 and wd3 device nodes also on the floppy images, to allow
  installation on those drives too.

sys/dev/pci/ncr.c				1.87, 1.96-1.97

  Fix script bug in processing QUEUE FULL response (would always
  trigger an assertion failure), and add Quantum Atlas IV drives
  to the quirk table so that they don't use tagged queueing.
  Fixes problems reported in PR#7694.

distrib/notes/common/sysinst			patch

  Clarify the PCMCIA IRQ allocation workaround.  Fixes PR#9568.

usr.bin/du/du.c					1.15

sys/arch/mips/mips/pmap.c			1.88
sys/arch/pc532/pc532/pmap.new.c			patch (1.47 pmap.c)
sys/uvm/uvm.h					1.19
sys/uvm/uvm_page.c				1.32

  Use a more reliable method to determine if uvm_page_init() has
  completed.  This fixes a problem observed on some i386 configs
  (typically with lots of memory) where the kernel page table needs
  to grow during initialization.
