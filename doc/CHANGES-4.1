	Welcome to 4.0_STABLE

	Use PRIx64 for a 64-bit quantity instead of llx in a debug print.
	Add (commented-out) support for IPMI on amd64--pretty much copied straight
	from i386.
	Check for duplicate sensor names in the IPMI table.  If a duplicate name
	is found, try to make it unique by appending a count (1-99) to the sensor
	description (truncating, if necessary).
