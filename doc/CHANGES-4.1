File						Revision(s)
----						--------
gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patch
sys/sys/param.h					patch

	Welcome to 4.0_STABLE

sys/arch/amd64/amd64/bios32.c			1.6
sys/arch/amd64/amd64/mainbus.c			1.17

sys/arch/x86/x86/ipmi.c				1.8
sys/dev/DEVNAMES				1.228

	Use PRIx64 for a 64-bit quantity instead of llx in a debug print.
	Add (commented-out) support for IPMI on amd64--pretty much copied straight
	from i386.
	Check for duplicate sensor names in the IPMI table.  If a duplicate name
	is found, try to make it unique by appending a count (1-99) to the sensor
	description (truncating, if necessary).
	[briggs, ticket #989]

sys/dev/raidframe/rf_netbsdkintf.c		1.231 via patch

	Implement dumping kernel cores to RAID 1 sets.  The component used
	for the dump is selected in this order of preference:
	   1) the master
	   2) a used_spare of the master
	   3) the slave
	   4) a used_spare of the slave
