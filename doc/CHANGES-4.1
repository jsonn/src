	Upgrade bzip2 to 1.0.5, fixing CVE-2008-1372 and CVE-2005-0953
	[adrianp, ticket #1106]
sys/arch/cobalt/dev/panel.c			1.16

	Print "NetBSD/cobalt Starting up...  " to LCD panel on boot, and also
	print "NetBSD/cobalt Shutting donw..." on halt via shutdown hook.
	This would be useful for users who don't have serial console.
	[tsutsui, ticket #1103]

sys/arch/cobalt/cobalt/machdep.c		1.93 via patch

	Fix botched spl(9) bug I introduced back in 3.99.18 (rev 1.64):
	Don't enable unhandled interrupts before all interrupts are processed.
	Should fix "long download, network frozen" problems reported on
	port-cobalt by several people.
	[tsutsui, ticket #1104]

sys/dev/ic/rtl8169.c				1.94, 1.95, 1.97, 1.98
sys/dev/ic/rtl81x9reg.h				1.28

	It looks vlan tag info must appear not only in the first descriptor
	but in all descriptors of a multi-descriptor transmission attempt on
	re(4).  Problem was reported and fix was confirmed by Chris Brookes
	on tech-net.  Should also close PR#37959.
	Other various, cosmetic fixes.
	[tsutsui, ticket #1105]

sys/secmodel/overlay/secmodel_overlay.c		1.4 via patch

	Support device scope.
	[elad, ticket #1108]

sys/dev/ata/wd.c				1.359
	The Hitachi HDP725025GLA380 returns "aborted command" instead of
	"id not found" when hitting the LBA48 bug, so also install the
	LBA48 bug workaround on "aborted command" errors.
	[bouyer, ticket #1094]

share/man/man4/rum.4				1.4
	Correct firmware path in rum(4). 
	PR#38216 from Nicola Mingotti.
	[dholland, ticket #1110]

sys/dev/mii/rlphy.c				1.14-1.15
	Prepare sc_rtl8201l flag in softc and use it in rlphy_status() so that
	we don't have to check device names of device_parent(). From FreeBSD.
	PR#38234.
	[tsutsui, ticket #1111]
