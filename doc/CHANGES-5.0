gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patched by hand
sys/sys/param.h					patched by hand

	Welcome to 5.0_BETA!

sys/arch/arm/gemini/obio_wdt.c			1.2
distrib/evbarm/instkernel/instkernel/Makefile	1.14
distrib/evbarm/gzboot/gzimg/Makefile		1.20

	Register gemini watchdog with sysmon_wdog_register and rip out some
	debugging code.  Create gemini instkernel and gzimg.	
	[cliff, ticket #2]

etc/etc.cobalt/MAKEDEV.conf			1.10

	Create bpf(4) device node on ramdisk for sysinst.
	[tsutsui, ticket #4]

sys/kern/vfs_dirhash.c				1.5-1.8

	Clean up dirhash and use hash32_strn(). Remove old KASSERTS that
	were commented out. Protect the dirhash_queue when purging hashed
	directories in memory overflow situations. Clarify the dirhash
	locking protocol and remove unnessiary #ifdef DEBUG flag.
	[reinoud, ticket #5]

etc/etc.amd64/MAKEDEV.conf			1.13-1.15
etc/etc.i386/MAKEDEV.conf			1.17-1.19

	Create 4 Xen disks by default and all three Xen devices to make it
	usable out-of-the-box.  Create 8 dk instances by default, since GPT
	autodiscovery is enabled.
	[joerg, ticket #3]

sys/fs/udf/udf_strat_rmw.c			1.10

	Explicitly set buffer's block numbers. Blocks were always read/written
	correctly only the sheduling could go less than optimal.
	[reinoud, ticket #6]

external/mit/xorg/lib/Makefile			1.5

	Move libXft down in the hierarchy, because it depends on libXrandr.
	[cube, ticket #7]

sys/fs/udf/udf_strat_rmw.c			1.11

	Introduce an extra state to wich all pushed ecclines are pushed
	on.  This extra state has a holding time in wich no writeouts will
	be done effectively collecting more sectors before its even scheduled
	for writing.  Significantly boosts write performance.
	[reinoud, ticket #8]

sys/miscfs/genfs/genfs_io.c			1.14
sys/nfs/nfs_bio.c				1.180
sys/uvm/uvm_extern.h				1.149

	- allocate 8 pointers on the stack to avoid stack overflow in nfs.
	- make that 8 a constant
	- remove bogus panic
	Fixes PR kern/39777. 
	[tron, ticket #9]

dist/file/src/apprentice.c			1.20

	Fix build of file when cross-compiling on Solaris.
	[hubertf, ticket #11]

usr.sbin/mmcformat/mmcformat.8			1.2

	Fix manpage; it showed option -i where it had to be -I
	[reinoud, ticket #12]

sys/arch/atari/dev/clock.c			1.42

	Move tc_init(&clk_timecounter) to stop the "timecounter:" message
	appearing in the middle of the clock0 attach message.
	[abs, ticket #13]

sys/arch/atari/dev/md_root.c			1.26

	Use brelse() to unbusy bp buffer to allow user to swap floppy
	disks when prompted.
	[abs, ticket #14]

sys/dev/sysmon/sysmon_envsys_events.c		1.59-1.60

	Restore previous behavior concerning CRITICAL events.  Send an
	event whenever state enters or exits CRITICAL, or whenever value
	of sensor changes while the state is CRITICAL.
	[pgoyette, ticket #15]

external/mit/xorg/lib/libXaw7/Makefile		1.4

	Add necessary defines (-DXAW7).
	[cube, ticket #16]

sys/arch/x86/include/ipmivar.h			1.9
sys/arch/x86/x86/ipmi.c				1.22-1.25

	Initialize the sc_dev.dv_xname in ipmi_match, which is enough to
	make DEVNAME work. Finally this also allows the device_t/softc
	split. If ipmi failed to attach we would crash because we would
	end up using callouts while cold. If cold, wait 10 times longer,
	and if we spinout fail instead of trying to poll.
	[cegger, ticket #10]
