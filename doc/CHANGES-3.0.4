A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 3.0.3 release to the NetBSD 3.0.4
release:

File						Revision(s)
----						--------
doc/README.files				patch
gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patch
sys/sys/param.h					patch

	Welcome to NetBSD 3.0.3_PATCH.

sys/dev/ic/pcdisplay_subr.c			1.33 via patch
sys/dev/ic/vga.c				1.95 via patch
sys/dev/ic/vga_raster.c				1.29 via patch
sys/dev/isa/ega.c				1.23 via patch
sys/dev/rasops/rasops.c				1.56 via patch

	Implement bounds checking in some places in display driver code to
	avoid the possibility of a local user panic.
	[mjf, ticket #1815]

dist/bind/bin/named/client.c			1.1.1.6 via patch
dist/bind/lib/dns/dispatch.c			1.1.1.7 via patch
dist/bind/lib/dns/include/dns/dispatch.h	1.1.1.5 via patch

	Fix for a security issue in BIND 9.3.x (CVE-2007-2926):
	Query id generation was cryptographically weak.
	[adrianp, ticket #1829]

sys/sys/socketvar.h				1.97
	Fix a bug in sblock() that has existed since revision 1.1 from BSD:
	correctly return an error if M_NOWAIT is passed to sblock() and the
	operation might block.  This remarkably subtle macro bug appears to
	be responsible for quite a few undiagnosed socket buffer corruption
	and mbuf-related kernel panics.
	[christos, ticket #1808]

sbin/ping/ping.c				1.83 - 1.85

	PR/28741: Michael Santos: ping does [not] drop root privileges
	[ghen, ticket #1818]

lib/libc/gen/Makefile.inc			1.143
lib/libc/gen/cgetcap.3				1.1 - 1.3
lib/libc/gen/getcap.3				delete

	Both libcurses and libc installed a getcap(3) manpage, and both used it
	as target for a bunch of MLINKS. This had the effect that whatever came
	last in install overwrote everything from the other camp.
	Solve this by renaming the libc page -- this makes sense because no
	function is really named "getcap" here.
	[bad, ticket #1821]

sys/kern/uipc_usrreq.c				1.98

	PR kern/32842:
	do not leak file descriptors when sending a datagram with SCM_RIGHTS
	fails. Patch from Gary Thorpe, based on changes in FreeBSD and work
	from Christian Biere.
	[martin, ticket #1820]

lib/libc/hash/sha2/sha2.c			patch
sys/crypto/ripemd160/rmd160.c			patch
sys/crypto/sha2/sha2.c				patch

	Fix SIGBUS issues on strict alignment issues. Use le32dec in RMD160
	as the data pointer to RMD160_Update doesn't have to be aligned.
	In SHA256_Update and SHA512_Update, only operate directly on the passed
	in data if no left-over in the context exists and the data is correctly
	aligned. The problem was exposed by the audit-packages rewrite in C
	and reported for the libnbcompat version in PR pkg/36662.
	[joerg, ticket #1812]

	[adrianp, ticket #1826]

sys/dev/ieee1394/fwohci.c:			patch

	PR kern/36945 by Ross Philipson: Remove call to fwohci_desc_put() in
	an error path where fwohci_desc_get() has not been called yet.
	[christos, ticket #1835]

etc/defaults/security.conf			1.20
etc/security					1.104

	The location of the pkg_info binary can now be specified in
	/etc/security.conf.
	The default remains as /usr/sbin/pkg_info.  This should fix PR# 36746.
	[adrianp, ticket #1841]

sys/netinet/ip_input.c				1.253

	Fix PR kern/36800: in FAST_IPSEC, spl level may not be restored
	properly.
	[degroote, ticket #1840]
