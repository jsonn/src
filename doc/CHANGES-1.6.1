	Substantial overhaul of podule IDs.  Unlike on PCI or USB, podule IDs
	are assigned by RISCOS Ltd (and were assigned by Acorn) to be unique
	across all manufacturers.  This means that associating each one with
	a manufacturer (and checking the manufacturer when attaching) is
	bogus. Thus, we don't do that any more.

	This should have the pleasant side-effect of getting APDL IDE
	interfaces working, since they're just ICS ones with a different
	manufacturer ID.
	[chris, ticket #120]

sys/netinet/ip_output.c				1.98-1.99

	Do not consult routing table under the following condition:
	- the destination is IPv4 multicast or 255.255.255.255, and
	- outgoing interface is specified via socket option
	This simplifies operation of routed
	(no longer require 224.0.0.0/4 to be set up)

sys/arch/powerpc/mpc6xx/pmap.c			1.46

	Set SR_PRKEY for user pmaps.  For the kernel SR(s) set
	SR_SUKEY|SR_PRKEY. Note that we never use a PTE PP of 0 or 1
	(supervisor protection) so the "key" is basically unused.  However,
	use SR_PRKEY for user space is conceptionally the right thing to do.
	Currently the kernel_pmap SR(s) are ignored but that is going to be
	fixed shortly.
	[matt, ticket #372]

sys/arch/powerpc/powerpc/trap_subr.S		1.22

	Revamp how SR(s) are loaded on the user/kernel boundary. We now load
	all 16 SR registers when transitioning between kernel and user.  Also,
	don't reload the kernel SR(s) on every trap but only on traps from
	user space. Instead of loading magic SRs for the kernel, load the
	kernel SRs from the kernel_pmap_. This makes trap_subr.S completely
	ignorant of SR uses and so they can change with having to change
	trap_subr.S. Also note that since the user and kernel get complete
	SR sets, user VA space can now be increased to 4GB if desired.
	[matt, ticket #373]

sys/arch/powerpc/include/mpc6xx/vmparam.h	1.2

	* Print a message if we're in a 64-bit slot and 64-bit data is

sys/dev/pci/if_sip.c				1.59

	Load configuration data from the EEPROM on the DP83820 differently:
	rather than grovel the EEPROM directly, initiate an "EEPROM load" in
	the PCI test register, and fetch the values from the CFG register.
	[thorpej, ticket #414]

sys/dev/pci/if_sip.c				1.60

	Add a table of known-64-bit DP83820-based cards.  Use this table
	to enable 64-bit data transfers on 64-bit cards when plugged into
	a 64-bit slot.  Right know the Asante GigaNIX is listed in that
	table.

	Sigh, there is an EEPROM bit that can be used to detect 64-bit vs
	32-bit cards.  Unfortunately, at least 2 vendors of 32-bit cards
	fail to clear the "DATA64_EN" bit in the EEPROM, which causes the
	card to lose badly, because it still manages to detect that it's
	plugged into a 64-bit PCI slot.  Yay, stupid hardware vendors.

	[thorpej, ticket #673]

sys/kern/kern_malloc_debug.c			1.7

	Don't pass VM_PROT_EXEC to pmap_kenter_pa().
	[thorpej, ticket #674]

sys/uvm/uvm_km.c				1.57

	Don't pass VM_PROT_EXEC to pmap_kenter_pa().
	[thorpej, ticket #675]

share/man/man9/pmap.9				1.15

	o Document the existing requirement that machine-independent
	  code not pmap_kenter_pa() a mapping at a virtual address
	  for which a valid mapping already exists.
	o Document the new requirement that machine-idependent code
	  not pmap_kenter_pa() a mapping with VM_PROT_EXEC.
	[thorpej, ticket #676]

share/man/man9/pmap.9				1.16

	Mdoc nits in last, and bump date for last commit.

	Don't need to frob CPSR in _splraise().
	[thorpej, ticket #680]

sys/arch/arm/arm/cpufunc_asm_xscale.S		1.15

	Fix a fencepost error in the cache flush routines, caused
	by using the wrong condition on a branch.
	[thorpej, ticket #681]

sys/arch/arm/include/cpufunc.h			1.26

	Garbage-collect some unused routines.
	[thorpej, ticket #682]

sys/arch/arm/arm/cpufunc.c			1.51

	If __ARMEB__ is defined, always set CPU_CONTROL_BEND_ENABLE
	in the CPU control register.
	[thorpej, ticket #685]

sys/arch/acorn26/acorn26/machdep.c		1.3

	Disable IRQs and FIQs when rebooting.
	[bjh21, ticket #686]

sys/arch/acorn26/acorn26/stubs.c		1.2

	The only caller of fuswintr() and suswintr(), addupc_intr(),
	can handle their returning -1, so have them always do that
	rather than panicking.
	[bjh21, ticket #687]

	New and much improved version of copyin(), copyout(), and
	kcopy() which works on both 26-bit and 32-bit machines.
	[bjh21, ticket #689]

sys/arch/arm/arm/cpufunc_asm_sa1.S		1.7

	Convert bpl's to bhi's, saves looping more than needed in
	some cases.
	[thorpej, ticket #690]

crypto/dist/openssl/apps/progs.h		1.3

	More NO_xx cleanup.
	[itojun, ticket #696]

sys/net/if_ethersubr.c				1.96-1.97

	In ether_output(), don't bother calling memcpy() to plop the ethertype
	into the packet: On system with no strict alignment constraints, just
	assign the value, and on others, do an inline 2 byte copy.
	[thorpej, ticket #702]

sys/netkey/key.c				1.73

	Fixed that the incorrect time was set to sadb_comb_{hard|soft}_usetime.
	Sync w/KAME.

	[abs, ticket #971]

sys/netinet/tcp_output.c			1.85

	Never send more than half a socket buffer of data in a
	segment.  This ensures that we can always keep 2 packets
	on the wire, and we will therefore not cause any delayed
	ACKs.  Otherwise, this causes performance problems when
	using large-MTU interfaces, such as the loopback interface.
	[thorpej, ticket #707]

sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c				1.50
sys/netinet6/in6_proto.c			1.45

	Allow bind() of deprecated addresses, trusting userland
	application knows what it's doing.
	[itojun, ticket #708]

sys/lib/libkern/libkern.h			1.41

	GCC 2.95 supports __builtin_ffs(), so use it.
	[thorpej, ticket #710]

sys/dev/pci/if_sip.c				1.62

	Do not treat the ``reset complete'' interrupts as errors.
	Doing so causes us to go into a reset/interrupt/reset loop.

sys/arch/powerpc/include/ansi.h			patch

	[yamt, ticket #925]

sys/arch/sparc64/dev/pci_machdep.c		1.33

	Set the PCI latency timer for bus master devices.

	Slightly different to the patch suggested by Takeshi Nakayama in
	PR 18451 (idea from FreeBSD). 

	Additional input from Jason Thorpe: do not hard code the bus frequency,
	instead get it from OpenFirmware.
	[martin, ticket #875]

sys/arch/sparc64/sparc64/machdep.c		1.131,1.133 via patch

	Fix typo: set _asi depending on requested endianess, not _sasi (the
	streaming accessors take care of this themselfs). Fixes 32-bit
	kernels on PCI machines. Since we now use pmap_kenter_pa, which
	ignores PMAP_LITTLE, don't bother to pass that as flags. We've
	already changed the ASIs used to access the mapped pages acordingly.
