# $NetBSD: TODO.devfs,v 1.2.2.1 2008/05/01 11:22:41 mjf Exp $

High Priority:
	- finish converting drivers
	- chmod/chgrp/mv need to signal the changes to devfsd(8)
	- flesh out "matching" framework
	- is devfs_mount MPSAFE?
	- devfs_kernel_mount should be moved to a common routine that can
	  be used by devfs and the kernel mount code,
		- vfs_syscalls.c:mount_domount()
	- switch to dynamic majors

Medium Priority:
	- make devfs completely not support regular files
	- tmpfs string pools are not needed in devfs fs code, just use
	  kmem_alloc()
	- statvfs does free space management, it should be removed and
	  be made to lie and say N inodes and blocks are always free.
	- upgrade path
		* Mounting devfs -o union and reading in device files
	- mkdir /dev/pts in the devfs fs code
	- some devices need /dev/audio0 ln -s audio0 audio, how do we cater
	  for them? it probably shouldn't be in the device driver as it's
	  surely all about policy and should be in devfsd(8)

Low Priority:
	- think about using more optimized data structures for device_name.
	- in some places memory is allocatd whilst holding a lock. 
	  allocation can take quite a while if system is low on 
	  memory (ad@)
