	Welcome to 2.0_STABLE

src/sys/dev/mii/igphy.c				1.5
src/sys/dev/mii/igphyreg.h			1.2
src/sys/dev/pci/if_wmreg.h			1.12
src/sys/dev/pci/if_wm.c				1.78

	Fix major performance issues with the i82547 Gig-E chip:
	- enable the SmartSpeed work-around code for the IGP phy, with some
	  minor adjustments.
	- add some useful constants related to the Packet Buffer Allocation
	  register.
	- add the Receive and Transmit Data FIFO registers.
	- change the Tx:Rx on-chip RAM allocation ratio based on MTU.
	- On the 82547, keep track of how much of the Tx FIFO has been used.

sys/dev/pci/if_sk.c				1.11
sys/dev/pci/if_skreg.h				1.3
sys/dev/pci/if_skvar.h				1.4

	Fix Yukon ram sizing.
	Fix tx queue (slist can be corrupted when tx interrupts hit within
	tx_encap.
	Lower interrupt moderation timer to (improves performance).
	Improve chip identification. (from linux sk98lin driver).
	Keep tx queue running by kicking the tx bmu repeatedly.

	[abs, ticket #973]

sys/arch/powerpc/powerpc/trap.c			1.104

	Make sure to do setenv/unsetenv in pairs.  This prevents panics in
	DIAGNOSTIC kernel when crossing segment boundaries.

	[matt, ticket #985]

src/sys/arch/macppc/conf/INSTALL		1.78

	Now that we have ofwboot load at 0xe00000, it doesn't make sense for
	this kernel to load at 0x800000 - move back to the default and we
	have around 13 MB of space for the kernel.
