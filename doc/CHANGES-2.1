File						Revision(s)
----						--------
sys/sys/param.h                                 patch
share/tmac/doc-common                           patch
gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local               patch

	Welcome to 2.0_STABLE

sys/dev/mii/igphy.c				1.5
sys/dev/mii/igphyreg.h				1.2
sys/dev/pci/if_wmreg.h				1.12
sys/dev/pci/if_wm.c				1.78

	Fix major performance issues with the i82547 Gig-E chip:
	- enable the SmartSpeed work-around code for the IGP phy, with some
	  minor adjustments.
	- add some useful constants related to the Packet Buffer Allocation
	  register.
	- add the Receive and Transmit Data FIFO registers.
	- change the Tx:Rx on-chip RAM allocation ratio based on MTU.
	- On the 82547, keep track of how much of the Tx FIFO has been used.
	[thorpej, ticket #897]

sys/dev/pci/if_sk.c				1.11
sys/dev/pci/if_skreg.h				1.3
sys/dev/pci/if_skvar.h				1.4

	Fix Yukon ram sizing.
	Fix tx queue (slist can be corrupted when tx interrupts hit within
	tx_encap.
	Lower interrupt moderation timer to (improves performance).
	Improve chip identification. (from linux sk98lin driver).
	Keep tx queue running by kicking the tx bmu repeatedly.
	[abs, ticket #973]

sys/arch/powerpc/powerpc/trap.c			1.104

	Make sure to do setenv/unsetenv in pairs.  This prevents panics in
	DIAGNOSTIC kernel when crossing segment boundaries.
	[matt, ticket #985]

sys/arch/macppc/conf/INSTALL			1.78

	Now that we have ofwboot load at 0xe00000, it doesn't make sense for
	this kernel to load at 0x800000 - move back to the default and we
	have around 13 MB of space for the kernel.
	[wrstuden, ticket #951]

sys/arch/sparc64/sparc64/pmap.c			1.157

	Do the invalidation of the (virtually-addressed) L1 cache in
	pmap_remove_all() (ie. just before we skip the per-page cache
	invalidations while tearing down each context) instead of just
	before we recycle all the contexts in ctx_alloc().  The latter
	is not good enough since a (physically tagged) L1 cache line is
	valid for all contexts, not just the one that was used to
	instantiate it. PR#24126, PR#25669 and PR#27730.
	[martin, ticket #1013]

sys/arch/sparc64/sparc64/pmap.c			1.158

	Better return value checking for pseg_get/pseg_set. Turn Debugger()
	calls into proper panics and sprinkle some KASSERTs. PR#27288.
	[martin, ticket #1014]

lib/libc/arch/sparc64/gen/_setjmp.S		1.6

	Replace the stack unwinding by a much simpler solution taken from
	../../arch/sparc/gen/_setjmp.S rev. 1.6. This ended up to be
	~identical to the OpenBSD change triggered by the same sparc change.
	[martin, ticket #1020]

lib/libc/arch/x86_64/gen/swapcontext.S 		1.3

	Use correct stack offsets after pushing values onto it.
	PR#28486.
	[hira, ticket #1029]

sys/net/if_media.c				1.23

	Add malloc_type M_IFMEDIA and use it for both malloc'ing and free'ing 
	ifmedia_entrys to prevent panic(9) in DIAGNOSTIC kernels.
	[dyoung, ticket #1030]

sys/arch/xen/i386/locore.S			1.7

	HYPERVISOR_yield is one of the hypervisor calls that's "overloaded";
	it does different things depending what's in %ebx.

	We weren't setting %ebx here *at all*; so we did not get
	SCHEDOP_yield, which was what was wanted; so unpredictable things
	happened, notably immediate return to the NetBSD idle loop, in
	other words spinning on CPU.
	[tls, ticket #1043]

sys/arch/xen/i386/machdep.c			1.11

	Terminate the domain on RB_HALT, not just on reboot.  This avoids
	looping around a cngetc() that will never return while "halted".
	[tls, ticket #1045]

sys/arch/sh3/sh3/mmu.c				1.10
sys/arch/sh3/sh3/mmu_sh3.c			1.7
sys/arch/sh3/sh3/mmu_sh4.c			1.8

	Protect accesses to PTE/TLB registers with 
	_cpu_exception_suspend()/_cpu_exception_resume() pair. Prevents 
	spontaneous reboot under heavy load
	[tsutsui, ticket #1072]

sys/nfs/nfsnode.h				patch
sys/nfs/nfs_vnops.c				patch

	nfs_lookup: check n_nctime for positive entries as well to improve
	cache consistency.
	[yamt, ticket #1077]

sys/nfs/nfs.h					patch
sys/nfs/nfs_socket.c				patch
sys/nfs/nfs_var.h				patch
sys/nfs/nfs_vnops.c				patch
sys/nfs/nfsm_subs.h				patch

	Don't do kludge for a reply to a retransmitted request
	unless we actually retransmitted the request.
	[yamt, ticket #1078]

sys/nfs/nfs_subs.c				1.140
sys/nfs/nfsnode.h				1.53

	Invalidate cache if filesize is changed besides our activity
	because it means that were out of sync with the server.
	[yamt, ticket #1079]

sys/dev/ic/tulip.c				1.130

	Silence the 'receive process failed to idle' message on the Davicom 
	DM9102A.
	[sketch, ticket #1084]

usr.sbin/ypserv/ypinit/ypinit.sh		1.12

	Fix a bug which caused "ypinit" to die with a strange error message
	if "/var/yp/binding" does not exist.
	[tron, ticket #893]

sys/dev/pci/if_wm.c				1.79 via patch
sys/dev/pci/if_wmreg.h				1.13

	Largest Tx descriptor buffer size is actually 4K.
	[thorpej, ticket #898]

dist/ntp/ntpd/ntp_io.c				1.11
dist/ntp/ntpd/ntp_proto.c			1.4

	Fix core dump problem if local system and ntp server do
	not have overlapping protocol family support (IPv4 vs.
	IPv6).  Instead, report server as unreachable, and ignore
	entry.  Fixes PR#27137.
	[christos, ticket #901]

sys/kern/sysv_sem.c				1.55

	Update sem_otime on successful call to semop().
	Fixes long-standing bug in the SYSV semaphore code which
	causes an example in Stevens' UNPv2 to fail when trying
	to compensate for a race condition in a file locking
	implementation.
	[briggs, ticket #903]

x11/Xserver/Makefile				1.13
x11/Xserver/Makefile.common			1.19
x11/Xserver/miext/Makefile			1.2
x11/Xserver/miext/shadow/Makefile		1.3

distrib/sets/lists/xserver/md.macppc		1.17
distrib/sets/lists/xserver/md.sgimips		1.7

	Build and install libshadow.a and liblayer.a.
	Fixes PR#27156.
	[rtr, tickets 905, 906, 907]

etc/rc.d/syslogd				1.15

	Use "load_rc_config `basename chrootdirscript`" in a subshell
	to determine the rc.conf(5) setting for chrootdirscript, incase
	the configuration for that is in /etc/rc.conf.d/chrootdirscript.
	Fixes PR#26478.
	[lukem, ticket #912]

usr.bin/passwd/krb5_passwd.c			1.12

	Switch to krb5_set_password that can handle the RFC3244 (as
	well as the older change password protocol).  Should enable
	changing password in a Windows2000 (or later) domain.
	[lha, ticket #917]

sys/arch/sparc64/dev/auxio.c			1.13

	In auxio_blink(), only toggle the AUXIO_LED_LED bit, don't
	clear the others.  It looks like bit 3 control the on-board
	le's link test, clearing it breaks the interface (no link
	detected on the remote end). Bit 3 is defined as AUXIO4M_LTE
	(link-test enable) for sun4m systems (maybe all the AUXIO4M_*
	bits are valid on the Ultra/1 too?).
	Tested on Ultra/1 and Ultra/5.  Fixes PR#25039.
	[bouyer, ticket #924]

lib/libc/citrus/citrus_mmap.c			1.2

	Correct check for mmap return value.  Also clean up
	the error path, convert to KNF, and use the proper stat
	macro.  Fixes PR#27283.
	[christos, ticket #931]

sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_vnops.c			1.45

	Import a change from FreeBSD: use DENYNONE to give unixy
	semantics of permitting everything not forbidden by
	permissions.  I.e. denial is up to the server with
	clients/openers needing to use advisory locks for further
	control.  Fixes file access problem when the file is already
	open on the server.

	When adding or deleting multicast addresses, only change
	the address filter if the interface is marked RUNNING.
	Fixes PR#27678.
	[thorpej, ticket #939]

sys/dev/ic/tulip.c				1.129

	When adding or deleting multicast addresses, only change
	the address filter if the interface is marked RUNNING.
	Fixes PR#27678.
	[thorpej, ticket #940]

sys/dve/isa/if_iy.c				1.65

	When adding or deleting multicast addresses, only change
	the address filter if the interface is marked RUNNING.
	Fixes PR#27678.
	[thorpej, ticket #941]

sys/dev/qbus/if_qt.c				1.5

	In qtinit(), don't skip initialization if the interface is
	already RUNNING.  ether_ioctl() will call (*if_init)() when
	flags change.  Instead, do what other drivers do, and stop
	the interface in this case before re-initializing.
	In qtioctl(), now that qtinit() does the right thing, remove
	the check for the IFF_PROMISC change.
	When adding or deleting multicast addresses, only change
	the address filter if the interface is marked RUNNING.
	Fixes PR#27678.
	[thorpej, ticket #942]

sys/dev/ic/i82596.c				1.4

	Make iee_ioctl() look more like other drivers, and fix a
	missing splx(s) as a side-effect.  Don't bother handling
	IFF_PROMISC here, because ether_ioctl() already calls
	(*if_init)() to handle flag changes.
	When adding or deleting multicast addresses, only change
	the address filter if the interface is marked RUNNING.
	Fixes PR#27678.
	[thorpej, ticket #943]

sys/dev/pci/auvia.c				1.43
sys/dev/pci/auviavar.h				1.6

	Add support for suspending/resuming.  Fixes PR#26432.
	[kent, ticket #949]

bin/pax/options.c				1.82

	Fix broken cpio(1) option handling:
	 o "cpio -i -t" should list the contents of a file, not
	   extract it.
	 o Don't extract a file when only option "-d" is given.
	Fixes PR#26513.
	[tron, ticket #952]

sys/netinet6/ipsec.c				1.98-1.99

	Add a missing break.
	[itojun, ticket #954]

usr.sbin/syslogd/syslogd.c			1.68

	Postpone initial setting of the alarm timer until after
	the call to daemon(), as the timer would be cleared by
	deamon's fork().  Fixes PR#19558.
	[heas, ticket #958]

sys/dev/pci/cs4281.c				1.21

	Make recording of clct(4) work, namely:
	 o cs_4281_intr: advance a pointer after copying data
	 o cs_4281_trigger_input: fix an inverted condition about
	   dma mode
	[yamt, ticket #967]

sys/nfs/nfs_bio.c				1.122
sys/nfs/nfs_subs.c				1.138
sys/nfs/nfsnode.h				1.50

	Since daddr_t is 64-bit these days, simply use nfs directory
	cookies as buffer cache indexes.  This should make the
	regress/sys/fs/getdents test work.  Fixes PR#27112.

	On an idea from Thor (tls@), do not fail a component if doing so would
	render the RAID set completely dead.  Instead, we retry the IO a
	maximum of RF_RETRY_THRESHOLD times (currently '5'), and then just
	return an IO error if the IO fails.  This should reduce the damage

	Various minor LFS improvements.

	Kernel:

	* Note when lfs_putpages(9) thinks it is not going to be writing any
	  pages before calling genfs_putpages(9).  This prevents a situation in
	  which blocks can be queued for writing without a segment header.
	* Correct computation of NRESERVE(), though it is still a gross
	  overestimate in most cases.  Note that if NRESERVE() is too high, it
	  may be impossible to create files on the filesystem.  We catch this
	  case on filesystem mount and refuse to mount r/w.
	* Allow filesystems to be mounted whose block size is == MAXBSIZE.
	* Somewhere along the line, ufs_bmaparray(9) started mangling UNWRITTEN
	  entries in indirect blocks again, triggering a failed assertion "daddr	  <= LFS_MAX_DADDR".  Explicitly convert to and from int32_t to correct
	  this.  Should fix PR #29045.
	* Add a high-water mark for the number of dirty pages any given LFS can
	  hold before triggering a flush.  This is settable by sysctl, but off
	  (zero) by default.
	* Be more careful about the MAX_BYTES and MAX_BUFS computations so we
	  shouldn't see "please increase to at least zero" messages.
	* Note that VBLK and VCHR vnodes can have nonzero values in di_db[0]
	  even though their v_size == 0.  Don't panic when we see this.
	  Fixes PR #26680.
	* Change lfs_bfree to a signed quantity.  The manner in which it is
	  processed before being passed to the cleaner means that sometimes it
	  may drop below zero, and the cleaner must be aware of this.
	* Never report bfree < 0 (or higher than lfs_dsize) through
	  lfs_statfs(9).  This prevents df(1) from ever telling us that our full
	  filesystems have 16TB free.
	* Account space allocated through lfs_balloc(9) that does not have
	  associated buffer headers, so that the pagedaemon doesn't run us out
	  of segments.
	* Return ENOSPC from lfs_balloc(9) when bfree drops to zero.
	* Address a deadlock in lfs_bmapv/lfs_markv when the filesystem is being
	  unmounted.  Because vfs_busy() is a shared lock, and
	  lfs_bmapv/lfs_markv mark the filesystem vfs_busy(), the cleaner can be
	  holding the lock that umount() is blocking on, then try to vfs_busy()
	  again in getnewvnode().

	cleaner:

	* Adapt lfs_cleanerd to use the fcntl call to get the Ifile filehandle,
	  so it need not be in the namespace.
	* Make lfs_cleanerd be more careful when there are very few available
	  segments.
	* Make lfs_cleanerd less verbose when the filesystem is unmounted.

	newfs_lfs, fsck_lfs, and regression:

	* Extend the lfs library from fsck_lfs(8) so that it can be used with a
	  not-yet-existent LFS.  Make newfs_lfs(8) use this library, so it can
	  create LFSs whose Ifile is larger than one segment.
	  Addresses PR #11110.
	* Make newfs_lfs(8) use strsuftoi64() for its arguments, a la newfs(8).
	* Make fsck_lfs(8) respect the "file system is clean" flag.
	* Don't let fsck_lfs(8) think it has dirty blocks when invoked with the
	  -n flag.
	* Remove the Ifile from the filesystem namespace.  The cleaner now uses
	  a fcntl call on the root inode to find the Ifile filehandle.  (As a
	  side-effect, addresses PR #29144.)

sys/dev/ata/ata_wdc.c				1.82
sys/dev/pci/geodeide.c				1.10
sys/dev/scsipi/atapi_wdc.c			1.95

	When starting an ATA or ATAPI transfer, handle the case where  
	(*dma_init)() returns EINVAL, indicating that DMA cannot be
	done for this transfer.  Fall back to PIO in this case.
	Add a geodeide_dma_init() routine that checks to make sure that  
	transfers start on a 16 byte boundary, returning EINVAL if not.
	Works around a chip bug that causes a hard system hang.
	Problem reported and patch tested by Erik Fair.

	[briggs, ticket #1238]

sys/arch/alpha/alpha/pmap.c			1.211

	1. Disable the lazy allocation of lev1map in pmap_enter(), instead
	   doing it in pmap_create(), and freeing the lev1map in
	   pmap_destroy(). This means that pm_lev1map is consistent for the
	   life of the pmap.
	2. pmap_extract() now uses vtophys() for the kernel pmap. This avoids
	   having to lock the kernel pmap, since kernel PT pages are never
	   freed.
	3. Because of (1), pmap_asn_alloc() no longer needs to operate on a
	   locked pmap; pm_lev1map will never change over the life of the pmap,
	   and all other access to the pmap is done in per-CPU fields or with
	   atomic operations.
	4. Because of (3), pmap_activate() no longer needs to lock the pmap
	   to do its work, thus eliminating the deadlock with sched_lock
	   described in PR port-alpha/25599.  This is safe because we are
	   guaranteed that the pmap is still alive, since by definition an LWP
	   that uses that it is about to run.

sys/dev/ic/wdc.c				1.226,1.229 via patch

	The ATA/ATAPI IDENTIFY data were designed to be converted on the fly to
	host byte order (eventually the byte swapping could be wired in
	hardware, on the 16 bit data bus). This was kept when
	wdc_exec_command() was created, and as a result wdc_exec_command()
	is doing 16bit conversion to host byte order. This is fine for
	IDENTIFY but doesn't work for other opaque data structure, such
	as the ones for SMART.  So change wdc_exec_command() to
	do the conversion to host byte order only for WDCC_IDENTIFY
	and ATAPI_IDENTIFY_DEVICE. This fixes atactl smart status
	on big-endian hosts.
