doc/HACKS					1.123 via patch
sys/arch/sparc64/conf/Makefile.sparc64		1.71 via patch
sys/arch/sparc64/conf/files.sparc64		1.138 via patch
sys/arch/sparc64/sparc64/locore.s		1.340 via patch

	Fix the root cause of the hack "disable optimizations for uvm_bio.c
	on 32 bit kernels".

	gcc converts a division in the calculation of UBC_UMAP_ADDR macro
	to multiplication (smul or combination of add/sll), and the
	register of its result contains a garbage in upper 32 bits (the
	upper 32 bits of smul/add/sll's result isn't zero cleared).

	Then it passes to pseg_get{,_real} through pmap_extract without the
	zero clear of upper 32 bits in the optimization case.  So the
	result of pseg_get and pmap_extact sometimes gets screwed up.
	[nakayama, ticket #1736]

sys/kern/kern_sig.c				1.300

	kpsignal2: do not make the signal pending twice when tracing the
	process, also update a comment and add an assert.
	Fixes PR/42309 by Nicolas Joly.
	[christos, ticket #1741]

usr.bin/ktruss/makeerrnos.sh			1.6

	Use 'sort -n -k 3' instead of 'sort -n +2' since the former is more
	portable.  The latter is not supported by Mac OS X Lion.
	[dyoung, ticket #1742]

	Clarify UFS2 superblock format stuff. Bump date.  Fix PR 45166.
