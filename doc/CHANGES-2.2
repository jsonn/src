	Welcome to 2.1_STABLE

doc/LAST_MINUTE					patch

	Null out in preparation for 2.2

gnu/libexec/uucp/doc/uucp.texi			1.6
gnu/libexec/uucp/libunix/pipe.c			1.3

	Allow for \H -> "address ..." substitution in PIPE ports. Useful
	e.g. for generic UUCP over SSH or SSL... Idea and part of the patch
	by Joerg Durchain, has apparently been integrated in Debian for a
	while.
	[is, ticket #5825]

sys/dev/raidframe/rf_dagdegwr.c			1.26

	Remove an RF_ASSERT that is just plain wrong.
	[oster, ticket #5878]

doc/README.files				patch

	[christos, ticket #5863]

sys/arch/alpha/conf/GENERIC			1.276

	If we're enabling ipfilter then we should really have IPFILTER_LOG
	[abs, ticket #5893]

sys/dev/ic/wdc.c				patch

	In __wdccommand_start(), don't cann wdcwait() with ata_c->flags, as 
	this gives  information about the context in which wdc_exec_command() 
	was called, but we may be in interrupt context here. Call wdcwait() 
	with flags derived from xfer->c_flags instead, as do other wdcwait() 
	callers. PR#31083
	[bouyer, ticket #5852]

include/sched.h					1.8
lib/libpthread/sched.c				1.4

	Change the sched_*() functions to return -1 and set errno to ENOSYS
	(per the standard) instead of returning ENOSYS. PR#30970
	[kleink, ticket #5918]
