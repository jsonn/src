	Welcome to 5.2_STABLE.
	[riz]

sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_node.c			1.48, 1.49 via patch
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_node.h			1.13 via patch
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_vnops.c			1.83, 1.84 via patch

	Various fixes for smbfs:

	- Implement NGONE to fix caching issue described in PR kern/25070.
	  Mostly taken from FreeBSD r125637.
	- Revert revision 1.70 of smbfs_vnops.c to fix setattr to opened
	  direcotry.  In case of SMB_CAP_NT_SMBS, NOPEN is set after
	  smbfs_smb_ntcreatex() call.  If NOPEN is set in front, it will
	  immediately return by condition at do_open label.
	- In smbfs_close(), call smbfs_smb_close() and drop NOPEN bit in
	  the case of direcotry.  Otherwise smbfs_rmdir() fails when the
	  directory was opened.
	- Remove redundant vput() before vgone().
	- Avoid unnecessary mutex_exit() in smbfs_node_alloc().
	- Set NGONE bit to from-name vnode to invalidate the smbnode cache.
	[nakayama, ticket #1823]

sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_smb.c			1.44
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_subr.c			1.16
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_subr.h			1.21
sys/fs/smbfs/smbfs_vnops.c			1.85
sys/netsmb/smb.h				1.20

	Improve smbfs timestamp handling.
	Don't round timestamp to 2 seconds resolution if the server
	supports the CAP_INFOLEVEL_PASSTHRU capability.
	[nakayama, ticket #1824]

sys/netsmb/smb_iod.c				1.31 - 1.35
sys/netsmb/smb_rq.c				1.32

	Do not call callout_stop() unless the structure was previoulsy
	initialised for a non null timeout.
	Do initialise the callout when fetching a new request structure from
	the pool, not when starting the timer. Likewise, destroy the callout
	when giving back the item to the pool.
	Send data for as long as there is new data available.  Otherwise
	there was a danger of smb_iod_recvall() blocking, hence releasing
	the kernel lock, new data creeping into the queue, and a wakeup
	being missed (well, there's still a race, but since it's theoretical
	enough for me to never have encountered it, I'll rather solve it
	by periodic wakeups).
	defensive programming: wake up iod thread once a second "just in case"
	add comment to previous stating periodic wakeups can be nuked
	once smb is mpsafe.
	[nakayama, ticket #1825]

	Fix off by one read error.
	[msaitoh, ticket #1830]

sys/external/bsd/drm/dist/shared-core/i915_suspend.c 1.6

	Fix wrong reference to dev_priv->saveSWF1. It was clearly wrong.
	[msaitoh, ticket #1831]

sbin/sysctl/sysctl.c				1.149 via patch

	Add missing free() in error path.
	[msaitoh, ticket #1832]

gnu/dist/grep/src/dfa.c				1.3
gnu/dist/grep/src/grep.c			1.14
gnu/dist/grep/src/search.c			1.4

	Change several int variables to size_t, ssize_t, or ptrdiff_t.
	This should fix the bug described in CVE-2012-5667 when an input
	line is so long that its length cannot be stored in an int
	variable.

	[apb, ticket #1838]

lib/librefuse/refuse.c				1.96 via patch

	FUSE seems to allow short writes without errors but PUFFS doesn't. Work
	around this by returning ENOSPC in case of a short write to avoid
	protocol errors. This change is based on problem analysis provided by
	Antti Kantee.
	This fixes PR lib/45129 by myself.
	[tron, ticket #1836]

sys/dev/bluetooth/bthidev.c			1.23, 1.24 via patch
sys/dev/bluetooth/btmagic.c			1.4, 1.5 via patch
usr.sbin/btdevctl/btdevctl.8			1.8 via patch

	when no link-mode is specified, explicitly set a mode of (int)0
	otherwise l2cap_setmode() will fail during connection setup
	for bthidev.c, this fixes a problem with Microsoft Wedge Touch
	mouse (which may not be able to authenticate)
	for btmagic.c, include this fix in case somebody tries that
	related to PR/47286
	[plunky, ticket #1835]

share/man/man4/wm.4			1.21-1.24 via patch

	Apply almost all fixes and improvements from netbsd-6 except for
	the rev. 1.196's iqdrops' change.

	- Add the detach code.
	- Add code for WOL, ASF, IPMI and Intel AMT. WOL is disabled by default
	- Add Yet another workaround for ICH8.
	- 82576 is dual port, so check the FUNCID and increment the
	  MAC address for the 2nd port.
	- Fix the names of 82577L[MC] LAN controllers (for mobile).
	- Fix CTRL_EXT_SWDPIN() and CTRL_EXT_SWDPIO() macros. The bit order
	  of the SW definable pin is not 6543 but 3654!!!
	- Rewrite the code to read MAC address from eeprom.
	- Add 82580 support.
	- 82571 quirk. Only 82571 shares port 0 of EEMNGCTL_CFGDONE.
	- The document says that the TDH register must be set after
	  TCL.EN is set on 82575 and newer devices.
	- Fix some register names. No functional change.
	- Omit U+00AE "REGISTERED SIGN" in a product name due to its
	  non-ASCII nature.
	- Stop wm(4) from needlessly resetting when you add or delete a vlan(4).
	- Fix MAC address check on 8257[156] and 80003 case. Some cards have
	  non 0xffff pointer but those don't use alternative MAC address
	  in reality. So we check whether the broadcast bit is set or not
	  like Intel's e1000 driver.
	  Fixes PR kern/44072 reported by Jean-Yves Moulin.
	- Add PCH2(and 82579) support. Fixes PR#46487
	- Add yet another 82567V support.
	- Add ICH10+HANKSVILL support.
	- Add support Intel I350 Ethernet.
	- Make vlan and all ip/ip6 checksum offload work for the I350.
	- Fix compile error with  WM_DEBUG.
	- Fix a bug that PHY isn't set to low-power mode on PCH and PCH2.
	- Add WM_DEBUG_NVM. If WM_DEBUG_NVM is enabled, dump the FLASH ROM data.
	- Skip 64bit BAR correctly.
	- Fix RAL_TABSIZE for ICH8, 82576, 82580 and I350.
	- Use 82580(and I350) specific PHY read/write functions. Fixes PR#47542.
	- Style fix. Fix typo in comment. Fix comments. Add comments.
	[msaitoh, ticket #1850]

sys/kern/kern_drvctl.c				1.34

	wm_valid_nvm_bank_detect_ich8lan() misunderstood the NVM's bank
	number. Fixes PR#47878.
	Fix a bug that the check of reset complete fails on Intel 8 series
	with "wm_lan_init_done: lan_init_done failed to complete" message.
	The broken code was used for ICH8, 9... and PCH2.
	The wm_linkintr_gmii() function is called from interrupt. That's
	not tick, so call mii_pollstat() instead of mii_tick().
	Add ECC support for the packet buffer. Only 82571 and I21[78] support
	ECC.
	Fix a bug that wrong semaphore is used in wm_gmii_hv_{read,write}reg.
	Add comments, fix some comments, use macros and remove trailing
	whitespaces.

	Import tzdata2013d from
	    ftp://ftp.iana.org/tz/releases/tzdata2013d.tar.gz
	Summary of changes from tzdata2013c to tzdata2013d:
	   Changes affecting current and future time stamps:
	     Morocco's midsummer transitions this year are July 7 and August 10,
	     not July 9 and August 8.  (Thanks to Andrew Paprocki.)

	     Israel now falls back on the last Sunday of October.
	     (Thanks to Ephraim Silverberg.)

	   Changes affecting past time stamps:
	     Specify Jerusalem's location more precisely; this changes the
	     pre-1880 times by 2 s.

	   Changing affecting metadata only:
	     Fix typos in the entries for country codes BQ and SX.

	   Changes affecting documentation and commentary:
	     Deemphasize the significance of national borders.

	     Update the zdump man page.

	     Remove obsolete NOID comment (thanks to Denis Excoffier).

	     Update several URLs and comments in the web pages.

	     Spelling fixes (thanks to Kevin Lyda and Jonathan Leffler).

	     Update URL for CLDR Zone->Tzid table (thanks to Yoshito Umaoka).
	[apb, ticket #1870]

sys/arch/i386/stand/boot/boot2.c		1.59 via patch

	Two changes for the i386 boot loader related to the boot menu which
	can be defined in boot.cfg:

	 * Add a "menu" command which re-displays the menu and initiates
	   the timed countdown
	 * Use any default command defined in boot.cfg as default args

	OpenSSL security fixes derived from the diff between
	OpenSSL 1.0.0n and 1.0.0o, fixing CVE-2014-3567, CVE-2014-3568,
	and adding POODLE mitigation via support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV.
	[spz, ticket #1927]
	
sys/compat/freebsd/freebsd_sysctl.c		1.17

	Do not access a userland pointer from kernel space directly, use
	copyin() instead, avoiding a crash.
	[maxv, ticket #1926]

usr.bin/ftp/fetch.c				1.206 via patch

	Don't pay attention to special characters if they don't come
	from the command line.
	[jmcneill, ticket #1928]

usr.bin/ftp/version.h				1.85

	Change the version that ftp announces to 20141026. It can be a
	useful method to determine if CVE-2014-8517 is fixed.
	[lukem, ticket #1929]

usr.sbin/ypbind/ypbind.8			1.19-1.20
usr.sbin/ypbind/ypbind.c			1.63-1.98

	State handling fixes and cleanups in ypbind; it no longer churns the
	disk, spams syslogd when the server goes down, or gets confused about
	its binding state. Fixes PR#15355, PR#32519 and also PR#43900.
