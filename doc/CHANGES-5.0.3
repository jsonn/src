external/bsd/pkg_install/dist/x509/pkgsrc.sh		patch

	Update pkg_install to 20100204.

	pkg_install-20091115:
	Completely ignore @src in pkg_create. Silently ignore the -L option.
	The combination of -I and -p are used by pkgsrc for the same result.

	Do not overwrite a string with itself using snprintf. This breaks
	setting the pkgdb directory internally on Linux. Explicitly check
	if the string is the same and otherwise just use xstrdup.

	Add support to query arbitrary variables with pkg_admin config-var.

	pkg_install-20100130:
	- pkg_add -U to rplace an installed version
	- refactored man pages
	- PKG_DBDIR / PKG_REFCOUNT_DBDIR as pkg_install.conf options
	- synced license list
	- use connection cache from libfetch

	pkg_install 20100204:
	- Restore PKG_PREFIX in pkg_delete (PR 42731)                  
	- Ensure that the current pkg_install version is at least as new   
	  as the version used to build the package

sys/arch/i386/i386/ibcs2_machdep.c		1.40
sys/arch/i386/i386/svr4_machdep.c		1.96

	fix confused CS selector, fixes the panic reported by Mark Davis
	per PR port-i386/42787 (the panic happens due to a GPF when a
	privileged descriptor is tried to be loaded with the UPL bit set)
	The original bug is very old (pre-2.0, i386/svr4_machdep.c rev. 1.69),
	but it was relatively harmless until the order of GDT entries was
	shuffled (pre-5.0, i386/segments.h rev. 1.42). Before, it caused
	a userlevel data selector to be used for CS which broke the emulation
	(likely the reason of PR port-i386/32424). The shuffle made that
	a privileged selector was used, causing the GPF.
	(recent -current doesn't panic on that GPF which seems to be a
	side effect of another change)
	[drochner, ticket #1307]

tools/compat/getmode.c				1.8

	include unistd.h where getmode is traditionally declared.
	Fix build on OS X 10.6.
	[snj, ticket #1308]

sys/arch/hppa/hppa/vm_machdep.c 		patch

	Fix ticket #793: s/setfunc_trampoline/lwp_trampoline/.
	[skrll, ticket #1312]

crypto/dist/openssl/crypto/evp/m_sha1.c		patch

	Ensure that SHA384 always calls the SHA384 functions.
	Should fix PR#42881.
	[joerg, ticket #1320]

crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_pkt.c		patch

	Apply patchset 19476 from openssl repository, fixing CVE-2010-0740.
	From http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20100324.txt:
	"In TLS connections, certain incorrectly formatted records can cause
	an OpenSSL client or server to crash due to a read attempt at NULL".
	[bouyer, ticket #1355]

sys/kern/uipc_syscalls.c			patch

	In do_sys_recvmsg(), call free(9) with the same type malloc(9) used.
	[jakllsch, ticket #1352]

crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_enc.c		1.2 via patch
crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/s3_srvr.c		1.5 via patch
crypto/dist/openssl/ssl/t1_enc.c		1.2 via patch

	Fix crash in openssl: handshake_dgst[] may be used without being
	allocated, causing NULL pointer dereference.
	Fix by checking that handshake_dgst is not NULL before use.
	[bouyer, ticket #1365]

libexec/ftpd/popen.c				1.37
libexec/ftpd/version.h				1.74

	PR/43023: FTPD bug remote crash.  Since we specify NOCHECK, in the
	NOMATCH case gl_pathv can be NULL.
	Update version to 20100320.
	[lukem, ticket #1372]

external/bsd/openldap/dist/libraries/libldap/tls.c patch

	Fix CVE-2009-3767.
	[lukem, ticket #1374]

sys/arch/amd64/amd64/locore.S			1.56

	When kernel remaps to high memory in amd64 locore, the GDT used
	before becomes invalid. As such, split it in two parts, one for
	use when system boots in low memory, and one for use when it jumps
	to high memory.
	[jym, ticket #1376]

sys/arch/x86/x86/identcpu.c			1.19

	Fix a test semantic in cpu_probe(): check that the CPU currently
	probed is the first one booting by comparing its struct cpu_info
	address with cpu_info_primary, rather than supposing that
	cpu_feature variables are set to 0.
	[jym, ticket #1377]
