sys/sys/systm.h					1.179

	Implement expansion of special "magic" strings in symlinks into
	system-specific values.  Submitted by Chris Demetriou in Nov 1995 (!)
	in PR kern/1781, modified only slighly by me.
	This is enabled on a per-mount basis with the MNT_MAGICLINKS mount
	flag.  It can be enabled at mountroot() time by building the kernel
	with the ROOTFS_MAGICLINKS option.
	[thorpej, ticket #490]

sys/kern/vfs_lookup.c				1.63

	A few tweaks to magic symlinks:
	- Add a @{var} syntax in addition to @var.  This allows for  
	patterns like
	@{ostype}-@{osrelease}-@{machine_arch}.
	- Add a @emul variable that expands to the process's emulation name
	(e.g. "netbsd", "netbsd32", "linux", etc.)
	[thorpej, ticket #559]

share/man/man7/symlink.7			1.9

	Document the new @emul magic symlink var as well as the new @{var}  
	syntax.
	[thorpej, ticket #560]
