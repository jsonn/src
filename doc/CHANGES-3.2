	[nakayama, ticket #1517]

usr.sbin/installboot/ffs.c			1.19-1.21
usr.sbin/installboot/fstypes.c			1.9
usr.sbin/installboot/installboot.8		1.54 via patch
usr.sbin/installboot/installboot.h		1.31

	Make installation of bootloaders on a RAID 1 volume easier.
	[bad, ticket #1524]

share/man/man8/man8.sparc/boot.8		1.29-1.30 + patch
sys/arch/sparc/stand/common/promdev.c		1.19

	Add support for booting from RAID 1 to the sparc boot loader.
	[jdc, ticket #1527]

etc/MAKEDEV.tmpl				1.66 (via patch)
sys/compat/freebsd/freebsd_sysctl.c		1.5 (via patch)
sys/conf/majors					1.30 (via patch)
sys/dev/pci/twa.c				1.13 (via patch)
sys/dev/pci/twaio.h				1.4 (via patch)
sys/dev/pci/twareg.h				1.6 (via patch)

	Tweak the twa(4) driver so that 3ware command line utility works with
	it.
	This includes:
	- fixing various structure definitions so that the ioctl parameter
	  match
	- adding a hw.twa*.driver_version sysctl
	- do not refuse multiple device openings, as the management tool will
	  do it.  I'm not sure we are safe. FreeBSD allows multiple openings,
	  and use the open flag only when an attempt to detach the device is
	  done.
	- While we are there, fix a bug in FreeBSD sysctl emulation: use copyin
	  for moving data to the kernel

	[manu, ticket #1528]

sys/arch/i386/conf/INSTALL			1.273
sys/arch/i386/conf/INSTALL.local		1.1
sys/arch/i386/conf/INSTALL_LAPTOP		1.92
sys/arch/i386/conf/INSTALL_SMALL		1.120
sys/arch/i386/conf/INSTALL_TINY			1.97
sys/arch/i386/conf/INSTALL_XEN2_DOMU		patch
sys/arch/i386/conf/INSTALL_XEN3_DOMU		patch

	Add (empty) INSTALL.local, parallel to GENERIC.local.
	Change INSTALL kernels to include INSTALL.local instead of
	GENERIC.local.

	With this change, one can add IPSEC in GENERIC.local and still build a
	release, rather than having install kernels not fit on floppies.

	Remaining nit: the PS2 install kernel includes the regular version
	config file, and hence GENERIC.local.

	(Posted for review on tech-pkg, encouragement to commit by lukem@, no
	objections.)
	[bad, ticket #1579]
