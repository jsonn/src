#	$NetBSD: CHANGES-3.0,v 1.1.2.29 2005/04/04 18:27:25 tron Exp $

A complete list of changes from the initial NetBSD 3.0 branch on 16 March 2005
until the 3.0 release:

doc/LAST_MINUTE					patched by hand

	Null out in preparation for 3.0

gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patched by hand
sys/sys/param.h					patched by hand

	Update to 3.0_BETA

doc/BRANCHES					1.37

	Close out 1.5 and note differences between netbsd-2 and netbsd-2-0
	branches.
	[jmc, ticket #7]

usr.sbin/pkg_install/lib/ftpio.c		1.67

	Address PR pkg/24744 by Jarmo Jaakkola <jarmo.jaakkola@iki.fi>:
	  * ftp.fi.netbsd.org returns "257" in return to a "cd" command, accept
	    that (in addition to 250 and 550). Seems to be allowed per RFC 959.
	  * Make buffer for reply bigger (not too big, as it may hit
	    performance).
	[hubertf, ticket #8]

usr.sbin/pkg_install/lib/version.h		1.65

	Bump PKGTOOLS_VERSION to today's date to allow telling in which version
	PR 24744 was fixed (affects lib/ftpio.c).
	[hubertf, ticket #9]

sbin/mount/mount.c				1.77

	Fix core dump when doing
		mount fileserver:/somepath
	by not passing a NULL pointer to getfsfile(3).
	(Bug was introduced in rev 1.74 as part of fix for PR 28644.)
	[lukem, ticket #10]

sbin/sysctl/sysctl.c				1.98

	Use regexes instead of static lists of annoying numbers to recognize
	sysctl nodes that have "helpers". This is more concise, imho more
	easy to understand, and has the added bonus of making it *possible* to
	assign helpers to dynamically numbered nodes.
	[atatat, ticket #11]

sys/sys/select.h				1.23

	Make sure to declare functions with C linkage; should fix PR bin/29730
	from Juergen Hannken-Illjes.
	[kleink, ticket #14]

doc/3DPARTY					1.305

	Update XFree86 Information.
	[tron, ticket #12]

xsrc/Makefile					1.44

	Remove code handling "contrib" directory.
	[tron, ticket #13]

etc/pam.d/sshd					1.6-1.7

	Make the SSH daemon work again if PAM is enabled.
	[jwise, ticket #19]

etc/pam.d/xserver				1.3

	pam_self is "required" not just sufficient to authorize the Xserver.
	[jwise, ticket #20]

lib/libpam/modules/pam_unix/pam_unix.c		1.6

	Clear the authorization token at the entry of each loop, so that
	we get a chance to re-enter.
	[christos, ticket #22]

lib/libpam/modules/pam_ssh/pam_ssh.c		1.9

	Remove debugging printf's.
	[christos, ticket #23]

libexec/getty/main.c				1.47

	Print ptyfs ptys properly.
	[christos, ticket #24]

libexec/telnetd/utility.c			1.28

	Handle printing ptyfs pty names.
	[christos, ticket #25]

sys/dev/cgd_crypto.c				1.4

	[dan, ticket #26]

distrib/sets/lists/base/shl.mi			1.305
lib/libc/shlib_version				1.162
lib/libc/sys/Makefile.inc			1.157
lib/libpthread/pthread_cancelstub.c		1.11
lib/libpthread/shlib_version			1.8

	Interpose cancellation points in pollts() and pselect(), bringing us
	to libc.so.12.127 and libpthread.so.0.6.
	[kleink, ticket #27]

sys/arch/xen/i386/hypervisor_machdep.c		1.5

	Avoid loosing upcalls in stipending() by checking evtchn_upcall_pending
	with upcalls unmasked.
	[bouyer, ticket #29]

sys/arch/xen/i386/vector.S			1.7

	When handling a defered event, unmasking it isn't enouth, we also need
	to check if the corresponding bit needs to be set in
	evtchn_pending_sel, and eventually force an upcall (if we got a second
	event when this one what being handled). For now to this by calling
	hypervisor_enable_irq(), this could be rewritten in inline assembly by
	someone knowing enouth about i386 assembly :)
	[bouyer, ticket #30]

sys/arch/xen/xen/ctrl_if.c			1.3

	Print the IRQ used by the domain controller.
	[bouyer, ticket #31]

sys/arch/xen/xen/evtchn.c			1.4

	Protect various IRQ and event allocation/deallocations with splhigh().
	Print the IRQ used for debug and misdirect events.
	[bouyer, ticket #32]

	Convert to ether_ioctl(), and claim IFF_SIMPLEX | IFF_MULTICAST.
	This allows IPv6 on NetBSD domU.

	Add PCI audio devices from i386/conf/GENERIC.
	[bouyer, ticket #34]

sys/arch/xen/i386/npx.c				1.4

	npxintr(): this function does the right thing if we don't try to clear
	the interrupt latch (which is probably done by the hypervisor,
	linux/xen doesn't do it either). Now the "fputest" configure test from
	pkgsrc/math/yorick works as expected.
	[bouyer, ticket #35]

sbin/sysctl/sysctl.c				1.99

	Fix possible segmentation fault when retrieving descriptions.
	[atatat, ticket #36]

sys/arch/prep/conf/INSTALL			1.33

	Add PLATFORM_IBM_6015 to INSTALL, as present in GENERIC.
	[kleink, ticket #37]

	Include <sys/select.h> explicitly rather than relying on other headers
	to do it.
	[kleink, ticket #38]

	[kleink, ticket #41]

lib/librt/sem_getvalue.3			1.2

	Add restrict qualifiers to function arguments (already in
	<semaphore.h>).
	[kleink, ticket #42]

lib/libpam/modules/pam_skey/pam_skey.c		1.2

	Make S/Key prompt compliant with RFC 2289. Patch supplied by Dave Huang
	in PR bin/23167.

	[kleink, ticket #46]

sys/arch/xen/xen/if_xennet.c			1.15

	In xennet_ioctl, we need a declaration for sc when debugging macros are
	active.  Reported on current-users by Teemu Rinta-aho.

	[atatat, ticket #52]

usr.sbin/pppd/pppd/Makefile			1.37

	If SMALLPROG is set, do not build in PAM support. While there, depend
	USE_INET6 on SMALLPROG/SMALLPROG_INET6 like ftp does it.

	ppp support.
	[martin, ticket #53]

	instead of waiting forever.
	[christos, ticket #64]

doc/README.files				patch

	Update for 3.0 branch

lib/libc/citrus/citrus_none.c			1.13

	getting on SMP systems.
	[bouyer, ticket #71]

sys/arch/xen/i386/gdt.c				1.4

	Merge 1.1.14.3 from yamt-km branch:

sys/arch/alpha/pci/pci_kn300.c			1.27
sys/arch/alpha/pci/sio_pic.c			1.33

	- Add a alpha_shared_intr_reset_strays() function that resets the  
	  stray interrupt counter for a given shared interrupt descriptor.
	- When an interrupt is successfully handled, reset the strays counter,
	  thus preventing a "slow leak" from eventually shutting off the  
	  interrupt vector. Idea taken from pci_kn300.c (which was changed
	  to use the new alpha_shared_intr_reset_strays() function).
	[thorpej, ticket #76]

usr.bin/login/login.c				1.84

	Add a colon before %m in calls to syslog(3) for consistency with other
	messages in this same file and in many other tools.
	[jmmv, ticket #77]

lib/libc/db/hash/hash.c				1.21

	Don't refuse to create a hash database on 0 length files. Treat
	them as new files the same way that the btree code does.  Note that
	we do the fstat() after the open() instead of re-using the previous
	result of the stat() to avoid races (we open with O_EXLOCK when we
	care).
	[christos, ticket #78]

sys/net/if_gre.c				1.56
sys/netinet/ip_gre.c				1.34

	Add missing flags to usage().
	[xtraeme, ticket #81]

	Fixes PR 29651.
	[chs, ticket #82]

sys/sys/fcntl.h					1.32

	Correct the comment against FKIOCTL and put the comment against FMASK
	back where it belongs.
	[skrll, ticket #83]

sys/dev/vnd.c					1.112,1.114
sys/dev/vndvar.h				1.14

	Make vnd do I/O to the underlying file from thread context. This
	allows the strategy routine to be called from interrupt context,
	fixes PR kern/29775 by Juan RP.
	Now that pool_get() is only called from thread context, change
	PR_NOWAIT to PR_WAITOK. Fix PR kern/26272 by Juergen Hannken-Illjes.
	Don't eventually leak vnx and bp on unconfigure, pointed out by
	YAMAMOTO Takashi. Instead, let the current I/O complete before
	killing the thread.
	[bouyer, ticket #85]

etc/MAKEDEV.tmpl				1.41

	Add pf to the all target.
	[peter, ticket #86]

	[yamt, ticket #88]

sys/nfs/nfs_socket.c				1.113
sys/netinet/tcp_output.c			1.129

	nfsrv_rcv: don't do so_receive from socket upcall context.
	While there's little benefits, it complicates locking and confuses
	flow control.
	tcp_output: lock reass queue when building sack.

sys/dev/ic/rtl81x9reg.h				1.12
sys/dev/ic/rtl81x9var.h				1.18

	- restructure tx descriptor handling code to decouple
	  number of tx descriptors, number of rx descriptors, and number of
	  mbufs.
	- bump number of tx descriptors for rtl8169. 64 doesn't seem to be
	  sufficient when doing TSO.
	[yamt, ticket #91]

sys/dev/ic/rtl8169.c				1.16

	re_encap: set RTK_TDESC_CMD_IPCSUM if any of checksum offloading is
	requested. Otherwise, RTK_TDESC_CMD_TCPCSUM/UDPCSUM don't seem to
	make any effect.
	[yamt, ticket #92]

sys/arch/xen/i386/gdt.c				1.3

	Don't bother to allocate gdt slots for tss as we don't actually
	use them.
	[yamt, ticket #93]

sys/dev/ic/rtl8169.c				1.17

	- use IFQ_POLL/DEQUEUE rather than IF_DEQUEUE/PREPEND.
