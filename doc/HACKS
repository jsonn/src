hack	netstat ieee1394 address printing.
mdate	14 Nov 2000
who	matt
file	lib/libc/net/getnameinfo.c	: 1.32 : 497 : 503
descr
	Because the current implementation of IP over IEEE1394, the
	fw device address contains more than just the IEEE1394 EUI-64.
	So when printing out IEEE1394 addresses, ignore the extra stuff.

hack	xterm vs. libterm
mdate	01 Aug 2000
who	jdc
file	xsrc/xc/programs/xterm/main.c	: 1.2 : 3609 : 3614
pr	10383
descr
	In order to extend the termcap string over 1023 bytes, a ZZ entry was
	introduced to point to a memory location containing the full entry.
	Without this hack, xterm will export a termcap containing the ZZ
	entry, which will then be ignored by libterm.  As xterm modifies the
	exported termcap, this would cause those modifications to be ignored.

hack	wi-at-big-endian-bus
cdate	15 Mar 2002
who	martin
file	dev/ic/wireg.h
descr	Add an option to access the underlying bus in big endian byte order
	to work around deficiencies in bus_space_{read,write}_* macros.
	Those don't allow the implementation of a proper pcmcia bus space
	tag.

hack	specific knowledge of colours in curses code
cdate	Sun Apr  6 11:05:24 BST 2003
who	jdc
file	lib/libcurses/color.c : r1.24
descr
	Swap red/blue and yellow/cyan colours for COLOR_OTHER.
	Fix is to enhance libtermcap to understand terminfo-style % sequences.

hack	Compensation for differing types of LINUX_USRSTACK and USRSTACK
cdate	21 Aug 2003
who	he
file	sys/miscfs/procfs/procfs_linux.c : 1.14
descr
	Not all ports have LINUX_USRSTACK and/or USRSTACK defined as
	literals/constants, but refer to variables of a type which is
	not "unsigned long", causing compilation of procfs_linux.c to
	fail with "makes integer from pointer without a cast".  This
	is observed on e.g. the sun3 port.  Ideally the "types" for
	symbols should be consistent across all ports.

hack	GCC2 isn't C99
cdate	5 December 2003
who	mrg
file	gnu/dist/binutils/ld/ldlex.c: r1.2
descr
	ldlex.c is generated from ldlex.l and we get macro redefinition
	errors from it if __STDC_VERSION__ is not C99 compliant.  This
	hack forces NetBSD 1.6 and later systems to also include <stdint.h>
	to get the relevant definitions.  This hack should be backed out
	when all platforms have switched away from GCC2.

hack	gcc-strict-aliasing
cdate	6 August 2004
who	junyoung
pr	26516
file	src/usr.sbin/racoon/racoon/Makefile : 1.21
descr
	GCC issues a warning "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break
	strict-aliasing rules" when compiling
	crypto/dist/kame/racoon/crypto/openssl.c with -O[23s]. Note that this
	is due to use of type casting in a non-standard way in the code and
	not a compiler bug. Once a new release of KAME with a proper fix
	applied is imported this should be backed out.

	GCC 4.1 gets many uninitialised variable warnings wrong.  We should
	really audit all the old hacks like this when older compilers are
	removed from the tree, as many are probably no longer required.
	The problem is that it does not recognize initialization via function
	call pointer. I.e.
		int p;
		foo(&p);
	does not mark p as initialized.

	cdate	Wed Nov  5 11:03:13 EST 2003
	who	mrg
	file	gnu/usr.bin/gcc3/backend/Makefile : 1.11
	descr
		ra-colorize.c causes a whole spew of unreferenced .L* local
		symbols.  using -O0 (or even -O2 reportedly) avoids the problem.
		Note this has been fixed in 3.3.3 at least on m68k,
		but it hasn't been confirmed on sun2/m68000.
		(it's too slow even on emulator and unlikely to build
		 toolchains on sun2 with its maximum 4MB RAM)

	cdate	Tue Feb 22 13:43:25 EST 2005
	who	christos
	file	src/dist/bind/lib/dns/rbt.c
	descr
		The macppc gcc-3.3 compiler miscompiles rbt.c when these
		functions are inlined. The error is:
		.* named[368]: rbt.c:1584: INSIST(child != (void *)0) >failed
		.* named[368]: exiting (due to assertion failure)
		This is reportedly fixed in gcc-3.4

	descr
		With COMPAT_16 or previous enabled (which enables
		ELF_INTERP_NON_RELOCATABLE) a recent ld.elf_so will
		load and run at address 0.  The check to fix this in
		rev 1.107 only checks the first psection of the ELF
		executable, which may not be loadable.  A more correct
		fix is to check the first loadable psection instead of
		just the first psection.
