This file contains important information on the NetBSD 1.6.2 release that
did not make it into the main documentation.

[cats]

	The xserver does not currently build for cats. This will be hopefully
	fixed shortly. If absolutely required the X builds from
	1.6.1 could be used, but those have known security issues as 
	described in NetBSD-SA2003-015. The rest of the X sets from arm32 
	builds are included.

[acorn32]

	The xserver was not able to be built for this release due to a lack
	of resources/hardware availability. This can be built from source
	using the netbsd-1-6-PATCH002 tag on the xsrc tree. The rest of the X 
	sets from arm32 builds are included.
