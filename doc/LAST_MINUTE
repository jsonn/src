#	$NetBSD: LAST_MINUTE,v 1.1.2.6 2002/12/22 13:40:56 lukem Exp $

This file contains important information on the NetBSD 1.6 release that
did not make it into the main documentation.


[all]
	The Kerberos ticket forwarding programs kf(1) and kfd(8) have
	some security issues, and should be disabled to ensure that
	they can not be used, even though the server (kfd(8)) is not
	enabled by default.

	They can be disabled with:
		chmod 0 /usr/bin/kf /usr/libexec/kfd


[alpha]
	The X sets (xbase.tgz, xcomp.tgz, xcontrib.tgz, xfont.tgz,
	xmisc.tgz, and xserver.tgz) available before "Sep 25 18:24"
	contained zero-length manual pages.  (This was reported in
	problem report [port-alpha/13384].)

	The MD5 entries for the corrected sets are:
		MD5 (text.tgz) = 251f34211dd70719641e9691c5631329
		MD5 (xbase.tgz) = b4eb8b0b0db0f1215335afdc1aaee4f8
		MD5 (xcomp.tgz) = 8e0d3f9398527e3bd2e4b1cc64cc1fbd
		MD5 (xcontrib.tgz) = 4a52853a21cd5e87b3296819ca6e7b4b
		MD5 (xfont.tgz) = 3b345adb0b6b7d526a5803dca0e44ca5
		MD5 (xmisc.tgz) = be2d4d9aca9cc6e427c0549625a539a6
		MD5 (xserver.tgz) = 3e7924da9b73f7dea528fd376d549da5


[amiga]
	The loadbsd program does not yet have the ability to load
	ELF kernels (the new executable format for NetBSD 1.6), so
	the only way to boot NetBSD is using the bootblock method.
	Because some Amigas are unable to boot from bootblocks,
	there is an experimental program provided to emulate booting
	from the bootblocks.  The program is runbootblock, which
	will be found in the amiga/installation/misc directory.


[atari]
	The xbase.tgz set that was available before "Sep 16 13:57"
	was a "shared" copy with other m68k ports.  However, as the
	atari currently requires its own copy of this set this was
	corrected on that time.

	The sum entries for the correct set are:
	    BSDSUM    29517 2522 xbase.tgz
	    CKSUM     4259307667 2581755 xbase.tgz
	    MD5       MD5 (xbase.tgz) = 7b65569fd7143ff1c8baf86a19c04f61
	    SYSVSUM   15857 5043 xbase.tgz


[m68k MACHINE_ARCH, including: amiga, atari, mac68k, x68k]
	A problem with the floating point emulator used by certain
	Motorola 680x0-based systems can cause erratic faults in
	applications that use floating point calculations. 
	Systems using the 68020 or 68030 microprocessor but lacking
	a 68881 or 68882 floating point processor may be vulnerable
	to the flaw.
	This issue may affect both installation and normal operation.


[cats]
	The xserver.tgz is built from XFree86 4.x sources (xsrc/xfree/xc),
	not XFree86 3.x sources (xsrc/xc).  The rest of the X sets are
	still the shared arm32 XFree86 3.x sets.


[sparc]
	A bug in the creation of the boot floppies meant that the
	first disk was not bootable by the Sparc PROM because a
	Sun disk label is not present in the images.

	The following is a uuencoded gzipped Sun disk label suitable
	for writing to the start of a floppy that contains the "disk1"
	image.  Save the following paragraph to a temporary file
	"tmpfile", and write it to a floppy which already contains
	the NetBSD 1.6 "disk1" floppy image with:
		uudecode -p tmpfile | gunzip -c | dd of=/dev/rfd0a

begin 644 floppylabel.gz
M'XL("$2^!3X"`V9L;W!P>6QA8F5L`&-@&`5#``2@L)@8A!!2W`[D&GIKW\5W
)`&@@52,``@``
`
end

	This problem has been solved for the next release.
