sys/dev/ic/hme.c				1.69, 1.70, 1.73
sys/dev/ic/gem.c				1.83

	hme.c rev 1.69: tcp4csum-rx and udp4csum is not enabled
	properly due to lack of "else" statement.
	hme.c rev 1.70: local ether_cmp() funcion has a wrong return
	value, so multicast is not set properly.
	hme.c rev 1.71, gem.c rev 1.83: These chips are configured to
	calculate RX packet checksum from offset ETHER_HDR_LEN +
	sizeof(struct ip), so if RX packets has IP options headers the
	drivers have to deduct the sum of the IP options header part.
	But there is a bug in the deduction calculation, so if
	tcp4csum-rx or udp4csum-rx are enabled all RX TCP/UDP packets
	with IP option headers will be discarded.
