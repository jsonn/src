#       $NetBSD: CHANGES-4.0,v 1.1.4.5 2006/12/03 21:10:53 tron Exp $

A complete list of changes from the initial NetBSD 4.0 branch on
1 December 2006 until the 4.0 release:

gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local		patched by hand
sys/sys/param.h					patched by hand

	Welcome to 4.0_BETA2

sys/lib/libsa/dosfs.c				1.11

	make bootxx_msdos fit in 8k again; thanks, __internal_memset_, for
	spilling registers all over the place.
	[dogcow, ticket #240]

sys/uvm/uvm_swap.c				1.114

	We are required to hold uvm.swap_data_lock here too.
	[elad, ticket #241]

sys/dev/pci/ahcisata.c				1.2

	Don't call the done callback twice if a special action is waiting on
	the queue. Don't forget to free the xfer in the normal bio path.
	[bouyer, ticket #242]

usr.bin/msgc/msg_sys.def			1.37

	Eliminate an alloca(3) use. This is required for USE_SSP builds to
	complete.
	[tls, ticket #243]

sys/conf/Makefile.kern.inc			1.95

	Add arch/xen/i386/gdt.c to list of kernel files that do variable-size
	allocations on the stack. This allocation could potentially be quite
	large -- I am not sure how to best fix that.
	Fixes USE_SSP i386 build.sh failure.
	[tls, ticket #244]
