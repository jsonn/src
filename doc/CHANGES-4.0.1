dist/nawk/lex.c					1.8

	Bring back the fix in revision 1.6, apparently accidentally lost

games/larn/header.h				1.18 via patch
games/larn/main.c				1.21
games/larn/scores.c				1.16 via patch

	manipulate the effective uid, only the effective gid.
	Use mkstemp to make the temporary files used when you win.
	[dholland, ticket #1067]

sys/arch/acorn32/stand/boot32/boot32.c		1.31

	Now a small kernel will boot up on my RISC-PC.
	[chris, ticket #1063]

	trap.c by ragge nearly 13 years ago.
	[matt, ticket #1090]

	for more people than the old (also broken) behavior. This fixes
	PR bin/36506 and PR bin/38103.
	[tron, ticket #1091]

lib/libc/locale/mbrlen.3			1.9
