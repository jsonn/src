usr.bin/vi/common/line.c			1.7

	Flush the current line cache on every operation on the DB.
	We can't keep a reference to data returned by libdb after a subsequent
	call to any other libdb function on that DB.

sys/dev/microcode/isp/asm_2100.h		1.4-1.5

	Revert ISP2100 firmware to Qlogic revision 1.19.16 (the version that 
	shipped with NetBSD 1.5).  With all newer versions available to us, 
	we have seen some adapters crash -- and fail to respond to 
	reset -- under certain heavy load conditions.  This version appears 
	stable under heavy load with the current driver on multiple systems 
	on which we can reproduce the failure with newer versions.
