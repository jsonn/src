usr.sbin/rpc.yppasswdd/yppasswdd_mkpw.c		1.12

	Problem: rpc.yppasswdd didn't work if invoked with the -noshell option.

	Reason: In routine make_passwd() in yppasswdd_mkpw.c, fgets() is used
	to read master.passwd line-by-line. The lines are then parsed using  
	pw_scan(), without removing the trailing from the line. pw_scan() 
	fills in the shell name into pw.pw_shell, including the trailing. 
	
	Subsequently, rpc.yppasswdd calls pw_copy(), which copies master.passwd
	to ptmp, updating the entry for pw.pw_name. pw_copy() terminates the   
	updated entry with an additonal , so that there is now an empty line 
	in ptmp.
	        
	Finally, rpc.yppasswdd calls pw_mkdb(3), which exec's /usr/sbin/pwd_mkdb
	to install ptmp to master.passwd (and to create the pwd.db and spwd.db  
	data bases). pwd_mkdb chokes on the empty ptmp line.
	
	Fix: remove the trailing from the buffer fgets() returns. As a side
	effect, this gets us some additional error checking.
