A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 2.1 release to the NetBSD 2.1.1
release

File						Revision(s)
----						--------
sys/sys/param.h                                 patch
share/tmac/doc-common                           patch
gnu/usr.bin/groff/tmac/mdoc.local               patch

	Welcome to 2.1.0_STABLE

doc/README.files				patch

	Update for release and new CHANGES file.

sys/netinet6/icmp6.c				1.111

	In icmp6_redirect_output(), sip6 is initialised to point to the
	data area of m0. But m0 may be freed later, so trying to use
	sip6 at the end of this function is wrong. My guess is that
	we want to reference the data area of m (the mbuf about to be
	send) instead at this point.  Fix a panic on Xen (where a data
	area of a mbuf may be unmapped when the mbuf is freed), and
	probably potential data/pool corruption in other cases.
	[bouyer, ticket #5938]

share/man/man4/fast_ipsec.4			1.2-1.3

	Fix Dd argument; new sentence, new line; sort sections;
	typo fixes.
	[jmc, ticket #5946]

distrib/sets/lists/base/md.ibmnws		delete
distrib/sets/lists/base/mi			1.576
distrib/sets/lists/man/md.ibmnws		delete
distrib/sets/lists/man/mi			1.835 via patch
gnu/usr.sbin/Makefile				1.14

	Build ncdcs on everything. Allows better set sharing (and
	we don't exclude other 'system specific' binaries from other
	builds ala sunlabel, etc), and nuke only md man page in existence,
	simplifying man.tgz set sharing.
	[jmc, ticket #5948]

sys/arch/sparc/sparc/cpu.c			1.193

	Compute c_totalsize for split caches correctly: it's max, not sum (and
	we even have that documented in cache.h).  Initialize c_nlines for
	split caches.
	This should fix srmmu cache flush routines for split I/D caches that
	has been broken since cache.c revision 1.79 started using c_nlines.
	[uwe, ticket #5950]

sys/kern/uipc_socket.c				1.112

	Check the argument to SO_LINGER.
	[nathanw, ticket #5939]

sys/kern/kern_exec.c				patch

	Don't clear unconditionally P_SUGID when we exec. Clear it only when
	the real and effective user and group ids match.
	[dan, ticket #5955]

dist/ntp/ntpd/ntpd.c				1.8

	Use group-id from ``gr'' and not ``pw''.
	Fixes security issue addressed by CAN-2005-2496.
	[dan, ticket #5958]

sys/dev/scsipi/scsipi_ioctl.c			1.54

	Don't claim there is a data in or out phase if the datalen is 0
	(userland shouldn't claim it either, but a buggy software shouldn't
	be able to crash the kernel anyway). Should fix port-sparc64/31925
	by Johan A.van Zanten (which should really be kern/31925).
	Analysed and patch tested by Martin Husemann.
	[bouyer, ticket #5961]

distrib/utils/sysinst/util.c			1.137

	Don't redisplay the title messages before displaying sub-menus
	during set selection (eg selecting the X sets).
	libcurses got changed earlier in the year so that the erase (and
	refresh) of the message window caused all the unchanged spaces
	to be redrawn overwriting most of the main set selection window.
	[dsl, ticket #5964]

sys/uvm/uvm_glue.c				1.90

	Remove the assertion in uvm_swapout_threads() about LSONPROC lwps
	not running on the same CPU as the swapper.  l_stat is protected by
	sched_lock, which isn't held here, so we can race with that lwp
	starting to run and see its l_cpu not updated yet, as in PR 31870.
	we check l_stat again in uvm_swapout() while holding sched_lock,
	so the race itself is harmless.
	[bouyer, ticket #5965]

sbin/newfs/mkfs.c				1.92

	don't set fs_maxsymlinklen and fs_old_inodefmt twice,
	we set them correctly the first time.  fixes PR 26995.
	[chs, ticket #5971]

sys/kern/vfs_vnops.c				1.99

	vput() -> vrele(). Vnode is already unlocked.
	With much help from Pavel Cahyna.  PR#32005
	[hannken, ticket #5983]

sys/miscfs/kernfs/kernfs_vnops.c		1.114 via patch

	Fix 64 bit truncation problem allowing to read arbitrary kernel memory.
	[christos, ticket #10155]
