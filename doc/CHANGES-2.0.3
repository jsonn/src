#	$NetBSD: CHANGES-2.0.3,v 1.1.2.12 2005/05/06 23:51:35 snj Exp $

A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 2.0.2 release to the NetBSD 2.0.3
release.

File						Revision(s)
----						--------
sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_bmap.c				patch

	Fix a silent truncation problem that could cause corruption with large
	FFSv1 file systems.
	[mycroft, ticket #1035]

sys/sys/param.h					patch

	Welcome to 2.0.2_STABLE

sys/netinet/tcp_input.c				patch

	If an echoed RFC 1323 time stamp appears to be later than the current

	prevents ending up with a negative RTT and panicking later.
	[christos, ticket #1401]

	When adding or deleting multicast addresses, only change

	Make sure that prefixes get purged.  Fixes PR#21189,
	PR#25968, and PR#37873.

sys/kern/uipc_mbuf2.c				1.19

	In m_pulldown avoid a prepend to the next mbuf in the chain if the
