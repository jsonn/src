#	$NetBSD: CHANGES-2.0.4,v 1.1.2.5 2005/10/31 20:56:57 tron Exp $

A complete list of changes from the NetBSD 2.0.3 update to the NetBSD 2.0.4
update.

File						Revision(s)
----						--------
sys/sys/param.h					patch

	Update to 2.0.3_STABLE

sys/arch/sparc/sparc/cpu.c			1.193

	Compute c_totalsize for split caches correctly: it's max, not sum (and
	we even have that documented in cache.h).  Initialize c_nlines for
	split caches.
	This should fix srmmu cache flush routines for split I/D caches that
	has been broken since cache.c revision 1.79 started using c_nlines.
	[uwe, ticket #5950]

sys/kern/uipc_socket.c				1.112

	Check the argument to SO_LINGER.
	[nathanw, ticket #5939]

sys/kern/kern_exec.c				patch

	Don't clear unconditionally P_SUGID when we exec. Clear it only when
	the real and effective user and group ids match.
	[dan, ticket #5955]

dist/ntp/ntpd/ntpd.c				1.8

	Use group-id from ``gr'' and not ``pw''.
	Fixes security issue addressed by CAN-2005-2496.
	[dan, ticket #5958]
