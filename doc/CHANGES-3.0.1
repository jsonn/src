sys/kern/kern_systrace.c			1.50 via patch

	in systrace_make_msg(), sleep uninterruptibly while waiting for

	[bouyer, ticket #1125]

lib/libc/rpc/xdr_rec.c				1.26

	John Kohl: xdr_rec.c missing a bugfix for an improper security
	check.  The correct way to check for a zero record length is to
	check for it without the LAST_FRAG marker in it, since it's legal
	to send a LAST_FRAG marker with 0 bytes of data.  PR#32572

	[christos, ticket #1128]
