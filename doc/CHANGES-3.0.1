doc/README.files				patch

	Update for release and new CHANGES-3.0.1 file.

lib/libc/gen/getcwd.c				1.41

	Allow last component to be non-existing again.

	[elad, ticket #1068]

sys/kern/kern_systrace.c			1.50 via patch

	in systrace_make_msg(), sleep uninterruptibly while waiting for
	the response from the systrace daemon, so that the message protocol
	between the kernel and the daemon doesn't get out of sync.
	fixes PR 29654.
	[chs, ticket #1071]

xfree/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/nv/riva_include.h 1.2

	Sync the Nvidia drivers with XFree86's sources as of December 24th,

	[jmmv, ticket #1074]

lib/libc/gen/getcwd.c				1.42

	Revert back to revision 1.40, as requested by cube@.
	Unbreaks KDE.
	[elad, ticket #1077]

bin/systrace/intercept.c			1.26
bin/systrace/intercept.h			1.18

	Give systrace its own version of realpath() that does what it wants,
	call it intercept_realpath().  Unbreaks systrace.
	[elad, ticket #1078]

sys/fs/union/union_vfsops.c			1.32

	Change union_unmount() to not play with the fs root vnode explicitly.
	Let it get recycled along with all of the others. This is important
	as if the root vnode has already been reclaimed, then we get a panic
	when we try to vget it.  This addresses PR: kern/31382
	[wrstuden, ticket #1091]
