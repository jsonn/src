	[martti, ticket #7]

	[atatat, ticket #37]

gnu/dist/cvs/src/server.c			1.14

	Correctly fallback into the normal path when SETXID_SUPPORT is defined

	[jmc, ticket #35]

sys/netinet/ip_fil_netbsd.c			1.4

	Untangle ioctl copyin/copyout confusion. IP-Filter now actually works
	on sparc64 (and probably everywhere else).
	[martin, ticket #39]

dist/ipf/tools/ipf_y.y				1.2

	ioctl(2) "request" arguments should be ioctlcmd_t, not u_int.
	[martin, ticket #40]

sys/kern/kern_ras.c				1.8-1.9

	ras_install: don't do pool_get(PR_WAITOK) while we're holding a
	             spinlock.
	ras_fork:    don't do PR_WAITOK holding a spinlock.
	[yamt, ticket #41]

usr.sbin/ipf/ipf/Makefile			1.20

usr.sbin/ipf/ippool/Makefile			1.6
usr.sbin/ipf/ipsend/Makefile			1.23

	Simplify `bar.c: bar.y' (et al) rules by moving header dependencies
	which bar.o (not bar.c) needs to DPSRCS, and using {.ALLSRC} in the
	target now that only bar.y is a source.
	[lukem, ticket #42]

sys/dev/pci/pcidevs				1.616
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs.h				regen
sys/dev/pci/pcidevs_data.h			regen

	Correct entry for PCI vendor id 0x11af. It is assigned to Avid 
	Technology Inc. and not to Pro-Log Corporation. PR#25004
	[tron, ticket #38]

sys/kern/kern_sig.c				1.190

	If a signal is the result of trap, only invoke a supplied handler
	if it's not blocked.  Otherwise (it if it blocked or the handler
	is set to SIG_IGN) reset the signal back to its default settings
	so that a coredump can be generated.
	[matt, ticket #43]

sys/arch/macppc/macppc/machdep.c		1.131
sys/arch/powerpc/oea/oea_machdep.c		1.16

	Move to softintr__init to cpu_startup and remove softintr__init call 
	for oea.
	[matt, ticket #44]

sys/dev/ic/i82557.c				1.82

	Be more careful about issuing CU_RESUME in fxp_start()--only doing
	it if we think it's probably necessary.  Then do it again in the
	tx interrupt handler, if we again think it's necessary.  This
	reduces the number of commands we issue the chip.  Prior to this
	change, the i82550 (running without extended feature set, so like
	a '559)  would sometimes fail in fxp_scb_wait() prior to issuing
	another CU_RESUME, resulting in
	        fxp0: WARNING: SCB timed out!
	messages on the console, often followed by device timeouts.
	[briggs, ticket #45]

sys/netinet/fil.c				1.62
sys/netinet/ip_lookup.c				1.2

	A few more ioctl vs. copyin changes, spotted by Bill Studenmund.
	[martin, ticket #46]

	[lukem, ticket #47]

	After re-checking the docs in response to a port-mvme68k question,
	don't claim to support D8 local-bus->VMEbus transfers.
	[scw, ticket #49]

usr.bin/fstat/fstat.c				1.66

	Fix fstat core dumps when some process holds a reference in a Linux
	ext2fs filesystem.
	[aymeric, ticket #50]
