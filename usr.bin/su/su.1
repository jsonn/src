.Sh NAME
.Nm su
.Nd substitute user identity
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Kflm
.Op Fl c Ar login-class
.Op Ar login Op Ar "shell arguments"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
requests the Kerberos password for
.Ar login
(or for
.Dq Ar login Ns .root ,
if no login is provided), and switches to
that user and group ID after obtaining a Kerberos ticket granting ticket.
A shell is then executed, and any additional
.Ar "shell arguments"
after the login name
are passed to the shell.
.Nm
will resort to the local password file to find the password for
.Ar login
if there is a Kerberos error.
If
.Nm
is executed by root, no password is requested and a shell
with the appropriate user ID is executed; no additional Kerberos tickets
are obtained.
.Pp
Alternatively, if the user enters the password "s/key", authentication
will use the S/Key one-time password system as described in
.Xr skey 1 .
S/Key is a Trademark of Bellcore.
.Pp
By default, the environment is unmodified with the exception of
.Ev USER ,
.Ev HOME ,
.Ev SHELL ,
and
.Ev SU_FROM .
.Ev HOME
and
.Ev SHELL
are set to the target login's default values.
.Ev USER
is set to the target login, unless the target login has a user ID of 0,
in which case it is unmodified.
.Ev SU_FROM
is set to the caller's login.
The invoked shell is the target login's.
With the exception of
.Ev SU_FROM
this is the traditional behavior of
.Nm "" .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl K
Do not attempt to use Kerberos to authenticate the user.
.It Fl c
Specify a login class.
You may only override the default class if you're already root.
.It Fl f
If the invoked shell is
.Xr csh 1 ,
this option prevents it from reading the
.Dq Pa .cshrc
file.
.It Fl l
Simulate a full login.
The environment is discarded except for
.Ev HOME ,
.Ev SHELL ,
.Ev PATH ,
.Ev TERM ,
.Ev USER ,
and
.Ev SU_FROM .
.Ev HOME
.Ev SHELL ,
and
.Ev SU_FROM
are modified as above.
.Ev USER
is set to the target login.
.Ev PATH
is set to
is set to the path specified in the
.Pa /etc/login.conf
file (or to the default of
.Dq Pa /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/local/bin 
).
.Ev TERM
is imported from your current environment.
The invoked shell is the target login's, and
.Nm
will change directory to the target login's home directory.
.It Fl
Same as
.Fl l
.It Fl m
Leave the environment unmodified.
The invoked shell is your login shell, and no directory changes are made.
As a security precaution, if the target user's shell is a non-standard
shell (as defined by
.Xr getusershell 3 )
and the caller's real uid is
non-zero,
.Nm
will fail.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl l
and
.Fl m
options are mutually exclusive; the last one specified
overrides any previous ones.
.Pp
Only users in group
.Dq wheel
(normally gid 0),
as listed in
.Pa /etc/group ,
can
.Nm
to
.Dq root ,
unless group wheel does not exist or has no members.
(If you do not want anybody to be able to
.Nm
to
.Dq root ,
make
.Dq root
the only member of group
.Dq wheel ,
which is the default.)
.Pp
By default (unless the prompt is reset by a startup file) the super-user
prompt is set to
.Dq Sy \&#
to remind one of its awesome power.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To  become user username and use the same environment as in original shell, execute:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
su username
.Ed

To become user username and use environment as if full login would be performed,
execute:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
su -l username
.Ed

To execute arbitrary command with privileges of user username, execute:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
su username -c "command args"
.Ed

.It Ev HOME

specified above.
.It Ev PATH
Default search path of real user ID unless modified as specified above.
.It Ev TERM
Provides terminal type which may be retained for the substituted
user ID.
.It Ev USER

.Nm
unless the user ID is 0 (root).
