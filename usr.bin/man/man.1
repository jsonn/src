.Sh NAME
.Nm man
.Nd display the on-line manual pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl achw
.Op Fl C Ar file
.Op Fl M Ar path
.Op Fl m Ar path
.Op Ar section
.Ar name Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility
displays the
.Bx
manual pages entitled
.Ar name .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Display all of the manual pages for a specified
.Ar section
and
.Ar name
combination.
(Normally, only the first manual page found is displayed.)
.It Fl C
Use the specified 
.Ar file
instead of the default configuration file.
This permits users to configure their own manual environment.
See
.Xr man.conf 5
for a description of the contents of this file.
.It Fl c
Copy the manual page to the standard output instead of using
.Xr more 1
to paginate it.
This is done by default if the standard output is not a terminal device.
.It Fl h
Display only the
.Dq Tn SYNOPSIS
lines of the requested manual pages.
.It Fl M
Override the list of standard directories which
.Nm
searches for manual pages.
The supplied
.Ar path
must be a colon (``:'') separated list of directories.
This search path may also be set using the environment variable
.Ev MANPATH .
The subdirectories to be searched, and their search order,
is specified by the ``_subdir'' line in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Fl m
Augment the list of standard directories which
.Nm
searches for manual pages.
The supplied
.Ar path
must be a colon (``:'') separated list of directories.
These directories will be searched before the standard directories or
the directories specified using the
.Fl M
option or the
.Ev MANPATH
environment variable.
The subdirectories to be searched, and their search order,
is specified by the ``_subdir'' line in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Fl w
List the pathnames of the manual pages which
.Nm
would display for the specified
.Ar section
and
.Ar name
combination.
.El
.Pp
The optional
.Ar section
argument restricts the directories that
.Nm
will search.
The
.Nm
configuration file (see
.Xr man.conf 5 )
specifies the possible
.Ar section
values that are currently available.
If only a single argument is specified or if the first argument is
not a valid section,
.Nm
assumes that the argument is the name of a manual page to be displayed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width MANPATHX
.It Ev MACHINE
As some manual pages are intended only for specific architectures,
.Nm
searches any subdirectories,
with the same name as the current architecture,
in every directory which it searches.
Machine specific areas are checked before general areas.
The current machine type may be overridden by setting the environment
variable
.Ev MACHINE
to the name of a specific architecture.
.It Ev MANPATH
The standard search path used by
.Nm
may be overridden by specifying a path in the
.Ev MANPATH
environment
variable.
The format of the path is a colon (``:'') separated list of directories.
The subdirectories to be searched as well as their search order
is specified by the ``_subdir'' line in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Ev PAGER
The pagination command used for writing the output.
If the
.Ev PAGER
environment variable is null or not set, the standard pagination program
.Xr more 1
will be used.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/man.conf -compact

.Sh BUGS
The on-line manual pages are, by necessity, forgiving toward stupid
display devices, causing a few manual pages to be not as nicely formatted
as their typeset counterparts.
