.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm quota

.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v | Fl q
.Nm quota
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl v | Fl q
.Ar user
.Nm quota
.Op Fl g
.Op Fl v | Fl q

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Quota
displays users' disk usage and limits.
By default only the user quotas are printed.
.Pp
Options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g
Print group quotas for the group 
of which the user is a member.
The optional
.Fl u
flag is equivalent to the default.
.It Fl v
.Nm quota
will display quotas on filesystems
where no storage is allocated.
.It Fl q
Print a more terse message,
containing only information
on filesystems where usage is over quota.
.El
.Pp
Specifying both
.Fl g
and
.Fl u
displays both the user quotas and the group quotas (for
the user).
.Pp
Only the super-user may use the
.Fl u
flag and the optional
.Ar user
argument to view the limits of other users.
Non-super-users can use the the
.Fl g
flag and optional
.Ar group
argument to view only the limits of groups of which they are members.
.Pp
The
.Fl q
flag takes precedence over the
.Fl v
flag.
.Pp
.Nm Quota
tries to report the quotas of all mounted filesystems.
If the filesystem is mounted via
.Nm NFS ,
it will attempt to contact the
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
daemon on the
.Nm NFS
server.
For
.Nm FFS
filesystems, quotas must be turned on in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
If
.Nm quota
exits with a non-zero status, one or more filesystems
are over quota.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width quota.group -compact
.It Pa quota.user
located at the filesystem root with user quotas
.It Pa quota.group
located at the filesystem root with group quotas
.It Pa /etc/fstab
to find filesystem names and locations
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm quota
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
