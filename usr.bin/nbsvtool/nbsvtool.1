.Sh NAME
.Nm nbsvtool
.Nd create and verify detached signatures of files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nbsvtool
.OP Fl v
.Op Fl a Ar anchor-certificates
.Op Fl c Ar certificate-chain
.Op Fl f Ar certificate-file
.Op Fl k Ar private-key-file
.Op Fl u Ar required-key-usage
.Ar command
.Ar args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create and verify detached X509 signatures of files.
Private keys and certificates are expected to be PEM encoded,
signatures are in PEM/SMIME format.
.\" XXX: pointer to detailed description/documentation of these formats
.\" XXX: pointer to concept explanation: key, certificate, signature,
.\"      certificate chain
.Pp
Supported commands:
.Bl -tag -width Xverify-codeXfileX[signature]XXX
.It sign Ar file
Sign
.Ar file ,
placing the signature in
.Ar file Ns Pa .sp7 .
The options
.Fl f
and
.Fl k
are required for this command.
.It verify Ar file Op Ar signature
Verify signature for
.Ar file .
If
.Ar signature
is not specified,
.Ar file Ns Pa .sp7
is used.
.It verify-code Ar file Op Ar signature
This is a short cut for verify with the option
.Fl u
code.
.El
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width XfXcertificateXchainXfileXXX
.It Fl a Ar anchor-certificates
A file containing one or more (concatenated) keys that are considered
trusted.
.It Fl c Ar certificate-chain
A file containing additional certificates that will be added to the signature
when creating one.
They will be used to fill missing links in the trust chain when
verifying the signature.
.It Fl f Ar certificate-file
A file containing the certificate to use for signing.
The certificate must match the key given by
.Fl k .
.It Fl k Ar private-key-file
A file containing the private key to use for signing.
.It Fl u Ar required-key-usage
Verify that the extended key-usage attribute in the signing certificate
matches
.Ar required-key-usage .
Otherwise, the signature is rejected.
.Ar key usage
can be one of:
.Dq ssl-server ,
.Dq ssl-client ,
.Dq code ,
or
.Dq smime .
.It Fl v
Print verbose information about the signing certificate.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create signature file
.Pa hello.sp7
for file
.Pa hello .
The private key is found in file
.Pa key ,
the matching certificate is in
.Pa cert ,
additional certificates from
.Pa cert-chain
are included in the created signature.
.Dl nbsvtool -k key -f cert -c cert-chain sign hello hello.sp7
.Pp
Verify that the signature
.Pa hello.sp7
is valid for file
.Pa hello
and that the signing certificate allows code signing.  Certificates
in
.Pa anchor-file
are considered trusted, and there must be a certificate chain from one
of those certificates to the signing certificate.
.Dl nbsvtool -a anchor-file verify-code hello hello.sp7
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr openssl_smime 1
.\" XXX: pointer to X509 documentation, CA setup
.Sh CAVEATS
As there is currently no default trust anchor, you must explicilty
specify one with
.Fl a ,
otherwise no verification can succeed.
