.Sh NAME
.Nm nbsvtool
.Nd creates and verifies detached signatures of files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nbsvtool
.Op Fl a Ar anchor-certificates
.Op Fl c Ar certificate-chain
.Op Fl f Ar certificate-chain
.Op Fl k Ar keyfile
.OP Fl u Ar required-keyusage
.OP Fl v
command
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create and verify detached signatures of files.
.Nm
has two modes, signature creation and verification.
.Pp
The signature mode requires the options
.Fa k
and
.Fa c .
.Pp
The command
.Ql verify-code
is an alias for
.Ql -u code verify .
.Pp
Supported options:
.Pp
.Fl a Ar trust anchor
trust anchor that will use to verify the certificate signing the request.
.Pp
.Fl c Ar certificate chain file
Additional certificates that will be added to the signature
when creating one.
For verification it is used to fill missing links in the trust chain.
.Pp
.Fl f Ar certificate file
The certicate file to use when creating signatures.
The certicate needs to match the key given by
.Fl k .
This is enforced by the program.
.Pp
.Fl k Ar private key
The private key file to use when creating signatures.
.Pp
.Fl u Ar key usage
key usage is one of:
.Ql ssl-server ,
.Ql ssl-client ,
.Ql code ,
or
.Ql smime .
This verifies the extended key-usage attribute in the signer certificate.
.Pp
.Fl v
Print verbose information of the signer.
.Sh EXIT CODES
0 every thing ok,
.Pp
everything else signals an error.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.D1 nbsvtool -k key -c cert-chain sign hello hello.sp7
.D1 nbsvtool verify-code hello hello.sp7
.D1 nbsvtool -u code verify file file.sp7
.D1 nbsvtool -a anchor-file verify file.sp7
