.Sh NAME
.Nm audiorecord
.Nd record audio files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl afhV
.Op Fl b Ar balance
.Op Fl C Ar ctl
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl e Ar encoding
.Op Fl i Ar info
.Op Fl m Ar monvol
.Op Fl P Ar precision
.Op Fl p Ar input
.Op Fl s Ar rate
.Op Fl t Ar time
.Op Fl v Ar volume
.Op files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program copies the audio devices to the named audiofile, or the standard
output if no file is named.
The output file will contain a Sun/NeXT audio header.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 123456
.It Fl a
Append to the specified file, rather than overwriting.
.It Fl b
Set the balance to
.Ar balance .
This value must be between 0 and 63.
.It Fl C
Set the audio control device to be
.Ar ctl .
The default is
.Pa /dev/audioctl0 .
.It Fl d
Set the audio device to be
.Ar device .
The default is
.Pa /dev/audio0 .
.It Fl e
Set encoding to either
.Dq alaw ,
.Dq ulaw
or
.Dq linear .
.It Fl f
Force.  Normally when appending to audiofiles using the
.Fl a
option, the sample rates must match.  The
.Fl f
option will allow a discrepancy to be ignored.
.It Fl h
Print a help message.
.It Fl i
If the audio device cannot be opened, exit now rather than wait for it.
.It Fl m
Set the monitor volume.
.It Fl P
Set the precision.  This value is the number of bits per sample, and is
normally either
.Dq 8
or
.Dq 16 ,
though the values
.Dq 24
and
.Dq 32
are also valid.
.It Fl p
Set the output port to
.Ar port .
The valid values of
.Ar port
are
.Dq speaker ,
.Dq headphone
and
.Dq line .
.It Fl s
Set the sampling rate.  This value is per-second.  Typical values are
8000, 44100 and 48000, which are the telephone, CD Audio and DAT Audio
default sampling rates.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
.It Fl V
Be verbose.
.It Fl v
Set the volume (gain) to
.Ar volume .
This value must be between 0 and 255.
.El
.Sh BUGS
Many audio device hardware is limited in capabilities.  Any attempt
to use an audio device beyond it's capabilities will result in an
error.  This program is not finished and will become much more
versatile in it's understanding of the audio device and the desired
output.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program was first seen in SunOS 5.  The
.Nx
.Nm
was first made available in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Nm
program was written by Matthew R. Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>.
