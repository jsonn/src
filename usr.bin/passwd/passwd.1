.Sh NAME
.Nm passwd ,
.Nm yppasswd
.Nd modify a user's password
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl y
.Op Ar user
.Nm yppasswd
.Op Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
changes the user's local or YP password.  First, the user is prompted
for their current password.
If the current password is correctly typed, a new password is
requested.
The new password must be entered twice to avoid typing errors.
.Pp
The new password should be at least six characters long and not
purely alphabetic.
Its total length must be less than
.Dv _PASSWORD_LEN
(currently 128 characters).
Numbers, upper case letters and meta characters
are encouraged.
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl l
This option causes the password to be updated only in the local
password file.  When changing only the local password,
.Xr pwd_mkdb  8
is used to update the password databases.
.It Fl y
This forces the YP password database entry to be changed, even if
the user has an entry in the local database.  The
.Xr rpc.yppasswdd 8
daemon should be running on the YP master server.
.Nm yppasswd
is the equivalent of
.Nm
with the
.Fl y
flag.
.El
.Pp
This is the behavior if no flags are specified:
If the password is not in the local password database, then
an attempt is made to use the YP database.
The super-user is not required to provide a user's current password
if only the local password is modified.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/master.passwd -compact
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
The user database
.It Pa /etc/passwd 
A Version 7 format password file
.It Pa /etc/passwd.XXXXXX
Temporary copy of the password file
