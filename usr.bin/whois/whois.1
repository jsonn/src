.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
searches for an object in the RIPE Network Management database.
The key can be either a name (such as "Karrenberg"),a nic-handle
(such as "DK58"),
a network number ("192.87.45.0/24") or a domain name ("ripe.net").

This version of the whois client works with a version of the RIPE
database whois server that supports classless IP addresses. 
All IP network numbers are considered classless IP network numbers of
the form prefix/length, like 192.87.45.0/24 for a class C sized network
number and 128.86.0.0/16 for a class B sized network number. Any
length can be given. If no length is given, the server assumes a host
lookup (ie length 32).

By default, the server will return the first less specific network
number, which can be an exact match if available in the database.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
This causes the server to include information from
non-RIPE whois databases in the reply. Currently these are the public
parts of the US NIC and NSFnet databases. Please note that the RIPE
NCC does not maintain these databases. The information is included for
for your convenience only.
.It Fl F
fast output. Force the whois server to not reformat the output. This
can save time for large objects. The output of the RIPE whois server
will be in two letter short form. This option implies -r.
.It Fl h Ar host
Select alternate host to direct the query
.It Fl p Ar port
Connect to port 'port'
.It Fl L
lookup all less specific networks. Has effect only when looking up IP
network numbers.
.It Fl m
lookup first level more specific networks. Has effect only when
looking up IP network numbers.
.It Fl M
lookup all more specific networks. Has effect only when looking up IP
network numbers.
.It Fl r
non-recursive lookup. This will cause the server to not lookup
referenced objects.
.It Fl R
suppress referrals. Forces local copy of a domain object to be shown
even if it contains referral.
.It Fl i Ar attributes
attributes is a comma separated list of attributes.
the whois server will return all objects that match the search keys
in one of these attributes.
.It Fl s Ar sources
sources is a comma separated list of database sources. 
The whois server will only search the databases that match the
specified sources.
.It Fl S
requests the server to leave out "syntactic sugar" that may normally
be inserted in some database objects.
.It Fl t Ar type
requests the server to send a template for an object with type "type".
.It Fl v Ar type
requests the server to send a verbose template for an object with type "type".
.It Fl T Ar types
types is a comma separated list of object types.
requests the server to only send back objects that match one of the "types".
By default, whois connect to whois server both IPv6 and IPv4. If you want
to connect IPv4 only, you use
.It Fl 4
option, and if you want to connect IPv6 only, you use
.It Fl 6
option.

.Sh RIPE VERSION	
This is the RIPE version of the whois client program.
For questions refer
to <ncc@ripe.net>. For more information about the RIPE database please also
refer to <ncc@ripe.net>.

.Sh IPv6 supported
This whois support the IPv6
.Pq IP version 6
whois connections.
This whois is get the all of host's Information from nameserver, and
connect order is
.Pq if exists
IPv6 addresses of server at first and IPv4 address is later.
.Lp
.Sh BUGS
Most of the extra flags are ONLY supported by the RIPE whois server,
or copies of the same version of the software. Usage of these flags
may cause errors on other whois servers.
.Nm
depends on
.Xr getaddrinfo 3
functions and search order depends on the function.
