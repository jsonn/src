	 * write bits were set, or if an an access(2) call on the path

	 * Historic vi set the readonly bit if no write bits were set for

	 * succeed.  I'm less supportive of this semantic, but it's historic
	 * practice and the conservative approach to vi'ing files as root.

	 * does a "^Z; chmod ...".  The problem is that we'd first have to
	 * distinguish between readonly bits set because of file permissions
	 * and those set for other reasons.  That's not too hard, but deciding
	 * when to reevaluate the permissions is trickier.  An alternative
	 * might be to turn off the readonly bit if the user forces a write
	 * and it succeeds.

 * file_lock --

 * known to fail badly on some systems, and its only advantage is that
 * it occasionally works over NFS.
 *
 * Furthermore, the semantics of fcntl(2) are wrong.  The problems are
 * two-fold: you can't close any file descriptor associated with the file
 * without losing all of the locks, and you can't get an exclusive lock
 * unless you have the file open for writing.  Someone ought to be shot,
 * but it's probably too late, they may already have reproduced.  To get
 * around these problems, nvi opens the files for writing when it can and
 * acquires a second file descriptor when it can't.  The recovery files
 * are examples of the former, they're always opened for writing.  The DB
 * files can't be opened for writing because the semantics of DB are that
 * files opened for writing are flushed back to disk when the DB session
 * is ended. So, in that case we have to acquire an extra file descriptor.
