/*
 * The MARK and LMARK structures define positions in the file.  There are
 * two structures because the mark subroutines are the only places where
 * anything cares about something other than line and column.
 *
 * Because of the different interfaces used by the db(3) package, curses,
 * and users, the line number is 1 based and the column number is 0 based.
 * Additionally, it is known that the out-of-band line number is less than
 * any legal line number.  The line number is of type recno_t, as that's
 * the underlying type of the database.  The column number is of type size_t,
 * guaranteeing that we can malloc a line.
