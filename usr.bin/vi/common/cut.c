/*
 * cut --
 *	Put a range of lines/columns into a TEXT buffer.
 *
 * There are two buffer areas, both found in the global structure.  The first
 * is the linked list of all the buffers the user has named, the second is the
 * unnamed buffer storage.  There is a pointer, too, which is the current
 * default buffer, i.e. it may point to the unnamed buffer or a named buffer
 * depending on into what buffer the last text was cut.  Logically, in both
 * delete and yank operations, if the user names a buffer, the text is cut
 * into it.  If it's a delete of information on more than a single line, the
 * contents of the numbered buffers are rotated up one, the contents of the
 * buffer named '9' are discarded, and the text is cut into the buffer named
 * '1'.  The text is always cut into the unnamed buffer.
 *
 * In all cases, upper-case buffer names are the same as lower-case names,
 * with the exception that they cause the buffer to be appended to instead
 * of replaced.  Note, however, that if text is appended to a buffer, the
 * default buffer only contains the appended text, not the entire contents
 * of the buffer.
 *
 * !!!
 * The contents of the default buffer would disappear after most operations
 * in historic vi.  It's unclear that this is useful, so we don't bother.
 *
 * When users explicitly cut text into the numeric buffers, historic vi became
 * genuinely strange.  I've never been able to figure out what was supposed to
 * happen.  It behaved differently if you deleted text than if you yanked text,
 * and, in the latter case, the text was appended to the buffer instead of
 * replacing the contents.  Hopefully it's not worth getting right, and here
 * we just treat the numeric buffers like any other named buffer.

	 *
	 * Otherwise, if it's supposed to be put in a numeric buffer (usually
	 * a delete) put it there.  The rules for putting things in numeric
	 * buffers were historically a little strange.  There were three cases.
	 *
	 *	1: Some motions are always line mode motions, which means
	 *	   that the cut always goes into the numeric buffers.
	 *	2: Some motions aren't line mode motions, e.g. d10w, but
	 *	   can cross line boundaries.  For these commands, if the
	 *	   cut crosses a line boundary, it goes into the numeric
	 *	   buffers.  This includes most of the commands.
	 *	3: Some motions aren't line mode motions, e.g. d`<char>,
	 *	   but always go into the numeric buffers, regardless.  This
	 *	   was the commands: % ` / ? ( ) N n { } -- and nvi adds ^A.
	 *
	 * Otherwise, put it in the unnamed buffer.
