/*
 * !!!
 * Historical whackadoo.  The dot command `puts' the numbered buffer
 * after the last one put.  For example, `"4p.' would put buffer #4
 * and buffer #5.  If the user continued to enter '.', the #9 buffer
 * would be repeatedly output.  This was not documented, and is a bit
 * tricky to reconstruct.  Historical versions of vi also dropped the
 * contents of the default buffer after each put, so after `"4p' the
 * default buffer would be empty.  This makes no sense to me, so we
 * don't bother.  Don't assume sequential order of numeric characters.
 *
 * And, if that weren't exciting enough, failed commands don't normally
 * set the dot command.  Well, boys and girls, an exception is that
 * the buffer increment gets done regardless of the success of the put.
