 *  The space command forces an immediate update.  Sometimes, on loaded
 *  systems, this update will take a significant period of time (because all
 *  the output is buffered).  So, if the short-term load average is above
 *  "LoadMax", then top will put the cursor home immediately after the space
 *  is pressed before the next update is attempted.  This serves as a visual
 *  acknowledgement of the command.  On Suns, "LoadMax" will get multiplied by
 *  "FSCALE" before being compared to avenrun[0].  Therefore, "LoadMax"
 *  should always be specified as a floating point number.
