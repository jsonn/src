.Dt BOOTPARAMS 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bootparams
.Nd boot parameter database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/bootparams
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies the boot parameters that
.Xr diskless 8
clients may request when booting over the network.
Each client supported by this server must have an entry in the
.Nm
file containing the servers and pathnames for its
.Pa root ,
area.  It may optionally contain
.Pa swap ,
.Pa dump ,
and other entry types.
.Pp
Each line in the file
(other than comment lines that begin with a #)
specifies the client name followed by the pathnames that
the client may request by their logical names.  Names
are matched in a case-insensitive fashion, and may also
be wildcarded using shell-style globbing characters.
.Pp
The components of the line are delimited with blank or tab,
and may be continued onto multiple lines with a backslash.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dummy	root=server:/export/dummy/root \\
	swap=server:/export/dummy/swap \\
	dump=server:/export/dummy/swap
.Ed
.Pp
When the client named "dummy" requests the pathname for
its logical "root" it will be given server
.Dq Pa "server"
and pathname
.Dq Pa "/export/dummy/root"
as the response to its
.Tn RPC
request.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
netra[1-5]www*	root=server:/export/jumpstart/netra_www
.Ed
.Pp
When any client with a name matching the pattern "netra[1-5]www*"
requests the pathname for its logical "root" it will be given server
.Dq Pa "server"
and pathname
.Dq Pa "/export/jumpstart/netra_www"
as the response to its
.Tn RPC
request.  As this example implies, this is useful for setting up
Jumpstart servers for Sun clients.
.Sh NOTES
The server does not default to the localhost, and must be filled in.
