.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads and logs messages to the system console, log files, other
machines and/or users as specified by its configuration file.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging to the standard output,
and do not disassociate from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl f
Specify the pathname of an alternative configuration file;
the default is
.Pa /etc/syslog.conf .
.It Fl m
Select the number of minutes between ``mark'' messages;
the default is 20 minutes.
.It Fl s
Select ``secure'' mode, in which syslogd does not open a UDP socket but
only communicates over a
.Ux
domain socket.
This is valuable when the machine on
which syslogd runs is subject to attack over the network and it is desired
that the machine be protected from attempts to remotely fill logs
and similar attacks.
.It Fl p
Specify the pathname of an log socket.  Multiple
.Fl p
options create multiple log sockets.  If no -p arguments are created,
the default socket of
.Pa /var/run/log
is used.
.It Fl P
Specify the pathname of a file containing a list of sockets to be
created.  The format of the file is simply one socket per line.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
reads its configuration file when it starts up and whenever it
receives a hangup signal.
For information on the format of the configuration file,
see
.Xr syslog.conf 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
reads messages from the
.Ux
domain socket
.Pa /var/run/log ,
from an Internet domain socket specified in
.Pa /etc/services ,
and from the special device
.Pa /dev/klog
(to read kernel messages).
.Pp
.Nm
creates the file
.Pa /var/run/syslog.pid ,
and stores its process
id there.
This can be used to kill or reconfigure
.Nm "" .
.Pp
By using multiple
.Fl p
options, one can setup many chroot environments by passing the pathname
to the log socket
.Pa ( /var/run/log )
in each chroot area to syslogd.  For example:
.Dl syslogd -p /var/run/log -p /web/var/run/log -p /ftp/var/run/log
.Pp
note: the normal log socket must now also be passed to syslogd.
.Sh SYSLOG PROTOCOL NOTES
.Pp
The message sent to
.Nm
should consist of a single line.
The message can contain a priority code, which should be a preceding
decimal number in angle braces, for example,
.Sq Aq 5.
This priority code should map into the priorities defined in the
include file
.Aq Pa sys/syslog.h .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/syslog.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/syslog.conf
The configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/syslog.pid
The process id of current
.Nm "" .
.It Pa /var/run/log
Name of the
.Ux
domain datagram log socket.
.It Pa /dev/klog
The kernel log device.
