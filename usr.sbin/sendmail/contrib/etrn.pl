.SH NAME
etrn \- start mail queue run
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B etrn
.RI [ -w ]
.RI [ -d ]
.IR hostname
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B etrn
will use the SMTP
.B etrn
command to start mail delivery from the host given on the command line.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The normal mode of operation for
.B etrn
is to do all of its work silently.
The following options make it more verbose.
It is not necessary to make it verbose to see what it is
doing because as it works, it changes its 
.BR argv [0]
variable to reflect its current activity.
The 
.IR -w ,
watch, flag will cause
.B etrn
to show you its conversations with the mail daemons.
The 
.IR -d ,
debug, flag will expose many of the inner workings so that
it is possible to eliminate bugs.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
No enviroment variables are used.
.SH FILES
.B /etc/sendmail.cf
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR sendmail (8),
RFC 1985.
.SH BUGS
Not all mail daemons will implement 
.B etrn .
.LP
It is assumed that you are running domain names.
.SH CREDITS
Leveraged from David Muir Sharnoff's expn.pl script.
.SH AVAILABILITY
The latest version of 
.B etrn
is available in the contrib directory of the sendmail
distribution through anonymous ftp at
.IR ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/ucb/src/sendmail/ .
