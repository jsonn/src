# re-mqueue -- requeue messages from queueA to queueB based on age.
#

#
# Usage: re-mqueue [-d] queueA queueB seconds
#
#  -d		enable debugging
#  queueA	source directory
#  queueB	destination directory
#  seconds	select files older than this number of seconds 
#
# Example: re-mqueue /var/spool/mqueue /var/spool/mqueue2 2700
#
# Moves the qf* and df* files for a message from /var/spool/mqueue to
# /var/spool/mqueue2 if the df* file is over 2700 seconds old.
#
# The qf* file can't be used for age checking as it's partially re-written
# with the results of the last queue run.
#
# Rationale: With a limited number of sendmail processes allowed to run,
# messages that can't be delivered immediately slow down the ones that can.
# This becomes especially important when messages are being queued instead
# of delivered right away, or when the queue becomes excessively deep.
# By putting messages that have already failed one or more delivery attempts
# into another queue, the primary queue can be kept small and fast.
#
# On postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu, the primary sendmail daemon runs the queue
# every thirty minutes.  Messages over 45 minutues old are moved to
# /var/spool/mqueue2 where sendmail runs every hour.  Messages more than
# 3.25 hours old are moved to /var/spool/mqueue3 where sendmail runs every
# four hours.  Messages more than a day old are moved to /var/spool/mqueue4
# where sendmail runs three times a day.  The idea is that a message is
# tried at least twice in the first three queues before being moved to the
# old-age ghetto.
#
# (Each must be re-formed into a single line before using in crontab)
#

#
# N.B., the moves are done with link().  This has two effects: 1) the mqueue*
# directories must all be on the same filesystem, and 2) the file modification
# times are not changed.  All times must be cumulative from when the df*
# file was created.
