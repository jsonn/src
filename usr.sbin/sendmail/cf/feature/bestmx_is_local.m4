LOCAL_NET_CONFIG

# If we are the best MX for a site, then we want to accept
# its mail as local.  We assume we've already weeded out mail to
# UUCP sites which are connected to us, which should also have
# listed us as their best MX.
#
# Warning: this may generate a lot of extra DNS traffic -- a
# lower cost method is to list all the expected best MX hosts
# in $=w.  This should be fine (and easier to administer) for
# low to medium traffic hosts.  If you use the limited bestmx
# by passing in a set of possible domains it will improve things.
