.SH NAME
smrsh \- restricted shell for sendmail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smrsh
.B \-c
command
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I smrsh
program is intended as a replacement for
.I sh
for use in the ``prog'' mailer in
.IR sendmail (8)
configuration files.
It sharply limits the commands that can be run using the
``|program'' syntax of
.I sendmail
in order to improve the over all security of your system.
Briefly, even if a ``bad guy'' can get sendmail to run a program
without going through an alias or forward file,
.I smrsh
limits the set of programs that he or she can execute.
.PP
Briefly,
.I smrsh
limits programs to be in the directory
/usr/adm/sm.bin,
allowing the system administrator to choose the set of acceptable commands.
It also rejects any commands with the characters
`\`', `<', `>', `|', `;', `&', `$', `(', `)', `\er' (carriage return),
or `\en' (newline)
on the command line to prevent ``end run'' attacks.
.PP
Initial pathnames on programs are stripped,
so forwarding to ``/usr/ucb/vacation'',
``/usr/bin/vacation'',
``/home/server/mydir/bin/vacation'',
and
``vacation''
all actually forward to
``/usr/adm/sm.bin/vacation''.
.PP
System administrators should be conservative about populating
/usr/adm/sm.bin.
Reasonable additions are
.IR vacation (1),
.IR procmail (1),
and the like.
No matter how brow-beaten you may be,
never include any shell or shell-like program
(such as
.IR perl (1))
in the
sm.bin
directory.
Note that this does not restrict the use of shell or perl scripts
in the sm.bin directory (using the ``#!'' syntax);
it simply disallows execution of arbitrary programs.
.SH COMPILATION
Compilation should be trivial on most systems.
You may need to use \-DPATH=\e"\fIpath\fP\e"
to adjust the default search path
(defaults to ``/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ucb'')
and/or \-DCMDBIN=\e"\fIdir\fP\e"
to change the default program directory
(defaults to ``/usr/adm/sm.bin'').
