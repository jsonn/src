/*
**  SMRSH -- sendmail restricted shell
**
**	This is a patch to get around the prog mailer bugs in most
**	versions of sendmail.
**
**	Use this in place of /bin/sh in the "prog" mailer definition
**	in your sendmail.cf file.  You then create CMDDIR (owned by
**	root, mode 755) and put links to any programs you want
**	available to prog mailers in that directory.  This should
**	include things like "vacation" and "procmail", but not "sed"
**	or "sh".
**
**	Leading pathnames are stripped from program names so that
**	existing .forward files that reference things like
**	"/usr/ucb/vacation" will continue to work.
**
**	The following characters are completely illegal:
**		<  >  |  ^  ;  &  $  `  (  ) \n \r
**	This is more restrictive than strictly necessary.
**
**	To use this, edit /etc/sendmail.cf, search for ^Mprog, and
**	change P=/bin/sh to P=/usr/local/etc/smrsh, where this compiled
**	binary is installed /usr/local/etc/smrsh.
**
**	This can be used on any version of sendmail.
**
**	In loving memory of RTM.  11/02/93.
