.Sh NAME
.Nm rtsold
.Nd router solicitation daemon
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dDfm1
.Ar interface ...
.Nm rtsol
.Op Fl dD
.Ar interface ...
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rtsold
is the daemon program to send ICMPv6 Router Solicitation messages
on the specified interfaces.
If a node (re)attaches to a link,
.Nm
sends some Router Solicitations on the link destined to the link-local scope
all-routers multicast address to discover new routers
and to get non link-local addresses.
.Lp
Specifically,
.Nm
sends at most 3 Router Solicitations on an interface
after one of the following events:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Just after invocation of
.Nm
daemon.
.It
The interface is up after a temporary interface failure.
.Nm Rtsold
detects it by periodically probing if the status of the
interface is active or not.
Note that some network cards and drivers do not allow users
to extract link state.
In such cases,
.Nm
cannot detect the change of the interface status.
.It
Every one minute if
.Fl m
option is specified and
.Nm
daemon cannot get the interface status.
This feature does not conform to IPv6 neighbor discovery
specification, but is provided for mobile stations.
Default interval of router advertisements, which is on the order of 10
minutes, is slightly long for mobile stations.
This feature is provided
for such stations so that they can find new routers as soon as possible
when they attach another link.
.El
.Lp
Once
.Nm
sends a Router Solicitation, and receives a valid Router Advertisement,
it refrains from sending additional solicitations on that interface, until
the next time one of the above events occurs.
.Lp
When sending a Router Solicitation on an interface,
.Nm
includes a Source Link-layer address option if the interface
has its link-layer address.
.Pp
Upon receipt of signal
.Dv SIGUSR1 ,
.Nm
will dump the current internal state into
.Pa /var/run/rtsold.dump.
.\"
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl d
Enable debugging.
.It Fl D
Enable more debugging including to print internal timer information.
.It Fl f
.Fl f
prevents
.Nm
from becoming a daemon (foreground mode).
Warning messages are generated to standard error output,
instead of
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl m
Enable mobility support.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
sends probing packets to default routers that have advertised Router
Advertisements
when the node (re)attaches to an interface.
Moreover, if the option is specified,
.Nm
periodically sends Router Solicitation on an interface that does not support
.Dv SIOCGIFMEDIA
ioctl.
.It Fl 1
Perform only one probe.
Transmit Router Solicitation packet until valid Router Advertisement packet
arrives all the interfaces more than once, then exit.
.El
.Pp
If you invoke the program as
.Nm rtsol ,
it will behave as
.Do
.Nm
.Fl f1
.Ar interfaces
.Dc .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The program exits with 0 on success, non-zero on failures.
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/rtsold.dump -compact
.It Pa /var/run/rtsold.pid
the pid of the currently running
.Nm rtsold .
.It Pa /var/run/rtsold.dump
dumps internal state on.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command is based on the
.Nm rtsol
command, which first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.Nm rtsol
is now integrated into
.Xr rtsold 8 .
