.SH NAME
named.restart \- stop and restart the name server
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command sends a \s-1SIGKILL\s+1 to the running name server and then
starts a new one.
.SH BUGS
Does not check to see if the name server is actually running, and could
use a stale PID cache file which may result in the death of an unrelated
process.
.PP
Does not wait after killing the old server before starting a new one; since
the server could take some time to die and the new one will experience a
fatal error if the old one isn't gone by the time it starts, you can be left
in a situation where you have no name server at all.
