.Nd name daemon control interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ndc
.Ar directive
.Op Ar ... 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command allows the name server administrator to send various signals
to the name server, or to restart it.  Zero or more directives may be given,
from the following list:
.Bl -tag -width "querylog"
.It Ic status
Displays the current status of
.Xr named 8
as shown by
.Xr ps 1 .
.It Ic dumpdb
Causes
.Ic named
to dump its database and cache to
.Pa /var/tmp/named_dump.db
(uses the 
.Dv INT 
signal.)
.It Ic reload
Causes
.Ic named
to check the serial numbers of all primary and secondary zones
and to reload those that have changed (uses the 
.Dv HUP 
signal.)
.It Ic stats
Causes
.Ic named
to dump its statistics to
.Pa /var/tmp/named.stats
(uses the 
.Dv IOT 
or 
.Dv ABRT 
signal.)
.It Ic trace
Causes
.Ic named
to increment its 
.Dq tracing level 
by one.  Whenever the tracing level
is nonzero, trace information will be written to
.Pa /var/tmp/named.run .
Higher tracing levels result in more detailed information.
(Uses the 
.Dv USR1 
signal.)
.It Ic notrace
Causes
.Ic named
to set its 
.Dq tracing level 
to zero, closing 
.Pa /var/tmp/named.run , 
if it is open (uses the 
.Dv USR2 
signal.)
.It Ic querylog
Causes
.Ic named
to toggle the 
.Dq query logging 
feature, which while on will result in a
.Xr syslog 
of each incoming query (uses the 
.Dv WINCH 
signal.)  Note that query logging
consumes quite a lot of log file space.  This directive may also be given as
.Ic qrylog .
.It Ic start
Causes
.Ic named
to be started, as long as it isn't already running.
.It Ic stop
Causes
.Ic named
to be stopped, if it is running.
.It Ic restart
Causes
.Ic named
to be killed and restarted.
.El
.Sh BUGS
Arguments to
.Ic named
are not preserved by
.Ic restart ,
or known by
.Ic start .
.Pp
Some mechanism for controlling the parameters and environment should exist.
.Pp
Implemented as a
.Xr sh 1
script.
