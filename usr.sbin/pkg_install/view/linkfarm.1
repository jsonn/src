.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm linkfarm
.Nd manage symbolic links to package files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cDnRVv
.Op Fl d Ar stowdir
.Op Fl s Ar subdir
.Op Fl t Ar target
.Ar package
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to manage a "linkfarm", a directory tree of symbolic links in
.Ar target
to the files in the
.Ar package
sub-directory of
.Ar stowdir .
The default action is to create a linkfarm to a package.
.Pp
The following command-line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Check whether a package contains a linkfarm in
.Ar target .
If
.Ar package
has no symbolic links in
.Ar target
that correspond to its files, then return 0, otherwise return 1.
.It Fl D
Delete the linkfarm for
.Ar package .
.It Fl d Ar stowdir
Set
.Ar stowdir
as the directory in which
.Ar package
can be found.
The default
.Ar stowdir
is the
.Pa packages
sub-directory in the default
.Ar target
directory.
.It Fl n
Don't actually execute the commands for removing and creating the symbolic
links and directories.
.It Fl R
Delete and re-create the linkfarm for
.Ar package .
.It Fl s Ar subdir
The root of the package hierarchy for the linkfarm is the
.Ar subdir
sub-directory in the package.
By default, assume the root of the package hierarchy is simply the
.Ar package
directory.
.It Fl t Ar target
Set
.Ar target
as the directory in which to create and delete the linkfarm for
.Ar package .
The default
.Ar target
directory is
.Pa /usr/pkg
but may be overridden by the
.Ev LOCALBASE
environment variable.
.It Fl V
Print version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
Specifying
.Fl v
multiple times increases the level of verbosity.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev LOCALBASE
The standard packages directory,
.Pa /usr/pkg ,
can be overridden by specifying an alternative directory in the
.Ev LOCALBASE
environment variable.  This affects the default
.Ar target
and
.Ar stowdir
directories.
.It Ev PLIST_IGNORE_FILES
This can be used to specify files in
.Ar package
that should ignored when creating and deleting symbolic links in
.Ar target .
.Ev PLIST_IGNORE_FILES
is a space-separated list of shell glob patterns that match files relative
to the
.Ar package
directory, and it defaults to "info/dir *[~#] *.OLD *.orig *,v".
