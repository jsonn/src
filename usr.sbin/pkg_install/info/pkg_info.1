.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_info
.Nd a utility for displaying information on software packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_info
.Op Fl cdDikrRpLqImv
.Op Fl e Ar package
.Op Fl l Ar prefix
.Ar pkg-name [pkg-name ...]
.Nm pkg_info
.Fl a
.Op Ar flags
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to dump out information for packages, either packed up in
files or already installed on the system
with the
.Xr pkg_create 1
command.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar pkg-name ...
The named packages are described.  A package name may either be the name of
an installed package, the pathname to a package distribution file or a
URL to an ftp available package.
.It Fl a
Show all currently installed packages.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl p
Show the installation prefix for each package.
.It Fl q
Be ``quiet'' in emitting report headers and such, just dump the
raw info (basically, assume a non-human reading).
.It Fl c
Show the comment (one liner) field for each package.
.It Fl d
Show the long description field for each package.
.It Fl D
Show the install-message file for each package.
.It Fl f
Show the packing list instructions for each package.
.It Fl i
Show the install script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl k
Show the de-install script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl r
Show the requirements script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl m
Show the mtree file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl L
Show the files within each package.  This is different from just
viewing the packing list, since full pathnames for everything
are generated.
.It Fl e Ar pkg-name
If the package identified by
.Ar pkg-name
is currently installed, return 0, otherwise return 1.  This option
allows you to easily test for the presence of another (perhaps
prerequisite) package from a script.
.It Fl l Ar str
Prefix each information category header (see
.Fl q )
shown with
.Ar str .
This is primarily of use to front-end programs who want to request a
lot of different information fields at once for a package, but don't
necessary want the output intermingled in such a way that they can't
organize it.  This lets you add a special token to the start of
each field.
.It Fl t Ar template
Use
.Ar template
as the input to 
.Xr mktemp 3 
when creating a ``staging area.''
By default, this is the string
.Pa /tmp/instmp.XXXXXX ,
but it may be necessary to override it in the situation where
space in your
.Pa /tmp
directory is limited. Be sure to leave some number of `X' characters
for
.Xr mktemp 3
to fill in with a unique ID.
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
Note:  This should really not be necessary with pkg_info,
since very little information is extracted from each package
and one would have to have a very small 
.Pa /tmp
indeed to overflow it.
.Ed
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
Package info is either extracted from package files named on the
command line, or from already installed package information
in
.Pa /var/db/pkg/<pkg-name> .
