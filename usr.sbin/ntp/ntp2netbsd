#
#  Perl script to convert a standard distribution directory for ntpv4.0 into
#	a NetBSD source tree.
#
#  This is done as a script so that as each distribution is released,
#	only changes from the previous one need to be dealt with as
#	modifications to this script and related files.  This should
#	reduce the cost of updating from a new release of ntp by an
#	order of magnitude (or more?)
#
#  This script requires two environment variables set:
#	SRCDIR - gcc source directory from FSF
#	TARGETDIR - name of the high level directory to make
#
#  Written by Christos Zoulas April 17, 1997 for xntp 3-5.90s
#  Updated by Jonathan Stone Oct 18, 1999    for ntp 4-0.98b

.Sh NAME
.Nm ntpdate
.Nd set the date and time via NTP
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ntpdate
.Op Fl bBdoqsuv
.Op Fl a Ar key
.Op Fl e Ar authdelay
.Op Fl k Ar keyfile
.Op Fl o Ar version
.Op Fl p Ar samples
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Ar server
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets the local date and time by polling the
Network Time Protocol (NTP) server(s) given as the
.Ar server
arguments to determine the correct time. It must be run as root on the
local host. A number of samples are obtained from each of the servers
specified and a subset of the NTP clock filter and selection algorithms
are applied to select the best of these. Note that the accuracy and
reliability of 
.Nm 
depends on the number of servers, the number of polls each time it
is run and the interval between runs.
.Pp
.Nm
can be run manually as necessary to set the host clock, or it can
be run from the host startup script to set the clock at boot time.
This is useful in some cases to set the clock initially before
starting the NTP daemon
.Xr ntpd 8 .
It is also possible
to run 
.Nm
from a 
.Xr cron 8
script. However, it is important to note that
.Nm
with contrived
.Xr cron 8
scripts is no substitute for the NTP daemon, which
uses sophisticated algorithms to maximize accuracy and reliability while
minimizing resource use. Finally, since
.Nm 
does not discipline the host clock frequency as does
.Xr ntpd 8 ,
the accuracy using
.Nm
is limited.
.Pp
Time adjustments are made by
.Nm
in one of two ways.
If 
.Nm
determines the clock is in error more than 0.5
second it will simply step the time by calling the system
.Xr settimeofday 2
routine. If the error is less than 0.5
seconds, it will slew the time by calling the system
.Xr adjtime 2
routine. The latter technique is less disruptive
and more accurate when the error is small, and works quite well when
.Nm
is run by
.Xr cron 8
every hour or two.
.Pp
.Nm 
will decline to set the date if an NTP server
daemon (e.g., 
.Xr ntpd 8 )
is running on the same host. When running 
.Nm
on a regular basis from 
.Xr cron 8
as an alternative to running a daemon, doing so once every hour or two
will result in precise enough timekeeping to avoid stepping the clock.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar key
Enable the authentication function and specify the key identifier to
be used for authentication as the argument
.Ar key
.Nm 
The keys and key identifiers must match
in both the client and server key files. The default is to disable the
authentication function.
.It Fl B
Force the time to always be slewed using the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call,
even if the measured offset is greater than +-128 ms. The default is to
step the time using 
.Xr settimeofday 2
if the offset is greater than +-128
ms. Note that, if the offset is much greater than +-128 ms in this case,
that it can take a long time (hours) to slew the clock to the correct
value. During this time. the host should not be used to synchronize
clients.
.It Fl b
Force the time to be stepped using the
.Xr settimeofday 2
system call,
rather than slewed (default) using the
.Xr adjtime 2
system call. This
option should be used when called from a startup file at boot time.
.It Fl d
Enable the debugging mode, in which
.Nm
will go
through all the steps, but not adjust the local clock. Information
useful for general debugging will also be printed.
.It Fl e Ar authdelay
Specify the processing delay to perform an authentication function
as the value
.Ar authdelay ,
in seconds and fraction (see
.Xr ntpd 8
for details). This number is usually small enough to
be negligible for most purposes, though specifying a value may improve
timekeeping on very slow CPU's.
.It Fl k Ar keyfile
Specify the path for the authentication key file as the string
.Ar keyfile .
The default is 
.Pa /etc/ntp.keys .
This file should be in the format described in
.Xr ntpd 8 .
.It Fl o Ar version
Specify the NTP version for outgoint packets as the integer
.Ar version ,
which can be 1 or 2. The default is 3. This allows
.Nm
to be used with older NTP versions.
.It Fl p Ar samples
Specify the number of samples to be acquired from each server as the
integer
.Ar samples ,
with values from 1 to 8 inclusive. The default is 4.
.It Fl q
Query only - don't set the clock.
.It Fl s
Divert logging output from the standard output (default) to the
system 
.Xr syslog 3
facility. This is designed primarily for convenience of
.Xr cron 8
scripts.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Specify the maximum time waiting for a server response as the value
.Ar timeout ,
in seconds and fraction. The value is is rounded to a
multiple of 0.2 seconds. The default is 1 second, a value suitable for
polling across a LAN.
.It Fl u
Direct 
.Nm
to use an unprivileged port or outgoing
packets. This is most useful when behind a firewall that blocks incoming
traffic to privileged ports, and you want to synchronise with hosts
beyond the firewall. Note that the 
.Fl d
option always uses
unprivileged ports.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.  This option will cause the
.Nm
version
identification string to be logged.

.Sh BUGS
The slew adjustment is actually 50% larger than the measured offset,
since this (it is argued) will tend to keep a badly drifting clock more
accurate. This is probably not a good idea and may cause a troubling
hunt for some values of the kernel variables 
.Xr tick 9
and
.Xr tickadj 9 .

.Nd standard NTP query program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ntpq
.Op Fl inp
.Op Fl c Ar command
.Ar host
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to query NTP servers which implement the
recommended NTP mode 6 control message format about current state and to
request changes in that state. The program may be run either in
interactive mode or controlled using command line arguments. Requests to
read and write arbitrary variables can be assembled, with raw and
pretty-printed output options being available.
.Nm
can also obtain and print a list of peers in a common format by sending
multiple queries to the server.
.Pp
If one or more request options is included on the command line when
.Nm
is executed, each of the requests will be sent to the
NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command line
arguments, or on localhost by default. If no request options are given,
.Nm
will attempt to read commands from the standard input
and execute these on the NTP server running on the first host given on
the command line, again defaulting to localhost when no other host is
specified.
.Nm
will prompt for commands if the standard
input is a terminal device.
.Pp
.Nm
uses NTP mode 6 packets to communicate with the NTP
server, and hence can be used to query any compatable server on the
network which permits it. Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol this
communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over large
distances in terms of network topology. .Nm
makes one
attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if the remote
host is not heard from within a suitable timeout time.
.Pp
Command line options are described following. Specifying a command
line option other than 
.Op Fl i
or
.Op Fl n
will cause the specified query (queries)
to be sent to the indicated host(s) immediately. Otherwise,
.Nm
will attempt to read interactive format commands from
the standard input.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format
command and is added to the list of commands to be 
.Cd cooked .
Variables which are recognized by the server will have their values
reformatted for human consumption. Variables which
.Nm
thinks should have a decodeable value but didn't are marked with a
trailing 
.Cd ? .
.It Cd debug Ar more | less | off
Turns internal query program debugging on and off.
.It Cd delay Ar milliseconds
Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in
requests which require authentication. This is used to enable
(unreliable) server reconfiguration over long delay network paths or
between machines whose clocks are unsynchronized. Actually the server
does not now require timestamps in authenticated requests, so this
command may be obsolete.
.It Cd host Ar hostname
Set the host to which future queries will be sent. Hostname may be
either a host name or a numeric address.
.It Cd hostnames Op yes | no 
If 
.Op yes
is specified, host names are printed in
information displays. If 
.Op no
is specified, numeric
addresses are printed instead. The default is 
.Op yes ,
unless
modified using the command line
.Fl n
switch.
.It Cd keyid Ar keyid
This command allows the specification of a key number to be used to
authenticate configuration requests. This must correspond to a key
number the server has been configured to use for this purpose.
.It Cd ntpversion Ar 1 | 2 | 3
Sets the NTP version number which .Nm
claims in
packets. Defaults to 3, Note that mode 6 control messages (and modes,
for that matter) didn't exist in NTP version 1. There appear to be no
servers left which demand version 1.
.It Cd quit
Exit
.Nm
.It Cd passwd
This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not be
echoed) which will be used to authenticate configuration requests. The
password must correspond to the key configured for use by the NTP server
for this purpose if such requests are to be successful.
.It Cd raw
Causes all output from query commands is printed as received from
the remote server. The only formating/intepretation done on the data is
to transform nonascii data into a printable (but barely understandable)
form.
.It Cd timeout Ar millseconds
Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries. The
default is about 5000 milliseconds. Note that since
.Nm
retries each query once after a timeout, the total waiting time for a
timeout will be twice the timeout value set.
.El
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGE COMMANDS
Each peer known to an NTP server has a 16 bit integer association
identifier assigned to it. NTP control messages which carry peer
variables must identify the peer the values correspond to by including
its association ID. An association ID of 0 is special, and indicates the
variables are system variables, whose names are drawn from a separate
name space.
.Pp
Control message commands result in one or more NTP mode 6 messages
being sent to the server, and cause the data returned to be printed in
some format. Most commands currently implemented send a single message
and expect a single response. The current exceptions are the peers
command, which will send a preprogrammed series of messages to obtain
the data it needs, and the mreadlist and mreadvar commands, which will
iterate over a range of associations.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cd associations
Obtains and prints a list of association identifiers and peer
statuses for in-spec peers of the server being queried. The list is
printed in columns. The first of these is an index numbering the
associations from 1 for internal use, the second the actual association
identifier returned by the server and the third the status word for the
peer. This is followed by a number of columns containing data decoded
from the status word. Note that the data returned by the
.Cd associations
command is cached internally in
.Nm
The index is then of use when dealing with stupid
servers which use association identifiers which are hard for humans to
type, in that for any subsequent commands which require an association
identifier as an argument, the form &amp;index may be used as an
alternative.
.It Cd clockvar Op assocID variable_name =value ...
Requests that a list of the server's clock variables be sent.
Servers which have a radio clock or other external synchronization will
respond positively to this. If the association identifier is omitted or
zero the request is for the variables of the 
.Pa system clock
and will generally get a positive response from all servers with a
clock. If the server treats clocks as pseudo-peers, and hence can
possibly have more than one clock connected at once, referencing the
appropriate peer association ID will show the variables of a particular
clock. Omitting the variable list will cause the server to return a
default variable display.
.It Cd lassocations
Obtains and prints a list of association identifiers and peer
statuses for all associations for which the server is maintaining state.
This command differs from the
.Cd associations
command only
for servers which retain state for out-of-spec client associations
(i.e., fuzzballs). Such associations are normally omitted from the
display when the 
.Cd associations
command is used, but are
included in the output of 
.Cd lassociations .
.It Cd lpassociations
Print data for all associations, including out-of-spec client
associations, from the internally cached list of associations. This
command differs from 
.Cd passociations
only when dealing with fuzzballs.
.It Cd lpeers
Like R peers, except a summary of all associations for which the
server is maintaining state is printed. This can produce a much longer
list of peers from fuzzball servers.
.It Cd mreadlist Ar assocID Ar assocID
.It Cd mrl Ar assocID Ar assocID
Like the 
.Cd readlist
command, except the query is done for
each of a range of (nonzero) association IDs. This range is determined
from the association list cached by the most recent
.Cd associations
command.
.It Cd mreadvar Ar assocID assocID Op variable_name=value ...
.It Cd mrv Ar assocID assocID Op variable_name=value ...
Like the 
.Cd readvar command, except the query is done for
each of a range of (nonzero) association IDs. This range is determined
from the association list cached by the most recent
.Cd associations
command.
.It Cd opeers
An old form of the 
.Cd peers command with the reference ID
replaced by the local interface address.
.It Cd passociations
Prints association data concerning in-spec peers from the internally
cached list of associations. This command performs identically to the
.Cd associations
except that it displays the internally
stored data rather than making a new query.
.It Cd peers
Obtains a list of in-spec peers of the server, along with a summary
of each peer's state. Summary information includes the address of the
remote peer, the reference ID (0.0.0.0 if the refID is unknown), the
stratum of the remote peer, the type of the peer (local, unicast,
multicast or broadcast), when the last packet was received, the polling
interval, in seconds, the reachability register, in octal, and the
current estimated delay, offset and dispersion of the peer, all in
seconds.
.Pp
The character in the left margin indicates the fate of this peer
in the clock selection process. The codes mean:
.Cd "\ "
discarded due
to high stratum and/or failed sanity checks; 
.Cd "x"
designated
falseticker by the intersection algorithm; 
.Cd "."
culled from
the end of the candidate list; 
.Cd "-"
discarded by the clustering algorithm;
.Cd "+"
included in the final selection set; 
.Cd "#"
selected for synchronization but distance exceeds
maximum; 
.Cd "*"
selected for synchronization; and
.Cd "o"
selected for synchronization, PPS signal in use.
.Pp
Note that since the peers command depends on the ability to parse
the values in the responses it gets it may fail to work from time to
time with servers which poorly control the data formats.
.Pp
The contents of the host field may be one of four forms. It may
be a host name, an IP address, a reference clock implementation name
with its parameter or 
.Cd "REFCLK(<implementation number>,<parameter>)" .
On 
.Cd "hostnames no"
only IP-addresses will be displayed.
.It Cd pstatus Ar assocID
Sends a read status request to the server for the given association.
The names and values of the peer variables returned will be printed.
Note that the status word from the header is displayed preceding the
variables, both in hexidecimal and in pidgeon English.
.It Cd readlist Op assocID
.It Cd rl Op assocID
Requests that the values of the variables in the internal variable
list be returned by the server. If the association ID is omitted or is 0
the variables are assumed to be system variables. Otherwise they are
treated as peer variables. If the internal variable list is empty a
request is sent without data, which should induce the remote server to
return a default display.
.It Cd readvar Ar assocID Op variable_name=value ...
.It Cd rv Ar assocID Op variable_name=value ...
Requests that the values of the specified variables be returned by
the server by sending a read variables request. If the association ID is
omitted or is given as zero the variables are system variables,
otherwise they are peer variables and the values returned will be those
of the corresponding peer. Omitting the variable list will send a
request with no data which should induce the server to return a default
display.
.It Cd writevar Ar assocID Op variable_name=value ...
Like the readvar request, except the specified variables are written
instead of read.
.It Cd writelist Op assocID
Like the readlist request, except the internal list variables are
written instead of read.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The peers command is non-atomic and may occasionally result in
spurious error messages about invalid associations occurring and
terminating the command. The timeout time is a fixed constant, which
means you wait a long time for timeouts since it assumes sort of a worst
case. The program should improve the timeout estimate as it sends
queries to a particular host, but doesn't.

.Nd trace a chain of NTP servers back to the primary
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl vdn
.Op Fl r Ar retries
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Ar server
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
determines where a given Network Time Protocol
(NTP) server gets its time from, and follows the chain of NTP servers
back to their master time source. If given no arguments, it starts with
.Pa localhost
Here is an example of the output from
.Nm 
.nf
% ntptrace
localhost: stratum 4, offset 0.0019529, synch distance 0.144135
server2ozo.com: stratum 2, offset 0.0124263, synch distance 0.115784
usndh.edu: stratum 1, offset 0.00192, synch distance 0.011, refid 'WWVB'
.fi
.Pp
On each line, the fields are (left to right): the host name, the host
stratum, the time offset between that host and the local host (as
measured by 
.Nm 
this is why it is not always zero for
.Pa localhost, 
the host synchronization distance, and (only
for stratum-1 servers) the reference clock ID. All times are given in
seconds. Note that the stratum is the server hop count to the primary
source, while the synchronization distance is the estimated error
relative to the primary source. These terms are precisely defined in
RFC-1305.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Turns on some debugging output.
.It Fl n
Turns off the printing of host names; instead, host IP addresses are
given. This may be useful if a nameserver is down.
.It Fl r Ar retries
Sets the number of retransmission attempts for each host (default = 5).
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Sets the retransmission timeout (in seconds) (default = 2).
.It Fl v
Prints verbose information about the NTP servers.
.Sh BUGS
This program makes no attempt to improve accuracy by doing multiple
samples.

.Op Fl p Ar pidfile
.Op Fl r Ar broadcastdelay

.Op Fl V Ar variable
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an operating system daemon which sets and
maintains the system time-of-day in synchronism with Internet
standard time servers.
.Nm
is a complete
implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 3, as
defined by RFC-1305, but also retains compatibility with version 1
and 2 servers as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119,
respectively.
.Nm
does all computations in 64-bit
fixed point arithmetic and requires no floating point
support. While the ultimate precision of this design, about 232
picoseconds, is not achievable with ordinary workstations and
networks of today, it may be required with future nanosecond CPU
clocks and gigabit LANs.
.Pp
The daemon can operate in any of several modes, including
symmetric active/passive, client/server and broadcast/multicast,
as described in RFC-1305. A broadcast/multicast client can
discover remote servers, compute server-client propagation delay
correction factors and configure itself automatically. This makes
it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without specifying
configuration details specific to the local environment.
.Pp
Ordinarily,
.Nm
reads the
.Pa ntp.conf
configuration file at startup time in order to determine the
synchronization sources and operating modes. It is also possible
to specify a working, although limited, configuration entirely on
the command line, obviating the need for a configuration
file. This may be particularly appropriate when the local host is
to be configured as a broadcast or multicast client, with all
peers being determined by listening to broadcasts at run time.
.Pp
Various internal
.Nm
variables can be displayed
and configuration options altered while the daemon is running
using the
.Xr ntpq 8
and
.Xr ntpdc 8
utility programs.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts it looks at the value of
.Pa umask ,
and if it's zero
.Nm
will set
.Pa umask
to
.Pa 022 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Enable authentication mode. The default is enabled, so this option
is obsolete now.
.It Fl A
Disable authentication mode.
.It Fl b
Synchronize using NTP broadcast messages.
.It Fl c Ar conffile
Specify the name and path of the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Specify debugging mode. This flag may occur multiple times, with
each occurrence indicating greater detail of display.
.It Fl f Ar driftfile
Specify the name and path of the drift file.
.It Fl k Ar keyfile
Specify the name and path of the file containing the NTP
authentication keys.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
Specify the name and path of the log file. The default is the system
log facility.
.It Fl m
Synchronize using NTP multicast messages on the IP multicast group
address 224.0.1.1 (requires multicast kernel).
.It Fl p Ar pidfile
Specify the name and path to record the daemon's process ID.
.It Fl r Ar broadcastdelay
Specify the default propagation delay from the broadcast/multicast
server and this computer. This is used only if the delay cannot be
computed automatically by the protocol.
.It Fl s Ar statsdir
Specify the directory path for files created by the statistics
facility.
.It Fl t Ar key
Add a key number to the trusted key list.
.It Fl v Ar variable
Add a system variable.
.It Fl V Ar variable
Add a system variable listed by default.
.El
.Pp
.Sh THE CONFIGURATION FILE
The
.Nm
configuration file is read at initial startup
in order to specify the synchronization sources, modes and other related
information. Usually, it is installed in the
.Pa /etc
directory, but could be installed elsewhere (see the
.Fl -c Ar conffile
command line option). The file format is similar
to other Unix configuration files - comments begin with a
.Pa #
character and extend to the end of the line; blank lines are ignored.
Configuration commands consist of an initial keyword followed by a list
of arguments, some of which may be optional, separated by whitespace.
Commands may not be continued over multiple lines. Arguments may be host
names, host addresses written in numeric, dotted-quad form, integers,
floating point numbers (when specifying times in seconds) and text
strings. Optional arguments are delimited by
.Pa [ ]
in the
following descriptions, while alternatives are separated by
.Pa | .
The notation [ ... ] means an optional, indefinite
repetition of the last item before the [ ... ].
.Pp
See the following pages for configuration and control options. While
there is a rich set of options available, the only required option is
one or more
.Pa server, peer
or
.Pa broadcast
commands
described in the
.Pa Configuration Options
page. The
.Pa Notes on Configuring NTP and Setting up a NTP Subnet
page contains
an extended discussion of these options.

consume the space were designed more with a busy primary server, rather
than a high stratum workstation, in mind.

.Nd special NTP query program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Op Fl ilnps
.Op Fl c Ar command
.Oo

.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to query the
.Xr ntpd 8
daemon
about its current state and to request changes in that state. The
program may be run either in interactive mode or controlled using
command line arguments. Extensive state and statistics information is
available through the
.Nm
interface. In addition, nearly
all the configuration options which can be specified at start up using
ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run time using
.Nm
.Pp
If one or more request options is included on the command line when
.Nm
is executed, each of the requests will be sent to
the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command line
arguments, or on localhost by default. If no request options are given,
.Nm
will attempt to read commands from the standard
input and execute these on the NTP server running on the first host
given on the command line, again defaulting to localhost when no other
host is specified.
.Nm
will prompt for commands if the
standard input is a terminal device.
.Pp
.Nm
uses NTP mode 7 packets to communicate with the
NTP server, and hence can be used to query any compatable server on the
network which permits it. Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol this
communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over large
distances in terms of network topology.
.Nm
makes no
attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if the remote
host is not heard from within a suitable timeout time.
.Pp
The operation of
.Nm
are specific to the particular
implementation of the
.Xr ntpd 8
daemon and can be expected to
work only with this and maybe some previous versions of the daemon.
Requests from a remote
.Nm
program which affect the
state of the local server must be authenticated, which requires both the
remote program and local server share a common key and key identifier.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
Specifying a command line option other than
.Fl i
or
.Fl n
will cause the specified query (queries) to be sent to
the indicated host(s) immediately. Otherwise,
.Nm
will
attempt to read interactive format commands from the standard input.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar command
The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format
command and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the
specified host(s). Multiple 
.Fl c
options may be given.
.It Fl i
Force
.Nm
to operate in interactive mode. Prompts
will be written to the standard output and commands read from the
standard input.
.It Fl l
Obtain a list of peers which are known to the server(s). This switch
is equivalent to
.Fl c Ar listpeers .
.It Fl n
Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than
converting to the canonical host names.
.It Fl p
Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary
of their state. This is equivalent to 
.Fl c Ar peers .
.It Fl s
Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary
of their state, but in a slightly different format than the
.Fl p
switch.
This is equivalent to
.Fl c Ar dmpeers .
.El
.Pp
.Sh INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero to
four arguments. Only enough characters of the full keyword to uniquely
identify the command need be typed. The output of a command is normally
sent to the standard output, but optionally the output of individual
commands may be sent to a file by appending a
.\" XXX I don't think this is right, but it's what the HTML said... --thorpej
.Pa < ,
followed by a file name, to the command line.
.Pp
A number of interactive format commands are executed entirely within
the
.Nm
program itself and do not result in NTP mode 7
requests being sent to a server. These are described following.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It ? Op Ar command_keyword
.It help Op Ar command_keyword
A
.Pa ?
by itself will print a list of all the command
keywords known to this incarnation of
.Xr ntpq 8 .
A
.Pa ?
followed by a command keyword will print funcation and
usage information about the command. This command is probably a better
source of information about
.Nm ntpq
than this manual page.
.It delay Ar milliseconds
Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in
requests which require authentication. This is used to enable
(unreliable) server reconfiguration over long delay network paths or
between machines whose clocks are unsynchronized. Actually the server
does not now require timestamps in authenticated requests, so this
command may be obsolete.
.It host Ar hostname
Set the host to which future queries will be sent. Hostname may be
either a host name or a numeric address.
.It hostname Op Ar yes | no
If
.Ar yes
is specified, host names are printed in
information displays. If
.Ar no
is specified, numeric addresses
are printed instead. The default is
.Ar yes ,
unless modified
using the command line
.Fl n
switch.
.It keyid Ar keyid
This command allows the specification of a key number to be used to
authenticate configuration requests. This must correspond to a key
number the server has been configured to use for this purpose.
.It quit
Exit
.Nm
.It passwd
This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not be
echoed) which will be used to authenticate configuration requests. The
password must correspond to the key configured for use by the NTP server
for this purpose if such requests are to be successful.
.It timeout Ar milliseconds
Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries. The
default is about 8000 milliseconds. Note that since
.Nm
retries each query once after a timeout, the total waiting time for a
timeout will be twice the timeout value set.
.El
.Pp
.Sh CONTROL MESSAGE COMMANDS
Query commands result in NTP mode 7 packets containing requests for
information being sent to the server. These are read-only commands in
that they make no modification of the server configuration state.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It listpeers
Obtains and prints a brief list of the peers for which the server is
maintaining state. These should include all configured peer associations
as well as those peers whose stratum is such that they are considered by
the server to be possible future synchonization candidates.
.It peers
Obtains a list of peers for which the server is maintaining state,
along with a summary of that state. Summary information includes the
address of the remote peer, the local interface address (0.0.0.0 if a
local address has yet to be determined), the stratum of the remote peer
(a stratum of 16 indicates the remote peer is unsynchronized), the
polling interval, in seconds, the reachability register, in octal, and
the current estimated delay, offset and dispersion of the peer, all in
seconds. In addition, the character in the left margin indicates the
mode this peer entry is operating in. A
.Pa +
denotes symmetric
active, a
.Pa -
indicates symmetric passive, a
.Pa =
means the remote server is being polled in client mode, a
.Pa ^
indicates that the server is broadcasting to this address, a
.Pa ~
denotes that the remote peer is sending broadcasts and a
.Pa *
marks the peer the server is currently synchonizing to.
.Pp
The contents of the host field may be one of four forms. It may be a
host name, an IP address, a reference clock implementation name with its
parameter or
.Pa REFCLK(implementation number, parameter) .
On
.Pa hostnames no
only IP-addresses
will be displayed.
.It dmpeers
A slightly different peer summary list. Identical to the output of
the
.Pa peers
command, except for the character in the leftmost
column. Characters only appear beside peers which were included in the
final stage of the clock selection algorithm. A
.Pa .
indicates
that this peer was cast off in the falseticker detection, while a
.Pa +
indicates that the peer made it through. A
.Pa *
denotes the peer the server is currently synchronizing with.
.It showpeer Ar peer_address Op Ar ...
Shows a detailed display of the current peer variables for one or
more peers. Most of these values are described in the NTP Version 2
specification.
.It pstats Ar peer_address Op Ar ...
Show per-peer statistic counters associated with the specified
peer(s).
.It clockinfo clock_peer_address Op Ar ...
Obtain and print information concerning a peer clock. The values
obtained provide information on the setting of fudge factors and other
clock performance information.
.It kerninfo
Obtain and print kernel phase-lock loop operating parameters. This
information is available only if the kernel has been specially modified
for a precision timekeeping function.
.It loopinfo Op Ar oneline | multiline
Print the values of selected loop filter variables. The loop filter
is the part of NTP which deals with adjusting the local system clock.
The
.Pa offset
is the last offset given to the loop filter by
the packet processing code. The
.Pa frequency
is the frequency
error of the local clock in parts-per-million (ppm). The
.Pa time_const
controls the stiffness of the phase-lock loop
and thus the speed at which it can adapt to oscillator drift. The
.Pa watchdog timer
value is the number of seconds which have
elapsed since the last sample offset was given to the loop filter. The
.Ar oneline
and
.Ar multiline
options specify the
format in which this information is to be printed, with
.Ar multiline
as the default.
.It sysinfo
Print a variety of system state variables, i.e., state related to
the local server. All except the last four lines are described in the
NTP Version 3 specification, RFC-1305.
.Pp
The
.Pa system flags
show various system flags, some of
which can be set and cleared by the
.Pa enable
and
.Pa disable
configuration commands, respectively. These are the
.Pa auth ,
.Pa bclient ,
.Pa monitor ,
.Pa pll ,
.Pa pps
and
.Pa stats
flags. See the
.Xr ntpd 8
documentation for the meaning of these flags. There
are two additional flags which are read only, the
.Pa kernel_pll
and
.Pa kernel_pps .
These flags
indicate the synchronization status when the precision time kernel
modifications are in use. The
.Pa kernel_pll
indicates that the
local clock is being disciplined by the kernel, while the kernel_pps
indicates the kernel discipline is provided by the PPS signal.
.Pp
The
.Pa stability
is the residual frequency error
remaining after the system frequency correction is applied and is
intended for maintenance and debugging. In most architectures, this
value will initially decrease from as high as 500 ppm to a nominal value
in the range .01 to 0.1 ppm. If it remains high for some time after
starting the daemon, something may be wrong with the local clock, or the
value of the kernel variable
.Pa tick
may be incorrect.
.Pp
The
.Pa broadcastdelay
shows the default broadcast
delay, as set by the
.Pa broadcastdelay
configuration command.
.Pp
The
.Pa authdelay
shows the default authentication
delay, as set by the
.Pa authdelay
configuration command.
.Pp
.It sysstats
Print statistics counters maintained in the protocol module.
.It memstats
Print statistics counters related to memory allocation code.
.It iostats
Print statistics counters maintained in the input-output module.
.It timerstats
Print statistics counters maintained in the timer/event queue
support code.
.It reslist
Obtain and print the server's restriction list. This list is
(usually) printed in sorted order and may help to understand how the
restrictions are applied.
.It monlist Op Ar version
Obtain and print traffic counts collected and maintained by the
monitor facility. The version number should not normally need to be
specified.
.It clkbug Ar clock_peer_address Op Ar ...
Obtain debugging information for a reference clock driver. This
information is provided only by some clock drivers and is mostly
undecodable without a copy of the driver source in hand.

.Sh RUNTIME CONFIGURATION REQUESTS
All requests which cause state changes in the server are
authenticated by the server using a configured NTP key (the facility can
also be disabled by the server by not configuring a key). The key number
and the corresponding key must also be made known to
.Nm xtnpdc .
This can be
done using the
.Pa keyid
and
.Pa passwd
commands, the latter of which will
prompt at the terminal for a password to use as the encryption key. You
will also be prompted automatically for both the key number and password
the first time a command which would result in an authenticated request
to the server is given. Authentication not only provides verification
that the requester has permission to make such changes, but also gives
an extra degree of protection again transmission errors.
.Pp
Authenticated requests always include a timestamp in the packet data,
which is included in the computation of the authentication code. This
timestamp is compared by the server to its receive time stamp. If they
differ by more than a small amount the request is rejected. This is done
for two reasons. First, it makes simple replay attacks on the server, by
someone who might be able to overhear traffic on your LAN, much more
difficult. Second, it makes it more difficult to request configuration
changes to your server from topologically remote hosts. While the
reconfiguration facility will work well with a server on the local host,
and may work adequately between time-synchronized hosts on the same LAN,
it will work very poorly for more distant hosts. As such, if reasonable
passwords are chosen, care is taken in the distribution and protection
of keys and appropriate source address restrictions are applied, the run
time reconfiguration facility should provide an adequate level of
security.
.Pp
The following commands all make authenticated requests.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It addpeer Ar peer_address Op keyid version prefer
Add a configured peer association at the given address and operating
in symmetric active mode. Note that an existing association with the
same peer may be deleted when this command is executed, or may simply be
converted to conform to the new configuration, as appropriate. If the
optional
.Ar keyid
is a nonzero integer, all outgoing packets
to the remote server will have an authentication field attached
encrypted with this key. If the value is 0 (or not given) no
authentication will be done. The
.Ar version
can be 1, 2 or 3
and defaults to 3. The
.Ar prefer
keyword indicates a preferred
peer (and thus will be used primarily for clock synchronisation if
possible). The preferred peer also determines the validity of the PPS
signal - if the preferred peer is suitable for synchronisation so is the
PPS signal.
.It addserver Ar peer_address Op keyid version prefer
Identical to the
.Pa addpeer
command, except that the operating mode is
client.
.It broadcast Ar peer_address keyid version prefer
Identical to the addpeer command, except that the operating mode is
broadcast. In this case a valid key identifier and key are required. The
.Ar peer_address
parameter can be the broadcast address of the
local network or a multicast group address assigned to NTP. If a
multicast address, a multicast-capable kernel is required.
.It unconfig Ar peer_address Op Ar ...
This command causes the configured bit to be removed from the
specified peer(s). In many cases this will cause the peer association to
be deleted. When appropriate, however, the association may persist in an
unconfigured mode if the remote peer is willing to continue on in this
fashion.
.It fudge Ar peer_address Op time1 time2 stratum refid
This command provides a way to set certain data for a reference
clock. See the source listing for further information.
.It enable Op flag ... 
.It disable Op Ar flag Op Ar ...
These commands operate in the same way as the
.Pa enable
and
.Pa disable
configuration file commands of
.Xr ntpd 8 .
Following is a description of the flags. Note that
only the
.Pa auth ,
.Pa bclient ,
.Pa monitor ,
.Pa pll ,
.Pa pps
and
.Pa stats
flags can be
set by
.Nm
the
.Pa pll_kernel
and
.Pa pps_kernel
flags are read-only.
.Pp
.Pa auth
Enables the server to synchronize with unconfigured peers only if
the peer has been correctly authenticated using a trusted key and key
identifier. The default for this flag is enable.
.Pp
.Pa bclient
Enables the server to listen for a message from a broadcast or
multicast server, as in the
.Pa multicastclient
command with
default address. The default for this flag is disable.
.Pp
.Pa monitor
Enables the monitoring facility. See the
.Xr ntpdc 8
program
and the
.Pa monlist
command or further information. The default
for this flag is enable.
.Pp
.Pa pll
Enables the server to adjust its local clock by means of NTP. If
disabled, the local clock free-runs at its intrinsic time and frequency
offset. This flag is useful in case the local clock is controlled by
some other device or protocol and NTP is used only to provide
synchronization to other clients. In this case, the local clock driver
is used. See the
.Pa Reference Clock Drivers
page for further information. The default for this flag is enable.
.Pp
.Pa pps
Enables the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal when frequency and time is
disciplined by the precision time kernel modifications. See the
.Pa A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping
page for
further information. The default for this flag is disable.
.Pp
.Pa stats
Enables the statistics facility. See the
.Pa Monitoring Options
page for further information. The default for this flag is enable.
.Pp
.Pa pll_kernel
When the precision time kernel modifications are installed, this
indicates the kernel controls the clock discipline; otherwise, the
daemon controls the clock discipline.
.Pp
.Pa pps_kernel
When the precision time kernel modifications are installed and a
pulse-per-second (PPS) signal is available, this indicates the PPS
signal controls the clock discipline; otherwise, the daemon or kernel
controls the clock discipline, as indicated by the
.Pa pll_kernel
flag.
.It restrict Ar address mask flag Op Ar flag
This command operates in the same way as the
.Pa restrict
configuration file commands of
.Xr ntpd 8 .
.It unrestrict Ar address mask flag Op Ar flag
Unrestrict the matching entry from the restrict list.
.It delrestrict Ar address mask Op Ar ntpport
Delete the matching entry from the restrict list.
.It readkeys
Causes the current set of authentication keys to be purged and a new
set to be obtained by rereading the keys file (which must have been
specified in the
.Xr ntpd 8
configuration file). This allows
encryption keys to be changed without restarting the server.
.It trustkey Ar keyid Op Ar ...
.It untrustkey Ar keyid Op Ar ...
These commands operate in the same way as the
.Pa trustedkey
and
.Pa untrustkey
configuration file
commands of
.Xr ntpd 8 .
.It authinfo
Returns information concerning the authentication module, including
known keys and counts of encryptions and decryptions which have been
done.
.It traps
Display the traps set in the server. See the source listing for
further information.
.It addtrap Op Ar address Op port interface
Set a trap for asynchronous messages. See the source listing for
further information.
.It clrtrap Op Ar address Op port interface
Clear a trap for asynchronous messages. See the source listing for
further information.
.It reset
Clear the statistics counters in various modules of the server. See
the source listing for further information.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is a crude hack. Much of the information it shows
is deadly boring and could only be loved by its implementer. The program
was designed so that new (and temporary) features were easy to hack in,
at great expense to the program's ease of use. Despite this, the program
is occasionally useful.
