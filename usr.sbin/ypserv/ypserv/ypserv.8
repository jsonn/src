.Nm ypserv
.Nd YP server daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a Ar aclfile
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl x
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a fundamental part of the network information system called
.Tn YP .
This server provides information from
.Tn YP
maps to the
.Tn YP
clients on the network.
.Pp
A
.Tn YP
map is stored on the server as a
.Xr db 3
database. A number of
.Tn YP
maps is grouped together in a domain.
.Nm
determines the domains it serves by looking for a directory with
the domain name in 
.Ar /var/yp .
.Pp
.Tn YP
hasn't been known for high security through the years. In recent years
security has improved by restricting access to the server. In SunOS 4.1
has a new file occured named
.Ar /var/yp/securenet .
It contains networks the server can assume is secure. For information about
file format see
.Xr securenet 5 .
.Pp
Before the author of this server had seen 
.Xr securenet 5
another format was implemented
.Xr ypserv.acl 5 .
This file format makes it possible to allow and deny hosts and networks
access to the server. This file can have any name since it's given by
the argument to
.Fl a 
(use full path). 
.Pp
The file used can be reread by sending a SIGHUP to
.Nm "" .
The process pid
can be found in the file
.Pa /var/run/ypserv.pid .
.Pp
If a host isn't secure all queries to the server will result in a YP_NODOM
result.
.Pp
If the file
.Pa /var/yp/ypserv.log
exists then messages will be written to the file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar aclfile
Don't use 
.Ar /var/yp/securenet .
Use another file with another file format. For further information see
.Xr ypserv.acl 5 .
.It Fl d
Use internet Domain Name System. If a query to map
.Pa hosts.byname
or
.Pa hosts.byaddr
fails, make a DNS query and return the result if successful.
.It Fl x
Terminate the server after processing
.Ar aclfile
or
.Ar /var/yp/securenet .
