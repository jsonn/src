.Sh NAME
.Nm ypserv.acl
.Nd 
.Xr ypserv 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
file controls which hosts can connect to the
.Tn YP
server.
.Pp
The format is more complex than the format for
.Xr securenet 5 .
The first two verbs on each line controls if the line will
.Em allow
or
.Em deny
access for a
.Em host ,
network
.Em (net)
or
.Em all
hosts.
.Pp
The
.Tn YP
server reads the configuration file and build a list in memory.
This list is processed from the beginning for every incomming request.
As soon a match is found in the list the search terminates and it
returns success or failure depending on 
.Em allow
or 
.Em deny .
If no match was found in the list success is returned.
.Pp
If access is denied every call will cause a 
.Dq no such domain
error for the caller.
.Pp
There is no default name for this file. Start 
.Nm ypserv
with a
.Fl a Ar filename
to read a file with this format.
.Pp
The following different syntax can be used:
.Pp
.Aq Em allow|deny
.Em host
.Aq Em hostname|ip-address
.Pp
If 
.Em hostname
has more than one ip address then all will be added to the list.
.Pp
.Aq Em allow|deny
.Em net
.Aq Em netname|netnumber
.Op Em netmask Aq netname|netnumber
.Pp
If the
.Em netmask
part of the command isn't given then the netmask will be assumed to be a
class A, B or C net depending on the net number.
.Pp
.Aq Em allow|deny 
.Em all
.Pp
A line containing one of these commands will always match any host.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
A configuration file might appear as follows:
.Bd -literal
# This is an example of an access control file to be used by ypserv.
#
# This file is parsed line by line. First match will terminate the check
# of the caller.
#

###########################################################################
# This is the commands that will match a single host
#
#	allow host <hostname|ip-address>
#	deny host <hostname|ip-address>
#
# To process hostname gethostbyname is called. If the hostname has
# multiple ip-addresses all will be added (I hope). ip-address
# processed by inet_aton.
deny host jodie

###########################################################################
# This is the commands that will match a network
#
#	allow net <netname|netnumber> [netmask <netname|netnumber>]
#	deny net <netname|netnumber> [netmask <netname|netnumber>]
#
# To process netname getnetbyname is called, and inet_aton is used for
# netnumber. inet_aton both access numbers as 255.255.255.0 and 0xffffff00.
#
# If netmask isn't given the parser will assume netmask from the first bits
# of the network number. So if the network is subneted the you have to add
# the netmask. In my case I've got the network 139.58.253.0 at home so too
# allow any of my computers to talk with the server I need the following
# line
#
allow net mojathome netmask 255.255.255.0

###########################################################################
# At last we have a command that will match any caller:
#
#	allow all 
#	deny all
#

# reject all connections
deny all
