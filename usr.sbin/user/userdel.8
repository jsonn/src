.Sh NAME
.Nm userdel
.Nd remove a user from the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ""
.Op Fl D
.Op Fl p Ar preserve-value
.Nm ""
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl v
user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility removes a user from the system, optionally
removing that user's home diretory and any subdirectories.
.Pp
The first format of the command shown above (utilising the -D option)
sets and displays the defaults for the
.Nm
utility.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
without any further options, -D will show the current defaults which
will be used by the
.Nm
utility. Together with one of the options shown for the first version
of the command, -D will set the default to be the new value.
.It Fl p Ar preserve-value
sets the preservation value. If this value is one of "true", "false",
or a non-zero number, then the user login information will be preserved.
.El
.Pp
The following command line options are recognised:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p
preserve the user information in the password file,
but do not allow the user to login, by switching the
password to an "impossible" one, and by setting the
user's shell the the false(1) program.
This option can be helpful in preserving a user's
files for later use by members of that person's
group after the user has moved on.
This value can also be set in the
/etc/usermgmt.conf
file, using the "preserve" field. If the field
has any of the values "true", "yes", or a non-zero number,
then user information preservation will take place.
.It Fl r
remove the user's home directory, any subdirectories,
and any files and other entries in them.
.It Fl v
perform any actions in a verbose manner.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
It is based on the
.Ar addnerd
package by the same author.

.Nm
utility was written by Alistair G. Crooks (agc@netbsd.org).
