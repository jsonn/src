.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl mov
.Op Fl G Ar secondary-group
.Op Fl c Ar comment
.Op Fl d Ar home-dir
.Op Fl e Ar expiry-time
.Op Fl f Ar inactive-time
.Oo
.Fl g Ar gid | name | Li =uid

.Op Fl L Ar login-class
.Op Fl l Ar new-login
.Op Fl p Ar password
.Op Fl s Ar shell
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility modifies user login information on the system.
.Pp
Default values are taken from the information provided in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file, which, if running as root, is created using the built-in defaults if
it does not exist.
.Pp
After setting any defaults, and then reading values from
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf ,
the following command line options are processed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl G Ar secondary-group
is the secondary group to which the user will be added in the
.Pa /etc/group
file.
.It Fl c Ar comment
is the comment field (also, for historical reasons known as the
GECOS field) which will be added for the user, and typically will include
the username, and, perhaps, contact information for the user.
.It Fl d Ar home-directory
Sets the home directory to
.Ar home-directory
without populating it; if the
.Fl m
option is specified, tries to move the old home directory to
.Ar home-directory .
.It Fl e Ar expiry-time
sets the time at which the current password expires.  This can be used
to implement password aging.  It should be entered in the form
.Dq month day year ,
where month is the month name (the first three characters are
sufficient), day is the day of the month, and year is the year.
Time in seconds since the epoch (UTC) is also valid.  A value of
0 can be used to disable this feature.
This value can be preset for all users using the
.Ar expire
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl f Ar inactive-time
sets the time at which the account expires.
See the
.Fl e
option.
.It Xo
.Fl g Ar gid | name | Li =uid
.Xc
gives the group name or identifier to be used for the user's primary group.
If this is
.Ql =uid ,
then a uid and gid will be picked which are both unique
and the same, and a line added to
.Pa /etc/group
to describe the new group.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar gid
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl L Ar login-class
This option sets the login class for the user.  See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information on user login classes. This value can be preset
for all users by using the
.Ar class
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl l Ar new-user
gives the new user name.
It must consist of alphanumeric characters, or the characters
.Ql \&. ,
.Ql \&-
or
.Ql \&_ .
.It Fl m
moves the home directory from its old position to the new one.
If
.Fl d
is not specified, the
.Ar new-user
argument of the
.Fl l
option is used; one of
.Fl d
and
.Fl l
is needed.
.It Fl o
allows duplicate uids to be given.
.It Fl p Ar password
specifies an already-encrypted password for the user.
This password can then be changed by using the
.Xr chpass 1
utility.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar password
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl s Ar shell
specifies the login shell for the user.
This value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar shell
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl u Ar uid
specifies a new uid for the user.
Boundaries for this value can be preset for all users
by using the
.Ar range
field in the
.Pa /etc/usermgmt.conf
file.
See
.Xr usermgmt.conf 5
for more details.
.It Fl v
enables verbose mode - explain the commands as they are executed.
.El
.Pp
Once the information has been verified,
.Nm
uses
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8
to update the user database.  This is run in the background, and,
at very large sites could take several minutes.  Until this update
is completed, the password file is unavailable for other updates
and the new information is not available to programs.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and \*[Gt]0 if an error occurs.
