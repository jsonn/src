.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsd
.Nd remote
.Tn NFS
server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 6rut
.Op Fl n Ar num_servers
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs on a server machine to service
.Tn NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.Nm
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
.Pp
Unless otherwise specified, four servers for
.Tn UDP
transport are started.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r
Register the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr rpcbind 8
without creating any servers.
This option can be used along with the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.
.It Fl n
Specifies how many servers to create.
.It Fl 6
Listen to IPv6 requests as well as IPv4 requests. If IPv6 support is not
available, nfsd will silently continue and just use IPv4.
.It Fl t
Serve
.Tn TCP NFS
clients.
.It Fl u
Serve
.Tn UDP NFS
clients.
.El
.Pp
For example, 
.Dq Li "nfsd -t -u -n 6"
serves
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports using six daemons.
.Pp
A server should run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six. The maximum number of daemon is 20, the default is 4.
If the number of servers on the command line exeeds 20, it is reset to
the default.
.Pp
.Nm
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094 and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

.Nm
utility first appeared in
