 * This client was substantially modified and enhanced by Elliot Poger
 * for use on Linux while he was working on the MosquitoNet project at
 * Stanford.
 *
 * The current version owes much to Elliot's Linux enhancements, but
 * was substantially reorganized and partially rewritten by Ted Lemon
 * so as to use the same networking framework that the Internet Software
 * Consortium DHCP server uses.   Much system-specific configuration code
 * was moved into a shell script so that as support for more operating
 * systems is added, it will not be necessary to port and maintain
 * system-specific configuration code to these operating systems - instead,
 * the shell script can invoke the native tools to accomplish the same
 * purpose.

 * In addition, there are several relevant per-lease variables.
