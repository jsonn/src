/* This file is kind of a crutch for the BIND 8 nsupdate code, which has
 * itself been cruelly hacked from its original state.   What this code
 * does is twofold: first, it maintains a database of zone cuts that can
 * be used to figure out which server should be contacted to update any
 * given domain name.   Secondly, it maintains a set of named TSIG keys,
 * and associates those keys with zones.   When an update is requested for
 * a particular zone, the key associated with that zone is used for the
 * update.
 *
 * The way this works is that you define the domain name to which an
 * SOA corresponds, and the addresses of some primaries for that domain name:
 *
 *	zone FOO.COM {
 *	  primary 10.0.17.1;
 *	  secondary 10.0.22.1, 10.0.23.1;
 *	  key "FOO.COM Key";
 * 	}
 *
 * If an update is requested for GAZANGA.TOPANGA.FOO.COM, then the name
 * server looks in its database for a zone record for "GAZANGA.TOPANGA.FOO.COM",
 * doesn't find it, looks for one for "TOPANGA.FOO.COM", doesn't find *that*,
 * looks for "FOO.COM", finds it. So it
 * attempts the update to the primary for FOO.COM.   If that times out, it
 * tries the secondaries.   You can list multiple primaries if you have some
 * kind of magic name server that supports that.   You shouldn't list
 * secondaries that don't know how to forward updates (e.g., BIND 8 doesn't
 * support update forwarding, AFAIK).   If no TSIG key is listed, the update
 * is attempted without TSIG.
 *
 * The DHCP server tries to find an existing zone for any given name by
 * trying to look up a local zone structure for each domain containing
 * that name, all the way up to '.'.   If it finds one cached, it tries
 * to use that one to do the update.   That's why it tries to update
 * "FOO.COM" above, even though theoretically it should try GAZANGA...
 * and TOPANGA... first.
 *
 * If the update fails with a predefined or cached zone (we'll get to
 * those in a second), then it tries to find a more specific zone.   This
 * is done by looking first for an SOA for GAZANGA.TOPANGA.FOO.COM.   Then
 * an SOA for TOPANGA.FOO.COM is sought.   If during this search a predefined
 * or cached zone is found, the update fails - there's something wrong
 * somewhere.
 *
 * If a more specific zone _is_ found, that zone is cached for the length of
 * its TTL in the same database as that described above.   TSIG updates are
 * never done for cached zones - if you want TSIG updates you _must_
 * write a zone definition linking the key to the zone.   In cases where you
 * know for sure what the key is but do not want to hardcode the IP addresses
 * of the primary or secondaries, a zone declaration can be made that doesn't
 * include any primary or secondary declarations.   When the DHCP server
 * encounters this while hunting up a matching zone for a name, it looks up
 * the SOA, fills in the IP addresses, and uses that record for the update.
 * If the SOA lookup returns NXRRSET, a warning is printed and the zone is
 * discarded, TSIG key and all.   The search for the zone then continues as if
 * the zone record hadn't been found.   Zones without IP addresses don't
 * match when initially hunting for a predefined or cached zone to update.
 *
 * When an update is attempted and no predefined or cached zone is found
 * that matches any enclosing domain of the domain being updated, the DHCP
 * server goes through the same process that is done when the update to a
 * predefined or cached zone fails - starting with the most specific domain
 * name (GAZANGA.TOPANGA.FOO.COM) and moving to the least specific (the root),
 * it tries to look up an SOA record.   When it finds one, it creates a cached
 * zone and attempts an update, and gives up if the update fails.
 *
 * TSIG keys are defined like this:
 *
 *	key "FOO.COM Key" {
 *		algorithm HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT;
 *		secret <Base64>;
 *	}
 *
 * <Base64> is a number expressed in base64 that represents the key.
 * It's also permissible to use a quoted string here - this will be
 * translated as the ASCII bytes making up the string, and will not
 * include any NUL termination.  The key name can be any text string,
 * and the key type must be one of the key types defined in the draft
 * or by the IANA.  Currently only the HMAC-MD5... key type is
 * supported.
