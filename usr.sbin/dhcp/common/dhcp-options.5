.SH NAME
dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol allows the client to receive
.B options
from the DHCP server describing the network configuration and various
services that are available on the network.   When configuring
.B dhcpd(8)
or
.B dhclient(8) ,
options must often be declared.   The syntax for declaring options,
and the names and formats of the options that can be declared, are
documented here.
.SH REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS
.PP
DHCP \fIoption\fR statements always start with the \fIoption\fR
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.  The
option names and data formats are described below.   It is not
necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those
options which are needed by clients must be specified.
.PP
Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:
.PP
The
.B ip-address
data type can be entered either as an explicit IP
address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g.,
haagen.isc.org).  When entering a domain name, be sure that that
domain name resolves to a single IP address.
.PP
The
.B int32
data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.   The 
.B uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.   The 
.B int16
and
.B uint16
data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.   The 
.B int8
and
.B uint8
data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.
Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.
.PP
The
.B string
data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be
enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify a domain-name
option, the syntax would be
.nf
.sp 1
	option domain-name "isc.org";
.fi
.PP
The
.B flag
data type specifies a boolean value.   Booleans can be either true or
false (or on or off, if that makes more sense to you).
.PP
The
.B data-string
data type specifies either an NVT ASCII string
enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, seperated by colons.   For example:
.nf
.sp 1
	option dhcp-client-identifier "CLIENT-FOO";
or
	option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
.fi
.PP
The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the latest IETF draft document on DHCP options.   Options which
are not listed by name may be defined by the name option-\fInnn\fR,
where \fInnn\fI is the decimal number of the option code.   These
options may be followed either by a string, enclosed in quotes, or by
a series of octets, expressed as two-digit hexadecimal numbers seperated
by colons.   For example:
.PP
.nf
	option option-133 "my-option-133-text";
	option option-129 1:54:c9:2b:47;
.fi
.PP
Because dhcpd does not know the format of these undefined option codes,
no checking is done to ensure the correctness of the entered data.
.PP
The standard options are:
.PP
.B option subnet-mask \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
The subnet mask option specifies the client's subnet mask as per RFC
950.  If no subnet mask option is provided anywhere in scope, as a
last resort dhcpd will use the subnet mask from the subnet declaration
for the network on which an address is being assigned.  However,
.I any
subnet-mask option declaration that is in scope for the address being
assigned will override the subnet mask specified in the subnet
declaration.
.RE
