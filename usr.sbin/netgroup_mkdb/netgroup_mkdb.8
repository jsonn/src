.Dt NETGROUP_MKDB 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm netgroup_mkdb
.Nd generate the netgroup database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl o Ar database
.Op file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates a
.Xr db 3
database for the specified file.
If no file is specified, then
.Pa /etc/netgroup
is used.
This database is installed into
.Pa /etc/netgroup.db.
The file must be in the correct format (see
.Xr netgroup 5 ).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl o Ar database
Put the output databases in the named file.
.El
.Pp
The databases are used by the C library netgroup routines (see
.Xr getnetgrent 3 ).
.Pp
.Nm
exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width 24n -compact
.It Pa /etc/netgroup.db
The current netgroup database
.It Pa /etc/netgroup.db.tmp
A temporary file
.It Pa /etc/netgroup
The current netgroup file
.El
.Sh BUGS
Because
.Nm
guarantees not to install a partial destination file it must
build a temporary file in the same file system and if successful use
.Xr rename 2
to install over the destination file.
.Pp
If
.Nm
fails it will leave the previous version of the destination file intact.
