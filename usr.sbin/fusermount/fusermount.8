.Dt FUSERMOUNT 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fusermount
.Nd manage librefuse mount items
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl chpVx
.Op Fl d Ar name
.Ar refuseoptions
.Nm
.Fl u
.Ar mountpoint(s)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility acts as a frontend to the
.Xr refuse 3
library, allowing mounting and unmounting of
refuse-based
file systems.
.Pp
There are essentially two forms of the
.Nm
command.
The first, and default option, is to mount a
refuse-based
file system.
By using the
.Fl u
argument, the file system can be unmounted.
.Pp
The arguments to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Set a flag to enable kernel caching of files.
At present this option has no effect.
.It Fl d Ar name
Make the name argument appear as the file system
name in
.Xr mount 8
and
.Xr df 1
output.
.It Fl h
Print a usage message and exit.
.It Fl p
Check the file permissions.
At present this option has no effect.
.It Fl V
Display the
.Nm
version on stdout, and then exit successfully.
.It Fl x
Allow mortal (non-root) users to access the file system.
At present, this option has no effect.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is included mainly for compatibility reasons, since some
file systems demand its existence.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
returns 0 for successful operation, or
non-zero if one of the operations did not complete successfully.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Dl fusermount -d ntfs-3g unused mount.ntfs-3g ntfs.img /mnt
will mount the file
.Pa ntfs.img
on the directory
.Pa /mnt .
Please note the
.Pa unused
argument in the command, which is necessary for compatibility
with other implementations of the
.Nm
command.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr puffs 3 ,
.Xr refuse 3 ,

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .

utility was written by
