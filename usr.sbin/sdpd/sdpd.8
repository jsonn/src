.Sh NAME
.Nm sdpd
.Nd Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dh
.Op Fl c Ar path
.Op Fl G Ar group
.Op Fl g Ar group
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon keeps track of the Bluetooth services registered on the host
and responds to Service Discovery inquiries from the remote Bluetooth devices.
.Pp
In order to use any service remote Bluetooth device need to send Service
Search and Service Attribute or Service Search Attribute request over
Bluetooth L2CAP connection on SDP PSM (0x0001).
The
.Nm
daemon will try to find matching Service Record in its Service Database
and will send appropriate response back.
The remote device then will process the response, extract all required
information and will make a separate connection in order to use the service.
.Pp
Bluetooth applications, running on the host, register services with
the local
.Nm
daemon.
Operation like service registration, service removal and service change are
performed over the control socket.
It is possible to query entire content of the
.Nm
Service Database with
.Xr sdpquery 1
by issuing
.Cm browse
command on the control socket.
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar path
Specify path to the control socket.
The default path is
.Pa /var/run/sdp .
.It Fl d
Do not detach from the controlling terminal.
.It Fl G Ar group
Grant permission to members of the
.Ar group
to modify the
.Nm
Service Database.
.It Fl g Ar group
Specifies the group the
.Nm
should run as after it initializes.
The value specified may be either a group name or a numeric group ID.
This only works if
.Nm
was started as root.
The default group name is
.Dq Li _sdpd .
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.
.It Fl u Ar user
Specifies the user the
.Nm
should run as after it initializes.
The value specified may be either a user name or a numeric user ID.
This only works if
.Nm
was started as root.
The default user name is
.Dq Li _sdpd .
.El
.Sh CAVEAT
The
.Nm
daemon
will listen for incoming L2CAP connections on a wildcard BD_ADDR.
.Pp
In case of multiple Bluetooth devices connected to the same host it is
possible to specify which services should be
.Dq bound
to which Bluetooth device.
Such assignment should be done at service registration time.
.Pp
Requests to register, remove or change service can only be made via the
control socket.
The
.Nm
daemon will check the peer's credentials and will only accept the request
when the peer is the superuser, of if the peer is a member of the group
specified with the
.Fl G
option.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon does not check for duplicated Service Records.
It only performs minimal checking on the service data sent in the Service
Register request.
It is assumed that application must obtain all required resources such
as RFCOMM channels etc., before registering the service.
