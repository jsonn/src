.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command controls the operation of WaveLAN/IEEE wireless networking
devices via the
.Xr wi 4
and
.Xr awi 4
drivers. Most of the parameters that can be changed relate to the
IEEE 802.11 protocol which the WaveLAN implements. This includes
the station name, whether the station is operating in ad-hoc (point
to point) or BSS (service set) mode, and the network name of a service
set to join (IBSS) if BSS mode is enabled. The
.Nm
command can also be used to view the current settings of these paremeters
and to dump out the values of the card's statistics counters.
.Pp
The
.Ar iface
argument given to
.Nm
should be the logical interface name associated with the WaveLAN/IEEE
device (wi0, wi1, etc...).
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl o
Display the current settings of the specified WaveLAN/IEEE interface.
This retrieves the current card settings from the driver and prints them
out. Using the additional
.Fl o
flag will cause
.Nm
to print out the statistics counters instead of the card settings.
.It Fl e Ar 0|1
Enable or disable WEP encryption. Permitted values are
.Ar 0
(encryption disabled) or
.Ar 1
(encryption enabled). Encryption is off by default.
.It Fl k Ar key Xo
.Op Fl v Ar 1|2|3|4
.Xc
Set WEP encryption keys. There are four default encryption keys that can be
programmed. A specific key can be set using the
.Fl v
flag. If the
.Fl v
flag is not specified, the first key will be set. Encryption keys can either
be normal text (i.e., "hello") or a series of hexadecimal digits
(i.e., "0x1234512345"). For WaveLAN Silver cards, the key is
restricted to 40 bits, hence the key can be either a 5-character text string
or 10 hexadecimal digits. For WaveLAN Gold cards, the key can be up to
112 bits, which means the key can be specified as either a 14-character
text string or 28 hexadecimal digits.  (The card claims to be 128-bit RC4,
but you can only send 112 bits to the driver.  Strange, I wonder where the
other 16 bits come from, and what they are.)
.It Fl T Ar 1|2|3|4
Specify which of the four WEP encryption keys will be used to encrypt
transmitted packets.
.It Fl t Ar tx rate
Set the transmit rate of the specified interface. The legal values
for the transmit rate vary depending on whether the interface is a
standard WaveLAN/IEEE or a WaveLAN/IEEE Turbo adapter. The standard
NICs support a maximum transmit rate of 2Mbps while the turbo NICs
support a maximum speed of 6Mbps. The following table shows the
legal transmit rate settings and the corresponding transmit speeds:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -column "TX rate " "NIC speed "
.Em "TX rate	NIC speed"
1	Fixed Low (1Mbps)
2	Fixed Standard (2Mbps)
3	Auto Rate Select (High)
4	Fixed Medium (4Mbps)
5	Fixed High (6Mbps)
6	Auto Rate Select (Standard)
7	Auto Rate Select (Medium)
11	Fixed Turbo (11Mbps)
.El
.Ed
.Pp
The standard NICs support only settings 1 through 3. Turbo NICs support
all the above listed speed settings.
The default driver setting is 3 (auto rate select).
.It Fl n Ar network name
Set the name of the service set (IBSS) that this station wishes to
join. The
.Ar network name
can be any text string up to 30 characters in length. The default name
is the empty string which should allow the station to connect to the first
available access point. The interface should be set for BSS mode using
the
.Fl p
flag in order for this to work.
.It Fl s Ar station name
Sets the
.Ar station name
for the specified interface. The
.Ar station name
is used for diagnostic purposes. The Lucent WaveMANAGER sofware can
poll the names of remote hosts.
.It Fl c Ar 0|1
Allow the station to create a service set (IBSS). Permitted values
are 0 (don't create IBSS) and 1 (enable creation of IBSS). The default
is 0.
.Pp
Note: this option is provided for experimental purposes only: enabling
the creation of an IBSS on a host system doesn't appear to actually work.
.It Fl q Ar SSID
Specify the name of an IBSS (SSID) to create on a given interface.
The
.Ar SSID
can be any text string up to 30 characters long.
.Pp
Note: this option is provided for experimental purposes only: enabling
the creation of an IBSS on a host system doesn't appear to actually work.
.It Fl p Ar port type
Set the
.Ar port type
for a specified interface. The legal values for
.Ar port type
are 1 (BSS mode) and 3 (ad-hoc) mode. In ad-hoc mode, the station can
communicate directly with any other stations within direct radio range
(provided that they are also operating in ad-hoc mode). In BSS mode,
hosts must associate with a service set controlled by an access point,
which relays traffic between end stations. The default setting is 3
(ad-hoc mode).
.It Fl a Ar access_point_density
Specify the
.Ar access point density
for a given interface. Legal values are 1 (low), 2 (medium) and 3 (high).
This setting influences some of the radio modem threshold settings.
.It Fl m Ar MAC address
Set the station address for the specified interface. The
.Ar MAC address
is specified as a series of six hexadecimal values separated by colons,
e.g.: 00:60:1d:12:34:56. This programs the new address into the card
and updates the interface as well.
.It Fl d Ar max_data_length
Set the maximum receive and transmit frame size for a specified interface.
The
.Ar max data length
can be any number from 350 to 2304. The default is 2304.
.It Fl r Ar RTS threshold
Set the RTS/CTS threshold for a given interface. This controls the
number of bytes used for the RTS/CTS handshake boundary. The
.Ar RTS threshold
can be any value between 0 and 2047. The default is 2347.
.It Fl f Ar frequency
Set the radio frequency of a given interface. The
.Ar frequency
should be specfied as a channel ID as shown in the table below. The
list of available frequencies is dependent on radio regulations specified
by regional authorities. Recognized regulatory authorities include
the FCC (United States), ETSI (Europe), France and Japan. Frequencies
in the table are specified in Mhz.

.El
.Ed
.Pp
If an illegal channel is specified, the
NIC will revert to its default channel. For NICs sold in the United States
and Europe, the default channel is 3. For NICs sold in France, the default
channel is 11. For NICs sold in Japan, the default channel is 14, and
it is the only available channel for pre-11Mbps NICs.
Note that two stations must be set to the same channel in order to
communicate.
.It Fl P Ar 0|1
Enable or disable power management on a given interface. Enabling
power management uses an alternating sleep/wake protocol to help
conserve power on mobile stations, at the cost of some increased
receive latency. Power management is off by default. Note that power
management requires the cooperation of an access point in order to
function; it is not functional in ad-hoc mode. Also, power management
is only implemented in Lucent WavePOINT firmware version 2.03 or
later, and in WaveLAN PCMCIA adapter firmware 2.00 or later. Older
revisions will silently ignore the power management setting. Legal
values for this parameter are 0 (off) and 1 (on).
.It Fl S Ar max sleep interval
Specify the sleep interval to use when power management is enabled.
The
.Are max sleep interval
is specified in milliseconds. The default is 100.
