.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can used to control and inspect CPU sets.
.Pp
The system always contains at least one CPU set: the default
set.
The default set must contain at least one online CPU at all times.
.Pp
Available options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Assign one or more CPUs to the set
.Ar setid .
In the current implementation, a CPU may only be present in one set.
CPU IDs are as reported and used by the
.Xr cpuctl 8
command.
.It Fl b
Bind one or more processes to the set
.Ar setid .
All LWPs within the processes will be affected.
Bindings are inherited when new LWPs or processes are forked.
However, setting a new binding on a parent process does not affect the
bindings of its existing child processes.
.It Fl c
Create a new CPU set.
If successful, the ID of the new set will be printed.
If a list of CPU IDs is provided, those CPUs will be assigned to the set
upon creation.
Otherwise, the set will be created empty.
.It Fl d
Delete the CPU set specified by
.Ar setid .
Any LWPs bound to the set will be re-bound to the default CPU set.
.It Fl e
Execute a command within the CPU set specified by
.Ar setid .
.It Fl i
List all CPU sets.
For each set, print the member CPUs.
If
.Nm
is run without any options, it behaves as if
.Fl i
were given.
.It Fl p
List all CPUs.
For each CPU, print the associated CPU set.
.It Fl r
Remove a CPU from its current set, and return it back to the default CPU
set.
.It Fl u
Bind the specified processes to the system default CPU set.

command first appeared in
