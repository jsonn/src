.Sc
interface.  If the
.Nm unit-number
is unspecified, it defaults to 0.  These statistics are displayed at
regular intervals.
.Pp
The display is split horizontally into input and output sections
containing columns of statistics describing the properties and volume
of packets received and transmitted by the specified interface.
.Pp
The first report will consist of a snapshot of the interface's present
statistics.  All further output will describe activity between report
intervals.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "system   "
.It Fl v
Display additional statistics demonstrating the efficacy of VJ header
compression and providing more explicit information on failure
distribution.
.It Fl i
Specifies the interval between reports. The default interval is 5 seconds.
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified.
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default
