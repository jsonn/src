[ Old announcement from version 2.2: ]

New features in version 2.2 include:

o  A new "td" tag allows the specification of a "TFTP directory" for use
   with so-called "secure" implementations of tftpd which chroot(2) to a
   particular directory.

o  A new "sa" tag allows the explicit specification of the TFTP
   "server address."  Formerly, the 'siaddr' field of the BOOTREPLY was
   always filled with the IP address of the BOOTP server.  The "sa" tag
   now allows the BOOTP server and the TFTP server to be two different
   machines, if desired.

o  The server now automatically determines whether it is running as a
   standalone program (e.g. invoked by hand from a shell) or as a child of
   /etc/inetd.  The -s option and a new -i option are provided to force
   standalone or inetd mode if necessary.

o  When the vendor magic cookie is zero, BOOTP replies now default to the
   RFC 1084 vendor format, rather than the old CMU format.  This helps
   interoperability with uncooperative BOOTP clients which want RFC 1084
   format but don't bother filling in the magic cookie properly to tell
   the server... *sigh*  (This makes the ":vm=rfc1048:" tag unnecessary
   in most cases now.  Oh, the "vm" tag now accepts "rfc1084" as well as
   "rfc1048" -- they mean the same thing.)

o  Log messages now include the specific network type.  For example, rather
   than saying "request from hardware address ABCDEF012345", the message is
   now "request from Ethernet address ABCEDF012345", or "request from
   IEEE802 address 4000A1B2C3D4".


Bug fixes in this version include:

o  The automatic bootfile-size calculation now works correctly when the
   file size is an exact multiple of 512 octets.  It used to return a number
   which was one 512-octet unit greater than necessary.

o  A bug in comparing subnet masks has been fixed.

o  A bug in calculating the size of the vendor information area when
   inserting the hostname has been fixed.


Other changes:

o  The man page has been split into two man pages.  One covers the server
   itself (bootpd.8) and the other covers the configuration file format
   (bootptab.5).


[ Old announcement from version 2.1: ]

Subject: Updated RFC1048 BOOTP server now available

Well, no surprise, bootpd 2.0 had a few bugs.  A new improved version,
bootpd 2.1, is now available for anonymous FTP from lancaster.andrew.cmu.edu
(128.2.13.21).  The new server can be found in pub/bootp.2.1.tar.

Bug fixes and improvements in version 2.1 include:

o  The definition of "access to the bootfile" has been changed to require the
   public read access bit to be set.  This is required by tftpd(8), so the
   server will not reply with a file which a client cannot obtain via TFTP.
o  The RFC1084 bootfile size tag has been implemented.  It allows either
   automatic or manual specification of the bootfile size in 512-octet blocks.
o  Generic tags now work as advertised.
o  A subtle bug which caused strange parsing behavior under certain conditions
   has been fixed.
o  The RFC1048 vendor information now has the correct byte order on
   little-endien machines such as the VAX.
o  Failure to specify the bootfile home directory and/or default bootfile in
   the configuration file no longer causes server crashes.  The server now
   makes a reasonably intelligent choice if this configuration information is
   missing.  This is documented in the man page.
o  BOOTP requests from clients which already know their IP addresses no longer
   cause server crashes.

[ Old announcement from version 2.0: ]

Subject: RFC-1048 compatible BOOTP server now available


An RFC-1048 (BOOTP Vendor Information Extensions) compatible BOOTP (RFC-951)
server is now available for anonymous FTP from lancaster.andrew.cmu.edu
(128.2.13.21).  The new server can be found in pub/bootp.2.0.tar.  This is
an enhanced version of the existing CMU BOOTP server which was derived from
the original BOOTP server created by Bill Croft at Stanford.

New features and changes in version 2.0 include:

o  Full support for the vendor information extensions described in RFC-1048.
o  Faster response time (host lookup via hash table instead of linear search).
o  New termcap-like configuration file format which allows greater flexibility
   in specifying the variable vendor information of RFC-1048.  Host entries
   may refer to other hosts as templates so that redundant information need
   be specified only once.
o  Continued support for the CMU vendor information format.  The server may
   be configured on a per-host basis to always reply with a certain vendor
   information format or to reply based on the client's request.
o  Expanded logging.
o  The server may now be run by inetd or as a standalone program like the
   old version.
o  The configuration and debugging dump files may be specified on the command
   line.


The server has been successfully tested on the following machines:

    IBM RT PC running ACIS 4.3 (4.3 BSD)
    Sun 3/50 running SunOS 3.5
    DEC MicroVAX II running Ultrix 1.1
    DEC MicroVAX II running Ultrix 2.2


Please direct questions, comments, and bug reports to
Walt Wimer <ww0n@andrew.cmu.edu> or Drew Perkins <ddp@andrew.cmu.edu>.
