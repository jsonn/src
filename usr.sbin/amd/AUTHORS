PRIMARY AUTHORS AND MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO AM_UTILS:

Original authors of amd were the Berkeley team and especially Jan-Simon
Pendry.  Since then many people have contributed patches.

This file lists the ones who contributed major code changes, in no
particular order, and I thank them all.  This is of course not to diminish
the smaller contributes of the many others.  Thank you all.

* Erez Zadok <ezk@cs.columbia.edu>

The most significant changes were made by Erez Zadok in terms of bug fixes,
ports, and new features added.  Erez Zadok is the current maintainer of
am-utils, as of January 1997.

There is a mailing list dedicated to developers of am-utils.  To subscribe
to it, send mail to majordomo@majordomo.cs.columbia.edu, with the body of
the message having the single line "subscribe amd-dev".

* Randall S. Winchester <rsw@glue.umd.edu>

May 7, 1997: contributed a special version of upl102 that included NFS V.3
support.  Some of the code was contributed by Christos Zoulas
<christos@deshaw.com>.  I (Erez) ported these changes to am-utils.

September 12, 1997: lots of small prototype cleanups and fixes to numerous
files.

January 27, 1998: support pid files in the amd.conf file.  Provide base name
for hesiod zone files.  Always use /etc/amd.conf if exists.

February 1, 1998: fixes for NetBSD to better detect its features.

* Hannes Reinecke <hare@MathI.UNI-Heidelberg.DE>
