.Sh NAME
.Nm wsconscfg
.Nd configure virtual terminals on a wscons display
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar <ctldev>
.Op Fl d Op Fl F
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl t Ar <type>
.Op Fl e Ar <emul>
.Ar index
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool allows to create and delete virtual terminals on display devices
controlled by the wscons terminal framework if the underlying display hardware
driver supports multiple screens. Further it controls the assignment of
keyboards to displays.
The
.Ar index
argument specifies which virtual terminal is to be configured; the allowed
numbers are from 0 to an implementation-specified value (currently 7, allowing
for 8 virtual terminals on a display).
In keyboard configuration mode, it specifies the
.Xr wskbd 4
device to attach or detach.
Without further option arguments, a virtual terminal is created with
implementation specific properties and a default terminal emulation variant
selected at kernel compile time.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxx
.It Fl f Ar ctldev
Specify the control device of the wscons display to operate on.
Default is
.Pa /dev/ttyEcfg .
.It Fl d
Delete the specified terminal. A terminal opened by a program will not be
deleted unless the
.Fl F
option is applied. Terminals used by the operating system console or a
graphics program (X server) cannot be deleted. With the
.Fl k
flag, the keyboard specified by
.Dq index
will be detached from the wscons display.
With the
.Fl m
flag, the multiplexor specified by
.Dq index
will be detached from the wscons display.
.It Fl F
Force deleting of a terminal even if it is in use by a user space program.
.It Fl k
Do keyboard related operations instead of virtual screen configuration.
Without other flags, a keyboard will be attached to the display device. The
.Dq index
argument can be omitted, in this case the first free keyboard will be used.
.It Fl m
Do multiplexor related operations instead of virtual screen configuration.
Without other flags, a multiplexor will be attached to the display device.
.It Fl t Ar type
Specify a screen type to use. Screen types refer to display format, colour
depth and other low-level display properties. Valid
.Ar type
arguments are defined by the underlying display device driver.
.It Fl e Ar emul
Specify the terminal emulation to use for the virtual terminal. The set of
available terminal emulations is determined at kernel compile time. See
.Xr wscons 4
for details.
.El
.Pp
Typically, the
.Nm
utility will be invoked in system startup by the
.Pa /etc/rc.d/wscons
script, controlled by the
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf
configuration file.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl wsconscfg -t 80x50 -e vt100 1
.Pp
Configure screen 1 (i.e. the second), it will get the type
.Dq 80x50
and use the VT100 terminal emulation. (Note:
.Dq 80x50
is a screen type offered by the
.Xr vga 4
display driver. In this particular case, an 8x8-font must be loaded
before to make the screen useful. See
.Xr wsfontload 8 . )
.Pp
.Dl wsconscfg -k
.Pp
Connect the first unconnected keyboard to the display.
.Sh BUGS
There should be an easy way to get a list of the screen types available
on a display, and of the emulations supported by the kernel.
