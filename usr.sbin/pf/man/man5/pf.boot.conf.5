.Sh NAME
.Nm pf.boot.conf
.Nd initial configuration for packet filter
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is used as initial configuration for the
.Xr pf 4
packet filter.
This file is loaded before the network is configured by the
.Xr rc.d 8
script
.Em network .
Its purpose is to protect the machine from possible attacks between
the network configuration and the loading of the final ruleset.
.Pp
The syntax of this file is described in
.Xr pf.conf 5 .
.Pp
Note that at the stage the configuration is loaded, the network
interface(s) do not have an IP address yet, so you
.Em cannot
use rules that derive addresses from an interface (for example:
.Dq pass out from any to fxp0 ) .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/defaults/pf.boot.conf" -compact
.It Pa /etc/defaults/pf.boot.conf
Default initial ruleset file.
.It Pa /etc/pf.boot.conf
Override of the default initial ruleset file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
When using NFS (e.g. diskless situations), you'll also need the following
rules in addition to the default rules to unblock NFS:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
scrub in all no-df
pass in proto udp from any port { 111, 2049 } to any
pass out proto udp from any to any port { 111, 2049 }
