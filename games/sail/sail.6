.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a computer version of Avalon Hill's game of fighting sail
originally developed by S. Craig Taylor.
.Pp
Players of
.Nm
take command of an old-fashioned Man of War and fight other
players or the computer.
They may re-enact one of the many
historical sea battles recorded in the game, or they can choose
a fictional battle.
.Pp
As a sea captain in the
.Nm Sail
Navy, the player has complete control over the workings of his ship.
He must order every maneuver, change the set of his sails, and judge the
right moment to let loose the terrible destruction of his broadsides.
In addition to fighting the enemy, he must harness the powers of the wind
and sea to make them work for him.
The outcome of many battles during the
age of sail was decided by the ability of one captain to hold the
.Sq weather gage .
.Pp
The flags are:

.El
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION
.Nm
is a multiplayer game.
Each player runs
.Nm
to either connect to an existing game or start a new one.
The game server (or
.Dq driver )
is an extra fork of the
.Nm
program created when a game is started.
The driver coordinates the game and runs the computer ships.
.\" .Pp
.\" Because the
.\" driver
.\" must calculate moves for each ship it controls, the
.\" more ships the computer is playing, the slower the game will appear.
.Pp
If a player joins a game in progress, a synchronization process occurs
.Pq a rather slow process for everyone ,
and then the game continues.
.Pp
Note that while each scenario can be running independently with
different players, each scenario can also only be running once at any
given time.
.Ss COMMUNICATION
To implement a multi-user game in Version 7 UNIX, which was the operating
system
.Nm
was first written under, the communicating processes must use a common
temporary file as a place to read and write messages.
For e.g. scenario 21, this file is
.Pa /var/games/sail/#sailsink.21 .
Corresponding file names are used for the other scenarios.
.Pp
In addition, a locking mechanism must be provided to ensure exclusive
access to the shared file.
.Nm
uses a technique stolen from an old game called
.Dq pubcaves
by Jeff Cohen.
Processes do a busy wait in the loop
.Bd -literal -offset indent
for (n = 0; link(sync_file, sync_lock) \*[Lt] 0 \*[Am]\*[Am] n \*[Lt] 30; n++)
        sleep(2);

.Ed
until they are able to create a hard link named e.g.
.Pa /var/games/sail/#saillock.21 .
where 21 is again the scenario number.
Since creating a hard link is atomic, a process where this succeeds
will have exclusive access to the temporary file.
.Ss CONSEQUENCES OF SEPARATE PLAYER AND DRIVER PROCESSES
When players do something of global interest, such as moving or firing,
the driver must coordinate the action with the other ships in the game.
For example, if a player wants to move in a certain direction, he writes a
message into the temporary file requesting the driver to move his ship.
Each
.Dq turn ,
the driver reads all the messages sent from the players and
decides what happened.
It then writes back into the temporary file new values of variables, etc.
.Pp
The most noticeable effect this communication has on the game is the
delay in moving.
Suppose a player types a move for his ship and hits return.
What happens then?
The player process saves up messages to
be written to the temporary file in a buffer.
Every 7 seconds or so, the player process gets exclusive access to
the temporary file and writes out its buffer to the file.
The driver, running asynchronously, must
read in the movement command, process it, and write out the results.
This takes two exclusive accesses to the temporary file.
Finally, when the player process gets around to doing another 7-second
update, the results of the move are displayed on the screen.
Hence, every movement requires four
exclusive accesses to the temporary file (anywhere from 7 to 21 seconds
depending upon asynchrony) before the player sees the results of his moves.
.Pp
In practice, the delays are not as annoying as they would appear.
There is room for
.Dq pipelining
in the movement.
After the player writes out
a first movement message, a second movement command can then be issued.
The first message will be in the temporary file waiting for the driver, and
the second will be in the file buffer waiting to be written to the file.
Thus, by always typing moves a turn ahead of the time, the player can
sail around quite quickly.
.Pp
If the player types several movement commands between two 7-second updates,
only the last movement command typed will be seen by the driver.
Movement commands within the same update
.Dq overwrite
each other, in a sense.
.Ss DEFECTS OF THIS SYSTEM IN THE MODERN WORLD
Quite a few.
.Pp
It should be thrown out and replaced with something socket-based.
.Sh HISTORICAL INFO
Old square-riggers were very maneuverable ships capable of intricate
sailing.
Their only disadvantage was an inability to sail very close to the wind.
The design of a wooden ship allowed for the guns to bear only to the
left and right sides.
A few guns of small
aspect (usually 6 or 9 pounders) could point forward, but their
effect was small compared to a 68 gun broadside of 24- or 32-pounders.
The guns bear approximately like so:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

       \\
        b----------------
    ---0
        \\
         \\
          \\     up to a range of ten (for round shot)
           \\
            \\
             \\

.Ed
Firing a broadside into a ship lengthwise, from bow to stern or stern
to bow, is called
.Em raking .
This did a great deal more damage, because the shot tended to bounce
along the deck.
Because the bows of a ship are very strong and present a smaller
target than the stern, a stern rake (firing from the stern to the bow) causes
more damage than a bow rake.
.Bd -literal -offset indent

                        b
                       00   ----  Stern rake!
                         a

.Ed
Most ships were equipped with
.Em carronades ,
which were very large, close range cannons.
American ships from the revolution until the War of 1812
were almost entirely armed with carronades.
.Pp
The period of history covered in
.Nm
is approximately from the 1770's until the end of Napoleonic France in 1815.
There are many excellent books about the age of sail.
.Pq See Sx REFERENCES .
.Pp
Fighting ships came in several sizes classed by armament.
The mainstays of
any fleet were its
.Em ships of the line ,
or
.Em line of battle ships .
These were so named because in fleet actions they would sail in lines
so as to present all broadsides to the enemy at once.
.\" ... to sail close enough for mutual support.
The modern terms
.Dq ocean liner ,
and
.Dq battleship
are derived from
.Dq ship of the line .
.Pp
The pride of the fleet were the
.Dq first-rates .
These were huge three decked ships of the line mounting 80 to 136 guns.
The guns in the three tiers
were usually 18, 24, and 32 pounders in that order from top to bottom.
.Pp
Lesser ships were known as
.Dq second-rates ,
.Dq third-rates ,
and even
.Dq fourth-rates .
The most common size was the 74 gun two-decked ship of the line.
The two gun decks usually mounted 18 and 24 pounder guns.
.Pp
.Em Razees
were ships of the line with one deck sawed off.
These mounted 40-64 guns and were
a poor cross between a frigate and a line of battle ship.
They neither had the speed of the former nor the firepower of the latter.
.Pp
The next class was the
.Em frigate .
Often called the
.Dq eyes of the fleet ,
frigates came in many sizes mounting anywhere from 32 to 44 guns.
These were very handy vessels.
They could outsail anything bigger and outshoot anything smaller.
Frigates did not generally fight in lines of battle as the much bigger
74s did.
Instead, they were sent on individual missions or in small groups to
harass the enemy's rear or capture crippled ships.
.\" cutting out expeditions or boat actions.
They were much more useful this way, in missions away from the fleet.
They could hit hard and get away fast.
.Pp
Lastly, there were the corvettes, sloops, and brigs.
These were smaller ships mounting typically fewer than 20 guns.
A corvette was only slightly
smaller than a frigate, so one might have up to 30 guns.
Sloops were used for carrying despatches or passengers.
Brigs were small vessels typically built for land-locked lakes.
.Sh SAIL PARTICULARS
Ships in
.Nm
are represented on the screen by two characters.
One character represents the bow of
the ship, and the other represents the stern.
Ships have nationalities and numbers.
The first ship of a nationality is number 0, the second
number 1, etc.
Therefore, the first British ship in a game would be printed as
.Dq b0 .
The second Brit would be
.Dq b1 ,
and the fifth Don would be
.Dq s4 .
.Pp
Ships can set normal sails, called
.Em Battle Sails ,
or bend on extra canvas called
.Em Full Sails .
A ship under full sail is a beautiful sight indeed,
and it can move much faster than a ship under battle sails.
The only trouble is, with full sails set, there is so much tension on sail and
rigging that a well aimed round shot can burst a sail into ribbons where
it would only cause a little hole in a loose sail.
For this reason, rigging damage is doubled on a ship with full sails set.
This does not mean that full sails should never be used; the author
recommends keeping them up right into the heat of battle.
When a ship has full sails set, the letter for its nationality is
capitalized.
E.g., a Frog,
.Dq f0 ,
with full sails set would be printed as
.Dq F0 .
.Pp
When a ship is battered into a listing hulk, the last man aboard
.Em strikes the colors .
This ceremony is the ship's formal surrender.
The nationality character of a surrendered ship is printed as
.So
!
.Sc .
E.g., the Frog of our last example would soon be
.Dq !0 .
.Pp
A ship that reaches this point has a chance of catching fire or sinking.
A sinking ship has a
.Sq ~
printed for its nationality,
and a ship on fire and about to explode has a
.Sq #
printed.
.Pp
Ships that have struck can be captured;
captured ships become the nationality of the prize crew.
Therefore, if
an American ship captures a British ship, the British ship will
thenceforth have an
.Sq a
printed for its nationality.
In addition, the ship number is changed
to one of the characters
.So
\*[Am]'()*+
.Sc
corresponding to its original number
.So
012345
.Sc .
E.g., the
.Dq b0
captured by an American becomes the
.Dq a\*[Am] .
The
.Dq s4
captured by a Frog becomes the
.Dq f* .
.Pp
The ultimate example is, of course, an exploding Brit captured by an
American:
.Dq #\*[Am] .
.Sh MOVEMENT
Movement is the most confusing part of
.Nm
to many.
Ships can head in 8 directions:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
                         0      0      0
b       b       b0      b       b       b       0b      b
0        0                                             0

.Ed
The stern of a ship moves when it turns.
The bow remains stationary.
Ships can always turn, regardless of the wind (unless they are becalmed).
All ships drift when they lose headway.
If a ship doesn't move forward at all for two turns, it will begin to drift.
If a ship has begun to
drift, then it must move forward before it turns, if it plans to do
more than make a right or left turn, which is always possible.
.Pp
Movement commands to
.Nm
are a string of forward moves and turns.
An example is
.Dq l3 .
It will turn a ship left and then move it ahead 3 spaces.
In the drawing above, the
.Dq b0
made 7 successive left turns.
When
.Nm
prompts you for a move, it prints three characters of import.
E.g.,
.Dl move (7, 4):
The first number is the maximum number of moves you can make, including turns.
The second number is the maximum number of turns you can make.
Between the numbers is sometimes printed a quote
.Pq ' .
If the quote is present, it means that your ship has been drifting, and
you must move ahead to regain headway before you turn (see note above).
Some of the possible moves for the example above are as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
move (7, 4): 7
move (7, 4): 1
move (7, 4): d          /* drift, or do nothing */
move (7, 4): 6r
move (7, 4): 5r1
move (7, 4): 4r1r
move (7, 4): l1r1r2
move (7, 4): 1r1r1r1
.Ed
.Pp
Because square riggers performed so poorly sailing into the wind, if at
any point in a movement command you turn into the wind, the movement stops
there.
E.g.,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
move (7, 4): l1l4
Movement Error;
Helm: l1l

.Ed
Moreover, upon making a turn, the movement allowance drops to the
lesser of what remains this turn and what would be available when
going in the new direction.
Thus, any turn closer to the wind will generally preclude sailing the
full distance printed in the
.Dq move
prompt.
.Pp
Old sailing captains had to keep an eye constantly on the wind.
Captains in
.Nm
are no different.
A ship's ability to move depends on its attitude to the wind.
The best angle possible is to have the wind off your quarter, that is,
just off the stern.
The direction rose on the side of the screen gives the
possible movements for your ship at all positions to the wind.
Battle
sail speeds are given first, and full sail speeds are given in parenthesis.
.Bd -literal

				 0 1(2)
				\\|/
				-^-3(6)
				/|\\
				 | 4(7)
				3(6)

.Ed
Pretend the bow of your ship
.Pq the Dq ^
is pointing upward and the wind is
blowing from the bottom to the top of the page.
The numbers at the bottom
.Dq 3(6)
will be your speed under battle or full
sails in such a situation.
If the wind is off your quarter, then you can move
.Dq 4(7) .
If the wind is off your beam,
.Dq 3(6) .
If the wind is off your bow, then you can only move
.Dq 1(2) .
Facing into the wind, you cannot move at all.
Ships facing into the wind are said to be
.Em in irons .
.Sh WINDSPEED AND DIRECTION
The windspeed and direction is displayed as a weather vane on the
side of the screen.
The number in the middle of the vane indicates the wind
speed, and the + to - indicates the wind direction.
The wind blows from the + sign (high pressure) to the - sign (low pressure).
E.g.,
.Bd -literal
                                |
                                3
                                +
.Ed
.Pp
The wind speeds are:
.Bl -tag -width 012 -compact -offset indent
.It 0
becalmed
.It 1
light breeze
.It 2
moderate breeze
.It 3
fresh breeze
.It 4
strong breeze
.It 5
gale
.It 6
full gale
.It 7
hurricane
.El
If a hurricane shows up, all ships are destroyed.
.Sh GRAPPLING AND FOULING
If two ships collide, they run the risk of becoming tangled together.
This is called
.Em fouling .
Fouled ships are stuck together, and neither can move.
They can unfoul each other if they want to.
Boarding parties can only be
sent across to ships when the antagonists are either fouled or grappled.
.Pp
Ships can grapple each other by throwing grapnels into the rigging of
the other.
.Pp
The number of fouls and grapples you have are displayed on the upper
right of the screen.
.Sh BOARDING
Boarding was a very costly venture in terms of human life.
Boarding parties may be formed in
.Nm
to either board an enemy ship or to defend your own ship against attack.
Men organized as Defensive Boarding Parties fight twice as hard to save
their ship as men left unorganized.
.Pp
The boarding strength of a crew depends upon its quality and upon the
number of men sent.
.Sh CREW QUALITY
The British seaman was world renowned for his sailing abilities.
American sailors, however, were actually the best seamen in the world.
Because the
American Navy offered twice the wages of the Royal Navy, British seamen
who liked the sea defected to America by the thousands.
.Pp
In
.Nm ,
crew quality is quantized into 5 energy levels.
.Em Elite
crews can outshoot and outfight all other sailors.
.Em Crack
crews are next.
.Em Mundane
crews are average, and
.Em Green
and
.Em Mutinous
crews are below average.
A good rule of thumb is that
.Em Crack
or
.Em Elite
crews get one extra hit
per broadside compared to
.Em Mundane
crews.
Don't expect too much from
.Em Green
crews.
.Sh BROADSIDES
Your two broadsides may be loaded with four kinds of shot: grape, chain,
round, and double.
You have guns and carronades in both the port and starboard batteries.
Carronades only have a range of two, so you have to get in
close to be able to fire them.
You have the choice of firing at the hull or rigging of another ship.
If the range of the ship is greater than 6,
then you may only shoot at the rigging.
.Pp
The types of shot and their advantages are:
.Bl -tag -width DOUBLEx
.It ROUND
Range of 10.
Good for hull or rigging hits.
.It DOUBLE
Range of 1.
Extra good for hull or rigging hits.
Double takes two turns to load.
.It CHAIN
Range of 3.
Excellent for tearing down rigging.
Cannot damage hull or guns, though.
.It GRAPE
Range of 1.
Sometimes devastating against enemy crews.
.El
.Pp
On the side of the screen is displayed some vital information about your
ship:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Pq left

.Pq right
broadsides are

A
.So
!
.Sc
after the type of shot indicates that it is an initial broadside.
Initial broadside were loaded with care before battle and before
the decks ran red with blood.
As a consequence, initial broadsides are a
little more effective than broadsides loaded later.
A
.Sq *
after the type of shot indicates that the gun
crews are still loading it, and you cannot fire yet.
.Dq Hull
shows how much hull you have left.
.Dq Crew
shows your three sections of crew.
As your crew dies off, your ability to fire decreases.
.Dq Guns
and
.Dq Carr
show your port and starboard guns.
As you lose guns, your ability to fire decreases.
.Dq Rigg
shows how much rigging you have on your 3 or 4 masts.
As rigging is shot away, you lose mobility.
.Sh EFFECTIVENESS OF FIRE
It is very dramatic when a ship fires its thunderous broadsides, but the
mere opportunity to fire them does not guarantee any hits.
Many factors influence the destructive force of a broadside.
First of all, and the chief factor, is distance.
It is harder to hit a ship at range ten than it is
to hit one sloshing alongside.
Next is raking.
Raking fire, as mentioned before, can sometimes dismast a ship at range ten.
Next, crew size and quality affects the damage done by a broadside.
The number of guns firing also bears on the point, so to speak.
Lastly, weather affects the accuracy of a broadside.
If the seas are high (5 or 6), then the lower gunports
of ships of the line can't even be opened to run out the guns.
This gives frigates and other flush decked vessels an advantage in a storm.
The scenario
.Em Pellew vs. The Droits de L'Homme
takes advantage of this peculiar circumstance.
.Sh REPAIRS
Repairs may be made to your Hull, Guns, and Rigging at the slow rate of
two points per three turns.
The message "Repairs Completed" will be printed if no more repairs can be made.
.Sh PECULIARITIES OF COMPUTER SHIPS
Computer ships in
.Nm
follow all the rules above with a few exceptions.
Computer ships never repair damage.
If they did, the players could never beat them.
They play well enough as it is.
As a consolation, the computer ships can fire double shot every turn.
That fluke is a good reason to keep your distance.
The driver figures out the moves of the computer ships.
It computes them with a typical A.I. distance
function and a depth first search to find the maximum
.Dq score .
It seems to work fairly well, although I'll be the first to admit it isn't
perfect.

.Sh HISTORY
Dave Riggle wrote the first version of
.Nm
on a PDP\-11/70 in the fall of 1980.
Needless to say, the code was horrendous,
not portable in any sense of the word, and didn't work.
The program was not
very modular and had
.Xr fseek 3
and
.Xr fwrite 3
calls every few lines.
After a tremendous rewrite from the top down,
the first working version was up and running by 1981.
There were several annoying bugs concerning firing broadsides and
finding angles.
.\" No longer true...
.\" .Nm
.\" uses no floating point, by the way, so the direction routines are rather
.\" tricky.
.Pp
Ed Wang rewrote the
.Fn angle
routine in 1981 to be more correct.
He also added code to let a player select
which ship he wanted at the start of the game, instead of always
taking the first one available.
.Pp
Captain Happy (Craig Leres) is responsible for making
.Nm
portable for the first time.
This was no easy task.
Constants like 2 and 10 were very frequent in the code.
The
.Nm
code was also notorious for the use of
.Dq Riggle Memorial Structures .
Many structure references were so long that they ran off the line
printer page.
Here is an example, if you promise not to laugh:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
specs[scene[flog.fgamenum].ship[flog.fshipnum].shipnum].pts
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
received its fourth and most thorough rewrite in the summer and fall
of 1983.
Ed Wang rewrote and modularized the code (a monumental feat)
almost from scratch.
Although he introduced many new bugs, the final result was very much
cleaner and (?) faster.
He added window movement commands and find ship commands.
.Pp
At some currently unknown time,
.Nm
was imported into
.Bx .
