This file describes official patches for the NetBSD 1.1 release.

Jumbo patch 1:

[kernel/i386]: Fix a compilation error when no DMA devices are
configured.

[kernel/i386]: Fix a problem where processes using the FPU would
sporadically core dump.  Known to affect httpd and gopherd, in
particular.

[kernel/i386]: Fix an oversight which caused the Ultrastor 24f probe
to always fail.

[kernel/generic]: Fix a sgtty emulation problem which caused LITOUT
and PASS8 modes to sometimes be set erroneously (sometimes referred to
as `stair-stepping xterms').

[kernel/generic]: Fix a problem in FFS that could cause panics in
ffs_clusteracct() after running fsck(8).
