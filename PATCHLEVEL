This file describes official patches for the NetBSD 1.2 release.

Mondo patch 1:

[ kernel/alpha ] Fix several SCSI protocol errors in the "esp" driver.

[ kernel/sparc ] Fix several SCSI protocol errors in the "esp" driver.

[ kernel/netinet ] Fix handling of long IP packets; no longer succeptible
to the "Windows 95 death ping" bug.

[ netstat(1) ] Display the `toolong' IP stat count, corresponding to
netinet change above.

[ kernel/scsi ] For ioctl commands which may change the device's state,
ensure the caller has the device open for writing (security precaution).

[ lpd(8) ] Fix some errors in the lpd(8) manual page.

[ eeprom(1) ] Discard setgid privileges if we don't need them.

[ kernel/hp300 ] Make sure clock interrupts are disabled at the
end of the delay calibration routine.  Fixes a bug where the kernel
would get a bad pointer reference and crash very early in kernels
without DDB.

[ mt(1) ] Don't attempt to set TCP_MAXSEG for remote mt.
