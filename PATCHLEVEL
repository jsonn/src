This file describes official patches for the NetBSD 1.1 release.


Mondo patch 1:

[kernel/i386]: Fix a compilation error when no DMA devices are
configured.

[kernel/i386]: Fix a problem where processes trying to use the FPU for
the first time would sporadically core dump.  Known to affect httpd
and gopherd, in particular.

[kernel/i386]: Fix an oversight which caused the Ultrastor 24f probe
to always fail.

[kernel/generic]: Fix a sgtty emulation problem which caused LITOUT
and PASS8 modes to sometimes be set erroneously (sometimes referred to
as `stair-stepping xterms').

[kernel/generic]: Fix a problem in FFS that could cause panics in
ffs_clusteracct() after running fsck(8).


Mondo patch 2:

[kernel/i386]: Redo the way the GDT is allocated, to avoid a potential
reentrance problem.

[kernel/generic]: Fix a reversed test in the tty driver that caused
ECHONL to not work correctly.

[kernel/generic]: Fix a problem in many system calls which take a file
descriptor as an argument, which could cause the system to crash.

[kernel/generic]: Speed up searching for a TCP control block by
hashing certain values.

[kernel/generic]: Fix a bad interaction with the Linux NFS server by
not specifying an explicit gid (or uid) in create and related calls.

[kernel/generic]: Fix problems in TCP that could, in strange
circumstances, cause sockets to be left in CLOSE_WAIT or FIN_WAIT_2
states.

[kernel/generic]: Fix a problem in bind(2) that could allow a user to
steal a port from another process.

[user/generic]: Fix oversights in quota-related utilities that would
cause them to not work on file systems with type `ffs' in fstab.

[kernel/sun3]: Make netboot compatible with old Sun3/50 PROMs

[kernel/sun3]: Try to deal with Sun3/50 SCSI DMA hardware bug

[kernel/hp300]: Fix incorrect value in HP-IB command stream.

[kernel/sparc]: Fix panic if more than one framebuffer is found
on a sun4 system.

[kernel/sparc]: Fix oversight that caused rconsole to not attach to
cgsix-based consoles.

[kernel/hp300]: Fix integer overflow in page table map allocation that
could cause systems to hang during fork().

[user/generic]: Fix rarpd so that it only opens one BPF per interface 
and not per address. Fixes problem where interface aliases caused 
rarpd to open extra BPF's.

[kernel/i386]: Fix register constraints so gcc-2.7.2 can be used to
build kernels.

[amiga]: Fix documentation about CPU support: we don't support 68060, only
68020, 68030 and 68040.

[kernel/amiga]: Fix a problem with the A2410 driver on fast CPUs and another
one which caused it to reject the last monitor definition.
