This file describes official patches for the NetBSD 1.2 release.

Mondo patch 1:

[ kernel/alpha ] Fix several SCSI protocol errors in the "esp" driver.

[ kernel/sparc ] Fix several SCSI protocol errors in the "esp" driver.

[ kernel/netinet ] Fix handling of long IP packets; no longer succeptible
to the "Windows 95 death ping" bug.

[ netstat(1) ] Display the `toolong' IP stat count, corresponding to
netinet change above.

[ kernel/scsi ] For ioctl commands which may change the device's state,
ensure the caller has the device open for writing (security precaution).

[ lpd(8) ] Fix some errors in the lpd(8) manual page.

[ eeprom(1) ] Discard setgid privileges if we don't need them.

[ kernel/hp300 ] Make sure clock interrupts are disabled at the
end of the delay calibration routine.  Fixes a bug where the kernel
would get a bad pointer reference and crash very early in kernels
without DDB.

[ mt(1) ] Don't attempt to set TCP_MAXSEG for remote mt.

[ kernel/scsi ] In the sd driver, start a mode sense with a clean
sense buffer.

[ kernel/alpha ] Fix race condition in tcds interrupt code.

[ distrib/amiga ] Add missing hardware items to release notes.

[ mountd(8) ] Fix two critical bugs on NetBSD/alpha.

[ kernel/atari ] Fix AHDI badsector list handling.

[ kernel/atari ] Add lpt0 driver to fix undefined symbols.

[ kernel/pmax ] Add initialization of SYSV IPC/SHM/semaphores.

[ kernel/pmax ] Add call to doshutdownhooks().

[ kernel/pmax ] Fix typo in pmax debug code (pr #2739).

[ kernel/pmax ] Fix data corruption bug in asc SCSI driver.

[ kernel/pmax ] Fix semantic confusion between SIGBUS and SIGSEGV.

[ kernel/alpha ] Fix PPP netisr handling.

[ kernel/mac68k ] Fix output interrupt race condtion in zs driver.

[ kernel/elf ] Deal with ELF executables with only one section.

[ kernel/amiga ] Fix m68881_save/restore() on 68060 machines.

[ kernel/atari ] Fix installboot version strings.

[ kernel/m68k ] Fix fmovem register naming in kernel disassembler.

[ kernel/m68k ] Fix error that prevented FPINCOS opcode emulation.

[ kernel/alpha ] Fix TurboChannel framebuffer detection code.

[ kernel/alpha ] Fix register access in SCC driver.

[ kernel/amiga ] Fix spurious interrupt in ARCnet driver.

[ kernel/generic ] Fix infinite loop bug in shutdown code.
