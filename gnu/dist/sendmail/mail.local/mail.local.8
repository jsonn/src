.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mail.local
.RB [ \-7 "] [" \-b "] [" \-d "] [" \-l "] [" \-f
.IR from "] "
.RB [ \-r 
.IR from "] " "user ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mail.local
reads the standard input up to an end-of-file and appends it to each
.I user's
.B mail 
file.  The
.I user
must be a valid user name.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 1i
.B \-7
Do not advertise 8BITMIME support in LMTP mode.
.TP 
.B \-b
Return a permanent error instead of a temporary error
if a mailbox exceeds quota.
.TP 
.B \-d
Specify this is a delivery (for backward compatibility).
.TP 
.BI \-f " from"
Specify the sender's name.
.TP
.B \-l
Turn on LMTP mode.
.TP 
.BI \-r " from"
Specify the sender's name (for backward compatibility).
.PP
Individual mail messages in the mailbox are delimited by an empty
line followed by a line beginning with the string ``From ''.
A line containing the string ``From '', the sender's name and a time stamp
is prepended to each delivered mail message.
A blank line is appended to each message.
A greater-than character (``>'') is prepended to any line in the message
which could be mistaken for a ``From '' delimiter line
(that is,
a line beginning with the five characters
``From '' following a blank line).
.PP
The mail files are exclusively locked with 
flock(2) 
while mail is appended, 
and a
.B user.lock
file also is created while the mailbox is locked 
for compatibility with older MUAs.
.PP
If the ``biff'' service is returned by 
getservbyname(3), 
the biff server is notified of delivered mail.
.PP
The
.B mail.local
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP TZ
Used to set the appropriate time zone on the timestamp.

(handling mailbox reading as well as mail delivery)
appeared in
