       MMaaiill..llooccaall reads the standard input up to  an  end-of-file
       and appends it to each _u_s_e_r_'_s mmaaiill file.  The _u_s_e_r must be
       a valid user name.

       The options are as follows:

       --77        Do not advertise 8BITMIME support in LMTP  mode.

       --bb        Return  a permanent error instead of a temporary
                 error if a mailbox exceeds quota.

       --dd        Specify this is a delivery (for backward compat-
                 ibility).

       --ff _f_r_o_m   Specify the sender's name.

       --ll        Turn on LMTP mode.

       --rr _f_r_o_m   Specify the sender's name (for backward compati-
                 bility).

       Individual mail messages in the mailbox are  delimited  by
       an empty line followed by a line beginning with the string
       ``From ''.  A line containing the string  ``From  '',  the
       sender's name and a time stamp is prepended to each deliv-
       ered mail message.  A blank line is appended to each  mes-
       sage.   A  greater-than  character (``>'') is prepended to
       any line in the message which  could  be  mistaken  for  a
       ``From  ''  delimiter line (that is, a line beginning with
       the five characters ``From '' following a blank line).

       The mail files are exclusively locked with flock(2)  while
       mail  is  appended,  and  a uusseerr..lloocckk file also is created
       while the mailbox is locked for compatibility  with  older
       MUAs.

       If  the  ``biff'' service is returned by getservbyname(3),
       the biff server is notified of delivered mail.

       The mmaaiill..llooccaall utility exits 0 on success, and  >0  if  an
       error occurs.

       mmaaiill..llooccaall  escapes  only  "^From  "  lines that follow an
       empty line.  If all lines starting with "From " should  be
       escaped,  use  the  'E'  flag  for the local mailer in the
       sendmail.cf file.

       A superset of mmaaiill..llooccaall (handling mailbox reading as well
       as  mail  delivery) appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX as the
       program mmaaiill.
