SYNOPSIS

	static void solib_map_sections (struct so_list *so)

DESCRIPTION

	Given a pointer to one of the shared objects in our list
	of mapped objects, use the recorded name to open a bfd
	descriptor for the object, build a section table, and then
	relocate all the section addresses by the base address at
	which the shared object was mapped.

FIXMES

	In most (all?) cases the shared object file name recorded in the
	dynamic linkage tables will be a fully qualified pathname.  For
	cases where it isn't, do we really mimic the systems search
	mechanism correctly in the below code (particularly the tilde

LOCAL FUNCTION

	locate_base -- locate the base address of dynamic linker structs

SYNOPSIS

	CORE_ADDR locate_base (void)

DESCRIPTION

	For both the SunOS and SVR4 shared library implementations, if the
	inferior executable has been linked dynamically, there is a single
	address somewhere in the inferior's data space which is the key to
	locating all of the dynamic linker's runtime structures.  This
	address is the value of the debug base symbol.  The job of this
	function is to find and return that address, or to return 0 if there
	is no such address (the executable is statically linked for example).

	For SunOS, the job is almost trivial, since the dynamic linker and
	all of it's structures are statically linked to the executable at
	link time.  Thus the symbol for the address we are looking for has
	already been added to the minimal symbol table for the executable's
	objfile at the time the symbol file's symbols were read, and all we
	have to do is look it up there.  Note that we explicitly do NOT want
	to find the copies in the shared library.

	The SVR4 version is a bit more complicated because the address
	is contained somewhere in the dynamic info section.  We have to go
	to a lot more work to discover the address of the debug base symbol.
	Because of this complexity, we cache the value we find and return that
	value on subsequent invocations.  Note there is no copy in the
	executable symbol tables.

LOCAL FUNCTION

	enable_break -- arrange for dynamic linker to hit breakpoint

SYNOPSIS

	int enable_break (void)

DESCRIPTION

	Both the SunOS and the SVR4 dynamic linkers have, as part of their
	debugger interface, support for arranging for the inferior to hit
	a breakpoint after mapping in the shared libraries.  This function
	enables that breakpoint.

	For SunOS, there is a special flag location (in_debugger) which we
	set to 1.  When the dynamic linker sees this flag set, it will set
	a breakpoint at a location known only to itself, after saving the
	original contents of that place and the breakpoint address itself,
	in it's own internal structures.  When we resume the inferior, it
	will eventually take a SIGTRAP when it runs into the breakpoint.
	We handle this (in a different place) by restoring the contents of
	the breakpointed location (which is only known after it stops),
	chasing around to locate the shared libraries that have been
	loaded, then resuming.

	For SVR4, the debugger interface structure contains a member (r_brk)
	which is statically initialized at the time the shared library is
	built, to the offset of a function (_r_debug_state) which is guaran-
	teed to be called once before mapping in a library, and again when
	the mapping is complete.  At the time we are examining this member,
	it contains only the unrelocated offset of the function, so we have
	to do our own relocation.  Later, when the dynamic linker actually
	runs, it relocates r_brk to be the actual address of _r_debug_state().

	The debugger interface structure also contains an enumeration which
	is set to either RT_ADD or RT_DELETE prior to changing the mapping,
	depending upon whether or not the library is being mapped or unmapped,
	and then set to RT_CONSISTENT after the library is mapped/unmapped.

GLOBAL FUNCTION
  
	solib_create_inferior_hook -- shared library startup support
  
SYNOPSIS
  
	void solib_create_inferior_hook()
  
DESCRIPTION
  
	When gdb starts up the inferior, it nurses it along (through the
	shell) until it is ready to execute it's first instruction.  At this
	point, this function gets called via expansion of the macro
	SOLIB_CREATE_INFERIOR_HOOK.

	For SunOS executables, this first instruction is typically the
	one at "_start", or a similar text label, regardless of whether
	the executable is statically or dynamically linked.  The runtime
	startup code takes care of dynamically linking in any shared
	libraries, once gdb allows the inferior to continue.

	For SVR4 executables, this first instruction is either the first
	instruction in the dynamic linker (for dynamically linked
	executables) or the instruction at "start" for statically linked
	executables.  For dynamically linked executables, the system
	first exec's /lib/libc.so.N, which contains the dynamic linker,
	and starts it running.  The dynamic linker maps in any needed
	shared libraries, maps in the actual user executable, and then
	jumps to "start" in the user executable.

	For both SunOS shared libraries, and SVR4 shared libraries, we
	can arrange to cooperate with the dynamic linker to discover the
	names of shared libraries that are dynamically linked, and the
	base addresses to which they are linked.

	This function is responsible for discovering those names and
	addresses, and saving sufficient information about them to allow
	their symbols to be read at a later time.

FIXME

	Between enable_break() and disable_break(), this code does not
	properly handle hitting breakpoints which the user might have
	set in the startup code or in the dynamic linker itself.  Proper
	handling will probably have to wait until the implementation is
	changed to use the "breakpoint handler function" method.

	Also, what if child has exit()ed?  Must exit loop somehow.

LOCAL FUNCTION

	special_symbol_handling -- additional shared library symbol handling

SYNOPSIS

	void special_symbol_handling (struct so_list *so)

DESCRIPTION

	Once the symbols from a shared object have been loaded in the usual
	way, we are called to do any system specific symbol handling that 
	is needed.

	For SunOS4, this consists of grunging around in the dynamic
	linkers structures to find symbol definitions for "common" symbols
	and adding them to the minimal symbol table for the runtime common
	objfile.
