/* On the sun3 the kernel pushes a sigcontext on the user stack and then
   `calls' _sigtramp in user code. _sigtramp saves the floating point status
   on the stack and calls the signal handler function. The stack does not
   contain enough information to allow a normal backtrace, but sigcontext
   contains the saved user pc/sp. FRAME_CHAIN and friends in tm-m68k.h and
   m68k_find_saved_regs deal with this situation by manufacturing a fake frame
   for _sigtramp.
   SIG_PC_FP_OFFSET is the offset from the signal handler frame to the
   saved pc in sigcontext.
   SIG_SP_FP_OFFSET is the offset from the signal handler frame to the end
   of sigcontext which is identical to the saved sp at SIG_PC_FP_OFFSET - 4.

   Please note that it is impossible to correctly backtrace from a breakpoint
   in _sigtramp as _sigtramp modifies the stack pointer a few times.  */
