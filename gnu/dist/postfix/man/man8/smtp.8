Postfix SMTP client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBsmtp\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix SMTP client processes message delivery requests from
the queue manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender
address, a domain or host to deliver to, and recipient information.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The SMTP client updates the queue file and marks recipients
as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should
be tried again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent
to the \fBbounce\fR(8), \fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon as
appropriate.

The SMTP client looks up a list of mail exchanger addresses for
the destination host, sorts the list by preference, and connects
to each listed address until it finds a server that responds.

When a server is not reachable, or when mail delivery fails due
to a recoverable error condition, the SMTP client will try to
deliver the mail to an alternate host.

After a successful mail transaction, a connection may be saved
to the \fBscache\fR(8) connection cache server, so that it
may be used by any SMTP client for a subsequent transaction.

By default, connection caching is enabled temporarily for
destinations that have a high volume of mail in the active
queue. Session caching can be enabled permanently for
specific destinations.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The SMTP client is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to SMTP
servers and to DNS servers on the network. The SMTP client can be
run chrooted at fixed low privilege.
.SH "STANDARDS"

RFC 821 (SMTP protocol)
RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
Corrupted message files are marked so that the queue manager can
move them to the \fBcorrupt\fR queue for further inspection.

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces, protocol problems, and of
other trouble.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
SMTP connection caching does not work with TLS. The necessary
support for TLS object passivation and re-activation does not
exist without closing the session, which defeats the purpose.

SMTP connection caching assumes that SASL credentials are valid for
all destinations that map onto the same IP address and TCP port.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically, as \fBsmtp\fR(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
