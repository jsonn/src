Postfix local delivery via LMTP
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na
.nf
\fBlmtp\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The LMTP client processes message delivery requests from
the queue manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender
address, a domain or host to deliver to, and recipient information.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The LMTP client updates the queue file and marks recipients
as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery should
be tried again at a later time. Delivery status reports are sent
to the \fBbounce\fR(8), \fBdefer\fR(8) or \fBtrace\fR(8) daemon as
appropriate.

The LMTP client connects to the destination specified in the message
delivery request. The destination, usually specified in the Postfix
\fBtransport\fR(5) table, has the form:
.IP \fBunix\fR:\fIpathname\fR
Connect to the local UNIX-domain server that is bound to the specified
\fIpathname\fR. If the process runs chrooted, an absolute pathname
is interpreted relative to the changed root directory.
.IP "\fBinet\fR:\fIhost\fR, \fBinet\fB:\fIhost\fR:\fIport\fR (symbolic host)"
.IP "\fBinet\fR:[\fIaddr\fR], \fBinet\fR:[\fIaddr\fR]:\fIport\fR (numeric host)"
Connect to the specified IPv4 TCP port on the specified local or
remote host. If no port is specified, connect to the port defined as
\fBlmtp\fR in \fBservices\fR(5).
If no such service is found, the \fBlmtp_tcp_port\fR configuration
parameter (default value of 24) will be used.

The LMTP client does not perform MX (mail exchanger) lookups since
those are defined only for mail delivery via SMTP.
.PP
If neither \fBunix:\fR nor \fBinet:\fR are specified, \fBinet:\fR
is assumed.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The LMTP client is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to LMTP
servers and to DNS servers on the network. The LMTP client can be
run chrooted at fixed low privilege.
.SH "STANDARDS"

.nf
RFC 821 (SMTP protocol)
RFC 1651 (SMTP service extensions)
RFC 1652 (8bit-MIME transport)

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
Corrupted message files are marked so that the queue manager can
move them to the \fBcorrupt\fR queue for further inspection.

Depending on the setting of the \fBnotify_classes\fR parameter,
the postmaster is notified of bounces, protocol problems, and of
other trouble.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up automatically, as \fBlmtp\fR(8)
processes run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBlmtp_skip_quit_response (no)\fR"
Wait for the response to the LMTP QUIT command.
.SH "TROUBLE SHOOTING CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBdebug_peer_level (2)\fR"
The increment in verbose logging level when a remote client or
server matches a pattern in the debug_peer_list parameter.
.IP "\fBdebug_peer_list (empty)\fR"
Optional list of remote client or server hostname or network
address patterns that cause the verbose logging level to increase
by the amount specified in $debug_peer_level.
.IP "\fBerror_notice_recipient (postmaster)\fR"
The recipient of postmaster notifications about mail delivery
problems that are caused by policy, resource, software or protocol
errors.
.IP "\fBnotify_classes (resource, software)\fR"
The list of error classes that are reported to the postmaster.
.SH "EXTERNAL CONTENT INSPECTION CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
Available in Postfix version 2.1 and later:
.IP "\fBlmtp_send_xforward_command (no)\fR"
Send an XFORWARD command to the LMTP server when the LMTP LHLO
server response announces XFORWARD support.
.SH "SASL AUTHENTICATION CONTROLS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP "\fBlmtp_sasl_auth_enable (no)\fR"
Enable SASL authentication in the Postfix LMTP client.
.IP "\fBlmtp_sasl_password_maps (empty)\fR"
Optional LMTP client lookup tables with one username:password entry
per host or domain.
.IP "\fBlmtp_sasl_security_options (noplaintext, noanonymous)\fR"
What authentication mechanisms the Postfix LMTP client is allowed
to use.
.SH "RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS"
.na

In the text below, \fItransport\fR is the name
of the service as specified in the \fBmaster.cf\fR file.
.IP "\fBlmtp_cache_connection (yes)\fR"
Keep Postfix LMTP client connections open for up to $max_idle
seconds.
.IP "\fItransport_\fBdestination_concurrency_limit ($default_destination_concurrency_limit)\fR"
Limit the number of parallel deliveries to the same destination
via this mail delivery transport.
.IP "\fItransport_\fBdestination_recipient_limit ($default_destination_recipient_limit)\fR"
Limit the number of recipients per message delivery via this mail
delivery transport.

This parameter becomes significant if the LMTP client is used
for local delivery.  Some LMTP servers can optimize delivery of
the same message to multiple recipients. The default limit for
local mail delivery is 1.

Setting this parameter to 0 will lead to an unbounded number of
recipients per delivery.  However, this could be risky since it may
make the machine vulnerable to running out of resources if messages
are encountered with an inordinate number of recipients.  Exercise
care when setting this parameter.
.IP "\fBlmtp_connect_timeout (0s)\fR"
The LMTP client time limit for completing a TCP connection, or
zero (use the operating system built-in time limit).
.IP "\fBlmtp_lhlo_timeout (300s)\fR"

banner.
.IP "\fBlmtp_xforward_timeout (300s)\fR"
The LMTP client time limit for sending the XFORWARD command, and
for receiving the server response.
.IP "\fBlmtp_mail_timeout (300s)\fR"

for receiving the server response.
.IP "\fBlmtp_rcpt_timeout (300s)\fR"
