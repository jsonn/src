Postfix lookup table proxy server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.na

\fBproxymap\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server provides read-only table
lookup service to Postfix processes. The purpose
of the service is:
.IP \(bu
To overcome chroot restrictions. For example, a chrooted SMTP
server needs access to the system passwd file in order to
reject mail for non-existent local addresses, but it is not
practical to maintain a copy of the passwd file in the chroot
jail.  The solution:
.sp
.nf
local_recipient_maps =
    proxy:unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps
.fi
.IP \(bu
To consolidate the number of open lookup tables by sharing
one open table among multiple processes. For example, making
mysql connections from every Postfix daemon process results
in "too many connections" errors. The solution:
.sp
.nf
virtual_alias_maps =
    proxy:mysql:/etc/postfix/virtual_alias.cf
.fi
.sp
The total number of connections is limited by the number of
proxymap server processes.
.PP
The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server implements the following requests:
.IP "\fBopen\fR \fImaptype:mapname flags\fR"
Open the table with type \fImaptype\fR and name \fImapname\fR,
as controlled by \fIflags\fR. The reply includes the \fImaptype\fR
dependent flags (to distinguish a fixed string table from a regular
expression table).
.IP "\fBlookup\fR \fImaptype:mapname flags key\fR"
Look up the data stored under the requested key.
The reply is the request completion status code (below) and
the lookup result value.
The \fImaptype:mapname\fR and \fIflags\fR are the same
as with the \fBopen\fR request.
.PP
There is no \fBclose\fR command, nor are tables implicitly closed
when a client disconnects. The purpose is to share tables among
multiple client processes.
.SH "SERVER PROCESS MANAGEMENT"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
\fBproxymap\fR(8) servers run under control by the Postfix
\fBmaster\fR(8)
server.  Each server can handle multiple simultaneous connections.
When all servers are busy while a client connects, the \fBmaster\fR(8)
creates a new \fBproxymap\fR(8) server process, provided that the
process limit is not exceeded.
Each server terminates after serving at least \fB$max_use\fR clients
or after \fB$max_idle\fR seconds of idle time.
.SH "SECURITY"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server opens only tables that are approved via the
\fBproxy_read_maps\fR configuration parameter, does not talk to
users, and can run at fixed low privilege, chrooted or not.
However, running the proxymap server chrooted severely limits
usability, because it can open only chrooted tables.

The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server is not a trusted daemon process, and must
not be used to look up sensitive information such as user or
group IDs, mailbox file/directory names or external commands.

In Postfix version 2.2 and later, the proxymap client recognizes
requests to access a table for security-sensitive purposes,
and opens the table directly. This allows the same main.cf
setting to be used by sensitive and non-sensitive processes.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The \fBproxymap\fR(8) server provides service to multiple clients,
and must therefore not be used for tables that have high-latency
lookups.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
On busy mail systems a long time may pass before
\fBproxymap\fR(8) relevant
changes to \fBmain.cf\fR are picked up. Use the command
"\fBpostfix reload\fR" to speed up a change.

The text below provides only a parameter summary. See
\fBpostconf\fR(5) for more details including examples.
.IP "\fBconfig_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf
configuration files.
.IP "\fBdaemon_timeout (18000s)\fR"
How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a
request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.
.IP "\fBipc_timeout (3600s)\fR"
The time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal
communication channel.
.IP "\fBmax_idle (100s)\fR"
The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits
for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBmax_use (100)\fR"
The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon
process will service before terminating voluntarily.
.IP "\fBprocess_id (read-only)\fR"
The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBprocess_name (read-only)\fR"
The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.
.IP "\fBproxy_read_maps (see 'postconf -d' output)\fR"
The lookup tables that the \fBproxymap\fR(8) server is allowed to access.
