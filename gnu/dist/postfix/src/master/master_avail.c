/* NAME
/*	master_avail 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	Postfix master - process creation policy
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include "master.h"
/*
/*	void	master_avail_listen(serv)
/*	MASTER_SERV *serv;
/*
/*	void	master_avail_cleanup(serv)
/*	MASTER_SERV *serv;
/*
/*	void	master_avail_more(serv, proc)
/*	MASTER_SERV *serv;
/*	MASTER_PROC *proc;
/*
/*	void	master_avail_less(serv, proc)
/*	MASTER_SERV *serv;
/*	MASTER_PROC *proc;
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module implements the process creation policy. As long as
/*	the allowed number of processes for the given service is not
/*	exceeded, a connection request is either handled by an existing
/*	available process, or this module causes a new process to be
/*	created to service the request.
/*
/*	When the service runs out of process slots, a warning is logged.
/*	When the service is eligible for stress-mode operation, servers
/*	are restarted and new servers are created with stress mode enabled.
/*
/*	master_avail_listen() ensures that someone monitors the service's
/*	listen socket for connection requests (as long as resources
/*	to handle connection requests are available).  This function may
/*	be called at random. When the maximum number of servers is running,
/*	connection requests are left in the system queue.
/*
/*	master_avail_cleanup() should be called when the named service
/*	is taken out of operation. It terminates child processes by
/*	sending SIGTERM.
/*
/*	master_avail_more() should be called when the named process
/*	has become available for servicing new connection requests.
/*
/*	master_avail_less() should be called when the named process
/*	has become unavailable for servicing new connection requests.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Panic: internal inconsistencies.
/* BUGS
