<h2>Berkeley DB issues</h2>

<p> Warning: if you can't compile Postfix because the file "db.h"
isn't found, then you MUST install the Berkeley DB development
package (package name: db???-devel-???) that comes with your Linux
system. Only that package contains the files that correspond to the
Berkeley DB version that is used by the system library routines.
</p>

<p> DO NOT download some Berkeley DB version from the network.
Every Postfix program will dump core when it is built with a different
Berkeley DB version than the version that is used by the system
library routines.  See the DB_README file for further information.
</p>

<h2>Procmail issues</h2>

<p> On RedHat Linux 7.1 and later <b>procmail</b> no longer has
permission
to write the mail spool directory. Workaround: chmod 1777
/var/spool/mail.
</p>

<h2>Syslogd performance</h2>

<p> LINUX <b>syslogd</b> uses synchronous writes by default. Because
of this, <b>syslogd</b> can actually use more system resources than
Postfix.  To avoid such badness, disable synchronous mail logfile
writes by editing /etc/syslog.conf and by prepending a - to the
logfile name:  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/syslog.conf:
    mail.*                          -/var/log/mail.log
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Send a "<b>kill -HUP</b>" to the <b>syslogd</b> to make the
change effective.  </p>
