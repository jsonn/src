<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Postfix version 2.3 introduces support for the Sendmail version
8 Milter (mail filter) protocol. This protocol is used by applications
that run outside the MTA to inspect SMTP events (CONNECT, DISCONNECT),
SMTP commands (HELO, MAIL FROM, etc.) as well as mail content.  All
this happens before mail is queued.  </p>

<p> The reason for adding Milter support to Postfix is that there
exists a large collection of applications, not only to block unwanted
mail, but also to verify authenticity (examples: <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/">Domain keys
identified mail</a>, <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sid-milter/">SenderID+SPF</a> and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dk-milter/">Domain keys</a>)
or to digitally sign mail (examples: <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/">Domain keys
identified mail</a>, <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dk-milter/">Domain keys</a>).
Having yet another Postfix-specific version of all that software
is a poor use of human and system resources. </p>

<p> Postfix version 2.4 implements all the requests of Sendmail
version 8 Milter protocols up to version 4, including message body
replacement (body replacement is not available with Postfix version
2.3).
See, however, the <a href="#workarounds">workarounds</a> and <a
href="#limitations">limitations</a> sections at the end of this
document. </p>

<h2><a name="plumbing">How Milter applications plug into Postfix </a> </h2>

<p> The Postfix Milter implementation uses two different lists of
mail filters: one list of filters that are used for SMTP mail only,
and one list of filters that are used for non-SMTP mail. The two
lists have different capabilities, which is unfortunate.  Avoiding
this would require major restructuring of Postfix. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> The SMTP-only filters handle mail that arrives via the
Postfix smtpd(8) server. They are typically used to filter unwanted
mail and to sign mail from authorized SMTP clients. You specify
SMTP-only Milter applications with the smtpd_milters parameter as
described in a later section.  Mail that arrives via the Postfix
smtpd(8) server is not filtered by the non-SMTP filters that are
described next. </p>

<li> <p> The non-SMTP filters handle mail that arrives via the
Postfix sendmail(1) command-line or via the Postfix qmqpd(8) server.
They are typically used to digitally sign mail only. Although
non-SMTP filters can be used to filter unwanted mail, they have
limitations compared to the SMTP-only filters. You specify non-SMTP
Milter applications with the non_smtpd_milters parameter as described
in a later section.  </p>

</ul>

<p> For those who are familiar with the Postfix architecture, the
figure below shows how Milter applications plug into Postfix.  Names
followed by a number are Postfix commands or server programs, while
unnumbered names inside shaded areas represent Postfix queues.  To
avoid clutter, the path for local submission is simplified (the
OVERVIEW document has a more complete description).  </p>

<h2><a name="building">Building Milter applications</a></h2>

<p> Milter applications have been written in C, JAVA and Perl, but
this document deals with C applications only.   For these, you need
an object library that implements the Sendmail 8 Milter protocol.
Postfix currently does not provide such a library, but Sendmail
does. </p>

<p> On some Linux and *BSD distributions, the Sendmail libmilter
library is installed by default. With this, applications such as
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/">dkim-milter</a>
and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sid-milter/">sid-milter</a>
build out of the box without requiring any tinkering:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ <b>gzcat dkim-milter-<i>x.y.z</i>.tar.gz | tar xf -</b>
$ <b>cd dkim-milter-<i>x.y.z</i></b>
$ <b>make</b>
[...<i>lots of output omitted</i>...]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> On other platforms you have two options: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p>Install the Sendmail libmilter object library and include
files.  On Linux systems, libmilter may be provided by the
sendmail-devel package.  After installing libmilter, build the
Milter applications as described in the preceding paragraph.  </p>

<li> <p>Don't install the Sendmail libmilter library, but build the
library from Sendmail source code instead: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ <b>gzcat sendmail-<i>x.y.z</i>.tar.gz | tar xf -</b>
$ <b>cd sendmail-<i>x.y.z</i>/libmilter</b>
$ <b>make</b>
[...<i>lots of output omitted</i>...]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> After building your own libmilter library, follow the installation
instructions in the Milter application source distribution to specify
the location of the libmilter include files and object library.
Typically, these settings are configured in a file named
<tt>sid-filter/Makefile.m4</tt> or similar:

<blockquote>
<pre>
APPENDDEF(`confINCDIRS', `-I/some/where/sendmail-x.y.z/include')
APPENDDEF(`confLIBDIRS', `-L/some/where/sendmail-x.y.z/obj.<i>systemtype</i>/libmilter')
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Then build the Milter application. </p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="running">Running Milter applications</a></h2>

<p> To run a Milter application, see the documentation of the filter
for options.  A typical command looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# <b>/some/where/dkim-filter -u <i>userid</i> -p inet:<i>portnumber</i>@localhost ...<i>other options</i>...</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Please specify a <i>userid</i> value that isn't used for other
applications (not "postfix", not "www", etc.). </p>

<h2><a name="config">Configuring Postfix</a></h2>

<p> Like Sendmail, Postfix has a lot of configuration options that
control how it talks to Milter applications. With the initial Postfix
Milter protocol implementation, many options are global, that is,
they apply to all Milter applications. Future Postfix versions may
support per-Milter timeouts, per-Milter error handling, etc. </p>

<h3><a name="smtp-only-milters">SMTP-Only Milter applications</a></h3>

<p>  The SMTP-only Milter applications handle mail that arrives via
the Postfix smtpd(8) server. They are typically used to filter
unwanted mail, and to sign mail from authorized SMTP clients.  Mail
that arrives via the Postfix smtpd(8) server is not filtered by the
non-SMTP filters that are described in the next section. </p>

<p> NOTE: Do not use the header_checks(5) IGNORE action to remove
Postfix's own Received: message header. This causes problems with
mail signing filters. Instead, keep Postfix's own Received: message
header and use the header_checks(5) REPLACE action to sanitize
information. </p>

<p> You specify SMTP-only Milter applications (there can be more
than one) with the smtpd_milters parameter.  Each Milter application
is identified by the name of its listening socket; other Milter
configuration options will be discussed in later sections.  Milter
applications are applied in the order as specified, and the first
Milter application that rejects a command will override the responses
from other Milter applications.  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    # Milters for mail that arrives via the smtpd(8) server.
    # See below for socket address syntax.
    smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:<i>portnumber</i> ...<i>other filters</i>...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The general syntax for listening sockets is as follows: </p>

<blockquote>

<dl>

<dt> <b>unix:</b><i>pathname</i> </dt> <dd><p>Connect to the local
UNIX-domain server that is bound to the specified pathname. If the
smtpd(8) or cleanup(8) process runs chrooted, an absolute pathname
is interpreted relative to the Postfix queue directory.</p> </dd>

<dt> <b> inet:</b><i>host</i><b>:</b><i>port</i> </dt> <dd> <p>
Connect to the specified TCP port on the specified local or remote
host.  The host and port can be specified in numeric or symbolic
form.</p>

<p> NOTE: Postfix syntax differs from Milter syntax which has the
form <b>inet:</b><i>port</i><b>@</b><i>host</i>. </p>  </dd>

</dl>

</blockquote>

<h3> <a name="non-smtp-milters">Non-SMTP Milter applications </a> </h3>

<p> The non-SMTP Milter applications handle mail that arrives via
the Postfix sendmail(1) command-line or via the Postfix qmqpd(8)
server. They are typically used to digitally sign mail. Although
non-SMTP filters can be used to filter unwanted mail, there are
limitations as discussed later in this section.  Mail that arrives
via the Postfix smtpd(8) server is not filtered by the non-SMTP
filters.  </p>

<p> NOTE: Do not use the header_checks(5) IGNORE action to remove
Postfix's own Received: message header. This causes problems with
mail signing filters. Instead, keep Postfix's own Received: message
header and use the header_checks(5) REPLACE action to sanitize
information. </p>

<p> You specify non-SMTP Milter applications with the non_smtpd_milters
parameter. This parameter uses the same syntax as the smtpd_milters
parameter in the previous section. As with the SMTP-only filters,
you can specify more than one Milter application; they are applied
in the order as specified, and the first Milter application that
rejects a command will override the responses from the other
applications.  </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    # Milters for non-SMTP mail.
    # See below for socket address syntax.
    non_smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:<i>portnumber</i> ...<i>other filters</i>...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> There's one small complication when using Milter applications
for non-SMTP mail: there is no SMTP session.  To keep Milter
applications happy, the Postfix cleanup(8) server actually has to
simulate the SMTP client CONNECT and DISCONNECT events, and the
SMTP client EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO and DATA commands. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> When new mail arrives via the sendmail(1) command line,
the Postfix cleanup(8) server pretends that the mail arrives with
ESMTP from "localhost" with IP address "127.0.0.1". The result is
very similar to what happens with command line submissions in
Sendmail version 8.12 and later, although Sendmail uses a different
mechanism to achieve this result.  </p>

<li> <p> When new mail arrives via the qmqpd(8) server, the Postfix
cleanup(8) server pretends that the mail arrives with ESMTP, and
uses the QMQPD client hostname and IP address. </p>

<li> <p> When old mail is re-injected into the queue with "postsuper
-r", the Postfix cleanup(8) server uses the same client information
that was used when the mail arrived as new mail. </p>

</ul>

<p> This generally works as expected, with only one exception:
non-SMTP filters must not REJECT or TEMPFAIL simulated RCPT TO
commands.  When a non_smtpd_milters application REJECTs or TEMPFAILs
a recipient, Postfix will report a configuration error, and mail
will stay in the queue.  </p>

<p> None of this is a problem for mail filters that digitally sign
mail. </p>

<h3><a name="errors">Milter error handling</a></h3>

<p> The milter_default_action parameter specifies how Postfix handles
Milter application errors. The default action is to respond with a
temporary error status, so that the client will try again later.
Specify "accept" if you want to receive mail as if the filter does
not exist, and "reject" to reject mail with a permanent status.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
    # What to do in case of errors? Specify accept, reject, or tempfail.
    milter_default_action = tempfail
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="version">Milter protocol version</a></h3>

<p> As Postfix is not built with the Sendmail libmilter library,
you may need to configure the Milter protocol version that Postfix
should use.  The default version is 2. </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
milter_protocol = 2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> If the Postfix milter_protocol setting specifies a too low
version, the libmilter library will log an error message like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>application name</i>: st_optionneg[<i>xxxxx</i>]: 0x<i>yy</i> does not fulfill action requirements 0x<i>zz</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The remedy is to increase the Postfix milter_protocol version
number.  See, however, the <a href="#limitations">limitations</a>
section below for features that aren't supported by Postfix. </p>

<p> If the Postfix milter_protocol setting specifies a too high
version, the libmilter library simply hangs up without logging a
warning, and you see a Postfix warning message like one of the
following: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
postfix/smtpd[21045]: warning: milter inet:<i>host</i>:<i>port</i>: can't read packet header: Unknown error : 0
postfix/cleanup[15190]: warning: milter inet:<i>host</i>:<i>port</i>: can't read packet header: Success
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The remedy is to lower the Postfix milter_protocol version
number. </p>

<h3><a name="timeouts">Milter protocol timeouts</a></h3>

<p> Postfix uses different time limits at different Milter protocol
stages. The table shows wich timeouts are used and when
(EOH = end of headers; EOM = end of message).  </p>

<blockquote>

<table border="1">

<tr> <th> Parameter </th> <th> Time limit </th> <th> Protocol
stage</th> </tr>

<tr> <td> milter_connect_timeout </td> <td> 30s </td> <td> CONNECT
</td> </tr>

<tr> <td> milter_command_timeout </td> <td> 30s </td> <td> HELO,
MAIL, RCPT, DATA, UNKNOWN </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> milter_content_timeout </td> <td> 300s </td> <td> HEADER,
EOH, BODY, EOM </td> </tr>

</table>

</blockquote>

<p> Beware: 30s is not a lot for applications that do a lot of DNS
lookups.  However, if you increase the above timeouts too much,
remote SMTP clients may hang up and mail may be delivered multiple
times. This is an inherent problem with before-queue filtering. </p>

<h3><a name="macros">Sendmail macro emulation</a></h3>

<p> Postfix emulates a limited number of Sendmail macros, as shown
in the table. Different macros are available at different SMTP
protocol stages (EOM = end-of-message); their availability is not
always the same as in Sendmail. See the <a
href="#workarounds">workarounds</a> section below for solutions.
</p>

<blockquote>

<table border="1">

<tr> <th> Name </th> <th> Availability </th> <th> Description </th>

</table>

</blockquote>

<p> Postfix sends specific sets of macros at different SMTP protocol
stages.  The sets are configured with the parameters as described
in the table (EOM = end of message). </p>

<blockquote>

<table border="1">

<tr> <th> Parameter name </th> <th> Protocol version </th> <th>
Protocol stage </th> </tr>

<tr> <td> milter_connect_macros </td> <td> 2 or higher </td> <td>

<tr> <td> milter_helo_macros </td> <td> 2 or higher </td> <td>
HELO/EHLO </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> milter_mail_macros </td> <td> 2 or higher </td> <td> MAIL

<tr> <td> milter_rcpt_macros </td> <td> 2 or higher </td> <td> RCPT

<tr> <td> milter_data_macros </td> <td> 4 or higher </td> <td> DATA
</td> </tr>

<tr> <td> milter_end_of_data_macros </td> <td> 2 or higher </td>
<td> EOM </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> milter_unknown_command_macros </td> <td> 3 or higher </td>
<td> unknown command </td> </tr>

</table>

</blockquote>

<h2><a name="workarounds">Workarounds</a></h2>

<p> Content filters may break domain key etc. signatures. If you
use an SMTP-based content filter, then you should add a line to
master.cf with "-o disable_mime_output_conversion=yes" (note: no
spaces around the "="), as described in the <a
href="FILTER_README.html#advanced_filter">advanced content filter</a>
example. </p>

<p> Sendmail Milter applications were originally developed for the
Sendmail version 8 MTA, which has a different architecture than
Postfix.  The result is that some Milter applications make assumptions
that aren't true in a Postfix environment. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Some Milter applications use the "<tt>{if_addr}</tt>" macro
to recognize local mail; this macro does not exist in Postfix.
Workaround: use the "<tt>{client_addr}</tt>" macro instead. </p>

<li> <p> Some Milter applications log a warning that looks like
this: </p>

<blockquote> <pre>
sid-filter[36540]: WARNING: sendmail symbol 'i' not available
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> And they may insert a message header with "unknown-msgid" like
this: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
X-SenderID: Sendmail Sender-ID Filter vx.y.z host.example.com &lt;unknown-msgid&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> This happens because those Milter applications expect that the
queue ID is known <i>before</i> the MTA accepts the MAIL FROM
(sender) command.  Postfix, on the other hand, does not choose a
queue file name until <i>after</i> it accepts the first valid RCPT
TO (recipient) command (Postfix queue file names must be unique
across multiple directories, so the name can't be chosen before the
file is created; if multiple messages were to use the same queue
ID <i>simultaneously</i>, mail would be lost).  </p>

</ul>

<p> If you experience the ugly header problem, see if a recent
version of the Milter application fixes it. For example, current
versions of dkim-filter and dk-filter already have code that looks
up the Postfix queue ID at a later protocol stage. </p>

<p> To fix the ugly message header with sid-filter applications,
we change the source code, so that it does the queue ID lookup after
Postfix receives the end of the message. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Edit the filter source file (named
<tt>sid-filter/sid-filter.c</tt>). </p>

<li> <p> Look up the <tt>smfilter</tt> table and replace
<tt>mlfi_eoh</tt> by <tt>NULL</tt>.
</p>

<li> <p> Look up the <tt>mlfi_eom()</tt> function and add code near
the top that calls <tt>mlfi_eoh()</tt> as shown by the <b>bold</b>
text below: </p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<pre>
        assert(ctx != NULL);
#endif /* !DEBUG */
<b>
        ret = mlfi_eoh(ctx);
        if (ret != SMFIS_CONTINUE)
                return ret;</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> NOTES: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> This was tested with sid-milter-0.2.10 and sid-milter-0.2.14. </p>

</ul>

<p> To fix the ugly message header with other Milter applications,
you will need to do something like this: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Edit the filter source file (typically named
<tt>xxx-filter/xxx-filter.c</tt> or similar). </p>

<li> <p> Look up the <tt>mlfi_eom()</tt> function and add code near
the top shown as <b>bold</b> text below: </p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
<pre>
dfc = cc->cctx_msg;
assert(dfc != NULL);
<b>
/* Determine the job ID for logging. */
if (dfc->mctx_jobid == 0 || strcmp(dfc->mctx_jobid, JOBIDUNKNOWN) == 0) {
        char *jobid = smfi_getsymval(ctx, "i");
        if (jobid != 0)
                dfc->mctx_jobid = jobid;
}</b>

/* get hostname; used in the X header and in new MIME boundaries */
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> NOTES: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Different mail filters use slightly different names for
variables. If the above code does not compile, look for the code
at the start of the <tt>mlfi_eoh()</tt> routine. </p>

<li> <p> This fixes only the ugly message header, but not the WARNING
message.  Fortunately, many Milters log that message only once. </p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>

<p> This section lists limitations of the Postfix Milter implementation.
Some limitations will be removed as the implementation is extended
over time. Of course the usual limitations of before-queue filtering
will always apply. See the CONTENT_INSPECTION_README document for
a discussion. </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> Postfix currently supports only applications that speak
the Sendmail 8 Milter protocol versions 2..4. Support for other
protocol types or protocol versions may be added later. </p>

<li> <p> For applications that are written in C, you need to use
the Sendmail libmilter library. A Postfix replacement may be 
provided in the future. </p>

<li> <p> There are TWO sets of mail filters: filters that are used
for SMTP mail only (specified with the smtpd_milters parameter),
and filters for non-SMTP mail (specified with the non_smtpd_milters
parameter).  The non-SMTP filters are primarily for local submissions.
</p>

<li> <p> When mail is filtered by non-SMTP filters, the Postfix
cleanup(8) server has to simulate the SMTP client CONNECT and
DISCONNECT events, and the SMTP client EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO and
DATA commands.  This works as expected, with only one exception:
non-SMTP filters must not REJECT or TEMPFAIL simulated RCPT TO
commands.  When a non-SMTP filter REJECTs or TEMPFAILs a recipient,
Postfix will report a configuration error, and mail will stay in
the queue.  </p>

<li> <p> Postfix currently does not apply content filters to mail
that is forwarded or aliased internally, or to mail that is generated
internally such as bounces or Postmaster notifications. This may
be a problem when you want to apply a signing Milter to such mail.
</p>

<li> <p> When you use the before-queue content filter for incoming
SMTP mail (see SMTPD_PROXY_README), Milter applications have access
only to the SMTP command information; they have no access to the
message header or body, and cannot make modifications to the message
or to the envelope. </p>

<li> <p> Postfix 2.3 does not support Milter requests to replace
the message body. Milter applications that request this unsupported
operation will log a warning like this: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>application name</i>: st_optionneg[134563840]: 0x3d does not fulfill action requirements 0x1e
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> The solution is to use Postfix version 2.4 or later. </p>
