<h2>WARNING </h2>

<p> The before-queue content filtering feature described in
this document is suitable only for low-traffic sites. See the "<a
href="#pros_cons">Pros and Cons</a>" section below for details.
</p>

<h2>The Postfix before-queue content filter feature</h2>

<p> As of version 2.1, the Postfix SMTP server can forward all
incoming mail to a content filtering proxy server that inspects
all mail BEFORE it is stored in the Postfix mail queue. </p>

<p> The before-queue content filter is meant to be used as follows: </p>

<p> The before-queue content filter is not to be confused with the
approach described in the <a href="FILTER_README.html">FILTER_README</a> document, where mail is
filtered AFTER it is stored in the Postfix mail queue. </p>

<p> This document describes the following topics: </p>

<ul>

<li><a href="#principles">Principles of operation</a>

<li><a href="#pros_cons">Pros and cons of before-queue content filtering</a>

<li><a href="#config">Configuring the Postfix SMTP pass-through
proxy feature</a>

<li><a href="#parameters">Configuration parameters</a>

<li><a href="#protocol">How Postfix talks to the before-queue content
filter</a>

<li><a href="#transparency">Transparency</a>

</ul>

<h2><a name="principles">Principles of operation</a></h2>

<p> The before-filter Postfix SMTP server receives mail from the
Internet and does the usual relay access control, SASL authentication,
RBL lookups, rejecting non-existent sender or recipient addresses,
etc.  The before-queue filter receives unfiltered mail content from
Postfix and does one of the following:  </p>

<ol>

    <li> <p> Re-inject the mail back into Postfix via SMTP, perhaps
    after changing its content and/or destination. </p>

    <li> <p> Reject the mail by sending a suitable SMTP status code
    back to Postfix. Postfix passes the status back to the remote
    SMTP client. This way, Postfix does not have to send a bounce
    message. </p>

</ol>

<p>The after-filter Postfix SMTP server receives mail from the
content filter. From then on Postfix processes the mail as usual. </p>

<p> The before-queue content filter described here works just like
the after-queue content filter described in the <a href="FILTER_README.html">FILTER_README</a>
document. In many cases you can use the same software, within the
limitations as discussed in the "<a href="#pros_cons">Pros and
Cons</a>" section below. </p>

<h2><a name="pros_cons">Pros and cons of before-queue content
filtering</a></h2>

<ul>

<li> <p> Pro: Postfix can reject mail before the incoming SMTP mail
transfer completes, so that Postfix does not have to send rejected
mail back to the sender (which is usually forged anyway).  Mail
that is not accepted remains the responsibility of the remote SMTP
client. </p>

<li> <p> Con: The remote SMTP client expects an SMTP reply within
a deadline.  As the system load increases, fewer and fewer CPU
cycles remain available to answer within the deadline, and eventually
you either have to stop accepting mail or you have to stop filtering
mail. It is for this reason that the before-queue content filter
can be used only on low-traffic sites. </p>

<li> <p> Con: Content filtering software can use lots of memory
resources. In order to not run out of memory you have to reduce
the number of before-filter SMTP server processes so that a burst
of mail will not drive your system into the ground with too many
content filter processes. This, in turn, means that SMTP clients
have to wait for a long time before they receive service.  </p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="config">Configuring the Postfix SMTP pass-through
proxy feature</a></h2>

<p> In the following example, the before-filter Postfix SMTP server
gives mail to a content filter that listens on localhost port 10025.
The after-filter Postfix SMTP server receives mail from the content
filter via localhost port 10026. From then on mail is processed as
usual. </p>

<p> The content filter itself is not described here. You can use
any filter that is SMTP enabled. For non-SMTP capable content
filtering software, Bennett Todd's SMTP proxy implements a nice
PERL/SMTP content filtering framework. See:
<a href="http://bent.latency.net/smtpprox/">http://bent.latency.net/smtpprox/</a>. </p>

<p> Note: do not specify spaces around the "=" or "," characters. </p>

<p> The before-filter SMTP server entry is a modified version of the
default Postfix SMTP server entry that is normally configured at
the top of the master.cf file: </p>

<ul>

    <li> <p> The number of SMTP sessions is reduced from the default
    100 to only 20. This prevents a burst of mail from running your
    system into the ground with too many content filter processes. </p>

    <li> <p> The "-o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_client_connection_count_limit">smtpd_client_connection_count_limit</a>=10" prevents
    one SMTP client from using up all 20 SMTP server processes.
    This limit is not necessary if you receive all mail from a
    trusted relay host. </p>

    <p> Note: this setting is ignored by the stable Postfix 2.1
    release. The feature will be available only in the experimental
    release until Postfix 2.2.  </p>

    <li> <p> The "-o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_proxy_filter">smtpd_proxy_filter</a>=127.0.0.1:10025" tells the
    before filter SMTP server that it should give incoming mail to
    the content filter that listens on localhost port 10025. </p>

</ul>

<p> The after-filter SMTP server is a new master.cf entry: </p>

<ul>

    <li> <p> The "127.0.0.1:10026" makes the after-filter SMTP
    server listen
    on the localhost address only, without exposing it to the
    network.  NEVER expose the after-filter SMTP server to the
    Internet :-) </p>

    <li> <p> The "-o <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts">smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts</a>=127.0.0.0/8"
    allows the after-filter SMTP server to receive remote SMTP
    client information from the before filter SMTP server, so that
    the after-filter Postfix daemons log the remote SMTP client
    information instead of logging localhost[127.0.0.1]. </p>

    <li> <p> The other after-filter SMTP server settings avoid
    duplication of work that is already done in the "before filter"
    SMTP server. </p>

</ul>

<p> By default, the filter has 100 seconds to do its work. If it
takes longer then Postfix gives up and reports an error to the
remote SMTP client. You can increase this time limit (see configuration
parameter section below) but doing so is pointless because you
can't control when the remote SMTP client times out. </p>

<h2><a name="parameters">Configuration parameters</a></h2>

<p> Parameters that control proxying: </p>

<ul>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_proxy_filter">smtpd_proxy_filter</a> (syntax: host:port): The host and TCP
port of the before-queue content filter.  When no host or host:
is specified here, localhost is assumed. </p>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_proxy_timeout">smtpd_proxy_timeout</a> (default: 100s): Timeout for connecting
to the before-queue content filter and for sending and receiving
commands and data.  All proxy errors are logged to the maillog
file. For privacy reasons, all the remote SMTP client sees is "451
Error:  queue file write error". It would not be right to disclose
internal details to strangers. </p>

<li> <p> <a href="postconf.5.html#smtpd_proxy_ehlo">smtpd_proxy_ehlo</a> (default: $<a href="postconf.5.html#myhostname">myhostname</a>): The hostname to
use when sending an EHLO command to the before-queue content filter.
</p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="protocol">How Postfix talks to the before-queue content
filter</a></h2>

<p> The before-filter Postfix SMTP server connects to the content
filter, delivers one message, and disconnects.  While sending mail
into the content filter, Postfix speaks ESMTP but uses no command
pipelining.  Postfix generates its own EHLO, XFORWARD (for logging
the remote client IP address instead of localhost[127.0.0.1]), DATA
and QUIT commands, and forwards unmodified copies of all the MAIL
FROM and RCPT TO commands that the before-filter Postfix SMTP server
didn't reject itself.  The SMTP proxy server should accept the same
MAIL FROM and RCPT TO command syntax as the Postfix SMTP server.
Postfix sends no other SMTP commands. </p>

<p> The content filter is expected to pass on unmodified SMTP
commands from a before-filter Postfix SMTP server to an after-filter
Postfix SMTP server that usually listens on a non-standard port.
When the filter rejects content, it should send a negative SMTP
response back to the before-filter Postfix SMTP server, and it
should abort the connection with the after-filter Postfix SMTP
server without completing the SMTP conversation with the after-filter
Postfix SMTP server. </p>

<p> More detail on the postfix-to-proxy interaction is in the
section titled "<a href="#transparency">Transparency</a>". </p>

<h2><a name="transparency">Transparency</a></h2>

<p> The before-filter Postfix SMTP server forwards the MAIL FROM,
RCPT TO and DATA commands that it has approved, but it does not
forward other commands such as TLS or SASL commands.  It can
therefore not be transparent. </p>

<p> The real-time content filter, on the other hand, has to be
transparent.  In order to support non-transparent real-time content
filters, Postfix would have to reconcile the before-filter Postfix
ESMTP feature set with the feature set that Postfix receives from
the real-time content filter. </p>

<ul>

    <li> <p> When a future Postfix version supports DSN, but the
    content filter does not announce DSN support in the EHLO reply,
    then the before-filter SMTP server would have to either 1)
    suppress the DSN feature in its EHLO announcement, or 2)
    duplicate all the work that needs to be done when delivering
    DSN-aware mail to a non-DSN destination. </p>

    <li> <p> When the content filter does not announce 8BITMIME
    support in the EHLO reply, then the before-filter SMTP server
    would have to either 1) suppress the 8BITMIME feature in its
    EHLO announcement, or 2) convert the content to quoted-printable
    before giving it to the content filter. </p>

    <li> <p> Performance: when Postfix has to suppress elements
    from the before-filter EHLO reply because they are incompatible
    with the real-time content filter, then Postfix has to connect
    to the content filter as soon as the client sends a valid EHLO
    command.  This wastes a lot of resources when all the MAIL FROM
    or RCPT TO commands are rejected. </p>

</ul>

<p> Therefore, the Postfix SMTP server cannot be transparent with
respect to the before-queue content filter. </p>
