ANVIL(8)                                                              ANVIL(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       anvil - Postfix session count and request rate control

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>anvil</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  Postfix  <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server maintains short-term statis-
       tics to defend against clients that hammer a  server  with
       either  too  many  simultaneous sessions, or with too many
       successive requests within a configurable  time  interval.
       This  server is designed to run under control by the Post-
       fix <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> server.

       The <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a>  server  maintains  no  persistent  database.
       Standard library utilities do not meet Postfix performance
       and robustness requirements.

<b>CONNECTION COUNT/RATE LIMITING</b>
       When a remote client  connects,  a  connection  count  (or
       rate)  limited server should send the following request to
       the <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server:

           <b>request=connect</b>
           <b>ident=</b><i>string</i>

       This registers a new connection for the (service,  client)
       combination  specified  with  <b>ident</b>.  The  <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server
       answers with the number of  simultaneous  connections  and
       the number of connections per unit time for that (service,
       client) combination:

           <b>status=0</b>
           <b>count=</b><i>number</i>
           <b>rate=</b><i>number</i>

       The <b>rate</b> is computed as the  number  of  connections  that
       were  registered  in the current "time unit" interval.  It
       is left up to the server to decide if  the  remote  client
       exceeds the connection count (or rate) limit.

       When  a  remote client disconnects, a connection count (or
       rate) limited server should send the following request  to
       the <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server:

           <b>request=disconnect</b>
           <b>ident=</b><i>string</i>

       This  registers  a  disconnect  event  for  the  (service,
       client) combination specified  with  <b>ident</b>.  The  <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a>
       server replies with:

           <b>status=0</b>

<b>MESSAGE RATE LIMITING</b>
       When  a  remote client sends a message delivery request, a
       message rate limited  server  should  send  the  following
       request to the <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server:

           <b>request=message</b>
           <b>ident=</b><i>string</i>

       This  registers  a  message delivery request for the (ser-
       vice,  client)  combination  specified  with  <b>ident</b>.   The
       <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a>  server answers with the number of message deliv-
       ery requests per unit time for that (service, client) com-
       bination:

           <b>status=0</b>
           <b>rate=</b><i>number</i>

       In  order  to  prevent the <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server from discarding
       client request rates too early or too late, a message rate
       limited  service  should  also register connect/disconnect
       events.

<b>RECIPIENT RATE LIMITING</b>
       When a remote client sends a recipient address, a  recipi-
       ent  rate limited server should send the following request
       to the <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server:

           <b>request=recipient</b>
           <b>ident=</b><i>string</i>

       This registers  a  recipient  request  for  the  (service,
       client)  combination  specified  with  <b>ident</b>. The <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a>
       server answers with the number of recipient addresses  per
       unit time for that (service, client) combination:

           <b>status=0</b>
           <b>rate=</b><i>number</i>

       In  order  to  prevent the <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server from discarding
       client request rates too early or too  late,  a  recipient
       rate  limited service should also register connect/discon-
       nect events.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server does not talk to  the  network  or  to
       local  users, and can run chrooted at fixed low privilege.

       The <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a> server  maintains  an  in-memory  table  with
       information about recent clients of a connection count (or
       rate) limited service.  Although state is kept only tempo-
       rarily,  this  may require a lot of memory on systems that
       handle connections from many remote  clients.   To  reduce
       memory  usage,  reduce  the  time unit over which state is
       kept.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

       Upon exit, and every <b><a href="postconf.5.html#anvil_status_update_time">anvil_status_update_time</a></b> seconds, the
       server  logs  the  maximal count and rate values measured,
       together with (service, client) information and  the  time
       of  day  associated  with those events.  In order to avoid
       unnecessary overhead, no measurements are done for  activ-
       ity that isn't concurrency limited or rate limited.

<b>BUGS</b>
       Systems  behind  network  address  translating  routers or
       proxies appear to have the same client address and can run
       into connection count and/or rate limits falsely.

       In this preliminary implementation, a count (or rate) lim-
       ited server can have only one remote client at a time.  If
       a  server  reports  multiple simultaneous clients, all but
       the last reported client are ignored.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes to <b>main.cf</b> are picked up automatically as <a href="anvil.8.html"><b>anvil</b>(8)</a>
       processes  run  for only a limited amount of time. Use the
       command "<b>postfix reload</b>" to speed up a change.
