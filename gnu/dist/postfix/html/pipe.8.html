PIPE(8)                                                                PIPE(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       pipe - Postfix delivery to external command

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>pipe</b> [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <a href="pipe.8.html"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a>  daemon  processes  requests from the Postfix
       queue manager to deliver messages  to  external  commands.
       This  program expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process
       manager.

       Message  attributes  such  as  sender  address,  recipient
       address  and  next-hop  host name can be specified as com-
       mand-line macros that are  expanded  before  the  external
       command is executed.

       The  <a href="pipe.8.html"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a>  daemon updates queue files and marks recipi-
       ents as finished, or it informs  the  queue  manager  that
       delivery  should  be tried again at a later time. Delivery
       status reports are sent  to  the  <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a>,  <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a>  or
       <a href="trace.8.html"><b>trace</b>(8)</a> daemon as appropriate.

<b>SINGLE-RECIPIENT DELIVERY</b>
       Some external commands cannot handle more than one recipi-
       ent per delivery request. Examples of such transports  are
       pagers or fax machines.

       To  prevent  Postfix  from sending multiple recipients per
       delivery request, specify

           <i>transport</i><b>_destination_recipient_limit = 1</b>

       in the Postfix <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a> file, where <i>transport</i> is  the  name
       in the first column of the Postfix <a href="master.5.html"><b>master.cf</b></a> entry for the
       pipe-based delivery transport.

<b>COMMAND ATTRIBUTE SYNTAX</b>
       The external command attributes are given in the <a href="master.5.html"><b>master.cf</b></a>
       file at the end of a service definition.  The syntax is as
       follows:

       <b>chroot=</b><i>pathname</i> (optional)
              Change  the  process  root  directory  and  working
              directory  to  the  named  directory.  This happens
              before switching to the privileges  specified  with
              the   <b>user</b>  attribute,  and  before  executing  the
              optional <b>directory=</b><i>pathname</i> directive. Delivery  is
              deferred in case of failure.

              This feature is available as of Postfix 2.3.

       <b>directory=</b><i>pathname</i> (optional)
              Change  to the named directory before executing the
              external command.  The directory must be accessible
              for the user specified with the <b>user</b> attribute (see
              below).    The   default   working   directory   is
              <b>$<a href="postconf.5.html#queue_directory">queue_directory</a></b>.   Delivery is deferred in case of
              failure.

              This feature is available as of Postfix 2.2.

       <b>eol=</b><i>string</i> (optional, default: <b>\n</b>)
              The output record delimiter.  Typically  one  would
              use  either <b>\r\n</b> or <b>\n</b>. The usual C-style backslash
              escape sequences are recognized: <b>\a \b \f \n \r  \t</b>
              <b>\v \</b><i>ddd</i> (up to three octal digits) and <b>\\</b>.

       <b>flags=BDFORhqu.</b>&gt; (optional)
              Optional  message  processing  flags. By default, a
              message is copied unchanged.

              <b>B</b>      Append a blank line at the end of each  mes-
                     sage.  This  is  required  by some mail user
                     agents that recognize  "<b>From</b>  "  lines  only
                     when preceded by a blank line.

              <b>D</b>      Prepend  a "<b>Delivered-To:</b> <i>recipient</i>" message
                     header with the envelope recipient  address.
                     Note: for this to work, the <i>transport</i><b>_desti-</b>
                     <b>nation_recipient_limit</b> must be 1.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.

              <b>F</b>      Prepend  a "<b>From</b> <i>sender time</i><b>_</b><i>stamp</i>" envelope
                     header to  the  message  content.   This  is
                     expected by, for example, <b>UUCP</b> software.

              <b>O</b>      Prepend  an  "<b>X-Original-To:</b> <i>recipient</i>" mes-
                     sage header with the  recipient  address  as
                     given  to  Postfix.  Note: for this to work,
                     the    <i>transport</i><b>_destination_recipient_limit</b>
                     must be 1.

                     This feature is available as of Postfix 2.0.

              <b>R</b>      Prepend a <b>Return-Path:</b> message  header  with
                     the envelope sender address.

              <b>h</b>      Fold the command-line <b>$recipient</b> domain name
                     and <b>$nexthop</b> host name to lower case.   This
                     is recommended for delivery via <b>UUCP</b>.

              <b>q</b>      Quote  white space and other special charac-
                     ters in the command-line <b>$sender</b> and <b>$recip-</b>
                     <b>ient</b> address localparts (text to the left of
                     the right-most <b>@</b> character), according to an
                     8-bit  transparent version of <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</a>.  This
                     is recommended  for  delivery  via  <b>UUCP</b>  or
                     <b>BSMTP</b>.

                     The  result  is  compatible with the address
                     parsing of command-line  recipients  by  the
                     Postfix <a href="sendmail.1.html"><b>sendmail</b>(1)</a> mail submission command.

                     The <b>q</b> flag affects  only  entire  addresses,
                     not the partial address information from the
                     <b>$user</b>, <b>$extension</b> or  <b>$mailbox</b>  command-line
                     macros.

              <b>u</b>      Fold  the  command-line  <b>$recipient</b>  address
                     localpart (text to the left  of  the  right-
                     most  <b>@</b>  character)  to lower case.  This is
                     recommended for delivery via <b>UUCP</b>.

              <b>.</b>      Prepend "<b>.</b>" to lines starting with "<b>.</b>". This
                     is needed by, for example, <b>BSMTP</b> software.

              &gt;      Prepend  "&gt;" to lines starting with "<b>From</b> ".
                     This is expected by, for example, <b>UUCP</b> soft-
                     ware.

       <b>null_sender</b>=<i>replacement</i> (default: MAILER-DAEMON)
              Replace the null sender address, which is typically
              used for delivery status  notifications,  with  the
              specified  text when expanding the <b>$sender</b> command-
              line macro, and when generating a From_ or  Return-
              Path: message header.

              If  the null sender replacement text is a non-empty
              string then it  is  affected  by  the  <b>q</b>  flag  for
              address quoting in command-line arguments.

              The null sender replacement text may be empty; this
              form is recommended for content filters  that  feed
              mail back into Postfix. The empty sender address is
              not affected by the <b>q</b> flag for address  quoting  in
              command-line arguments.

              Caution: a null sender address is easily mis-parsed
              by naive software. For example,  when  the  <a href="pipe.8.html"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a>
              daemon executes a command such as:

                  command -f$sender -- $recipient (<i>bad</i>)

              the command will mis-parse the -f option value when
              the sender address is a null string.   For  correct
              parsing, specify <b>$sender</b> as an argument by itself:

                  command -f $sender -- $recipient (<i>good</i>)

              This  feature  is  available  with  Postfix 2.3 and
              later.

       <b>size</b>=<i>size</i><b>_</b><i>limit</i> (optional)
              Messages greater in size than this limit (in bytes)
              will be returned to the sender as undeliverable.

       <b>user</b>=<i>username</i> (required)

       <b>user</b>=<i>username</i>:<i>groupname</i>
              Execute the external command with the rights of the
              specified <i>username</i>.  The software refuses  to  exe-
              cute  commands  with  root  privileges, or with the
              privileges of the mail system owner.  If  <i>groupname</i>
              is  specified,  the  corresponding group ID is used
              instead of the group ID of <i>username</i>.

       <b>argv</b>=<i>command</i>... (required)
              The command to be executed. This must be  specified
              as the last command attribute.  The command is exe-
              cuted  directly,  i.e.  without  interpretation  of
              shell  meta  characters  by  a shell command inter-
              preter.

              In  the  command  argument  vector,  the  following
              macros are recognized and replaced with correspond-
              ing information  from  the  Postfix  queue  manager
              delivery request.

              In  addition  to  the form ${<i>name</i>}, the forms $<i>name</i>
              and $(<i>name</i>) are also recognized.  Specify <b>$$</b>  where
              a single <b>$</b> is wanted.

              <b>${client_address</b>}
                     This macro expands to the remote client net-
                     work address.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and  later.

              <b>${client_helo</b>}
                     This macro expands to the remote client HELO
                     command parameter.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and  later.

              <b>${client_hostname</b>}
                     This  macro  expands  to  the  remote client
                     hostname.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and  later.

              <b>${client_protocol</b>}
                     This macro expands to the remote client pro-
                     tocol.

                     This is available in Postfix 2.2 and  later.

              <b>${extension</b>}
                     This  macro expands to the extension part of
                     a recipient address.  For example,  with  an
                     address  <i>user+foo@domain</i>  the  extension  is
                     <i>foo</i>.

                     A  command-line   argument   that   contains
                     <b>${extension</b>}  expands  into as many command-
                     line arguments as there are recipients.

                     This information is modified by the  <b>u</b>  flag
                     for case folding.

              <b>${mailbox</b>}
                     This  macro  expands  to  the complete local
                     part of a recipient address.   For  example,
                     with  an address <i>user+foo@domain</i> the mailbox
                     is <i>user+foo</i>.

                     A  command-line   argument   that   contains
                     <b>${mailbox</b>}  expands  to as many command-line
                     arguments as there are recipients.

                     This information is modified by the  <b>u</b>  flag
                     for case folding.

              <b>${nexthop</b>}
                     This macro expands to the next-hop hostname.

                     This information is modified by the  <b>h</b>  flag
                     for case folding.

              <b>${recipient</b>}
                     This macro expands to the complete recipient
                     address.

                     A  command-line   argument   that   contains
                     <b>${recipient</b>} expands to as many command-line
                     arguments as there are recipients.

                     This information  is  modified  by  the  <b>hqu</b>
                     flags for quoting and case folding.

              <b>${sasl_method</b>}
                     This  macro  expands to the SASL authentica-
                     tion mechanism used during the reception  of
                     the  message.  An  empty string is passed if
                     the message has been received  without  SASL
                     authentication.

                     This  is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              <b>${sasl_sender</b>}
                     This macro expands to the SASL  sender  name
                     (i.e.  the  original  submitter  as  per RFC
                     2554) used during the reception of the  mes-
                     sage.

                     This  is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              <b>${sasl_username</b>}
                     This macro expands to  the  SASL  user  name
                     used during the reception of the message. An
                     empty string is passed if  the  message  has
                     been received without SASL authentication.

                     This  is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

              <b>${sender</b>}
                     This macro expands to  the  envelope  sender
                     address. By default, the null sender address
                     expands  to  MAILER-DAEMON;  this   can   be
                     changed  with  the <b>null_sender</b> attribute, as
                     described above.

                     This information is modified by the  <b>q</b>  flag
                     for quoting.

              <b>${size</b>}
                     This  macro expands to Postfix's idea of the
                     message size, which is an  approximation  of
                     the size of the message as delivered.

              <b>${user</b>}
                     This macro expands to the username part of a
                     recipient address.   For  example,  with  an
                     address <i>user+foo@domain</i> the username part is
                     <i>user</i>.

                     A  command-line   argument   that   contains
                     <b>${user</b>}  expands  into  as many command-line
                     arguments as there are recipients.

                     This information is modified by the  <b>u</b>  flag
                     for case folding.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3463.html">RFC 3463</a> (Enhanced status codes)

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Command  exit status codes are expected to follow the con-
       ventions defined in &lt;<b>sysexits.h</b>&gt;.   Exit  status  0  means
       normal successful completion.

       Postfix  version  2.3  and  later  support  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3463.html">RFC 3463</a>-style
       enhanced status codes.  If a  command  terminates  with  a
       non-zero  exit  status, and the command output begins with
       an enhanced status code, this status code takes precedence
       over the non-zero exit status.

       Problems  and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).  Cor-
       rupted message files are marked so that the queue  manager
       can move them to the <b>corrupt</b> queue for further inspection.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       This program needs a dual personality  1)  to  access  the
       private  Postfix  queue and IPC mechanisms, and 2) to exe-
       cute external commands as the specified user. It is there-
       fore security sensitive.

<b>CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS</b>
       Changes  to <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>main.cf</b></a> are picked up automatically as <a href="pipe.8.html"><b>pipe</b>(8)</a>
       processes run for only a limited amount of time.  Use  the
       command "<b>postfix reload</b>" to speed up a change.

       The  text  below  provides  only  a parameter summary. See
       <a href="postconf.5.html"><b>postconf</b>(5)</a> for more details including examples.

<b>RESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS</b>
       In the text below, <i>transport</i> is the first field in a  <b>mas-</b>
       <b>ter.cf</b> entry.

       <i>transport</i><b>_destination_concurrency_limit ($<a href="postconf.5.html#default_destination_concurrency_limit">default_destina</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#default_destination_concurrency_limit">tion_concurrency_limit</a>)</b>
              Limit the number of parallel deliveries to the same
              destination, for delivery via the named  <i>transport</i>.
              The limit is enforced by the Postfix queue manager.

       <i>transport</i><b>_destination_recipient_limit   ($<a href="postconf.5.html#default_destination_recipient_limit">default_destina</a>-</b>
       <b><a href="postconf.5.html#default_destination_recipient_limit">tion_recipient_limit</a>)</b>
              Limit the number of recipients per  message  deliv-
