   LOCAL FUNCTION

   solib_map_sections -- open bfd and build sections for shared lib

   SYNOPSIS

   static int solib_map_sections (struct so_list *so)

   DESCRIPTION

   Given a pointer to one of the shared objects in our list
   of mapped objects, use the recorded name to open a bfd
   descriptor for the object, build a section table, and then
   relocate all the section addresses by the base address at
   which the shared object was mapped.

   FIXMES

   In most (all?) cases the shared object file name recorded in the
   dynamic linkage tables will be a fully qualified pathname.  For
   cases where it isn't, do we really mimic the systems search
   mechanism correctly in the below code (particularly the tilde
   expansion stuff?).

   LOCAL FUNCTION

   locate_base -- locate the base address of dynamic linker structs

   SYNOPSIS

   CORE_ADDR locate_base (void)

   DESCRIPTION

   For both the SunOS and SVR4 shared library implementations, if the
   inferior executable has been linked dynamically, there is a single
   address somewhere in the inferior's data space which is the key to
   locating all of the dynamic linker's runtime structures.  This
   address is the value of the debug base symbol.  The job of this
   function is to find and return that address, or to return 0 if there
   is no such address (the executable is statically linked for example).

   For SunOS, the job is almost trivial, since the dynamic linker and
   all of it's structures are statically linked to the executable at
   link time.  Thus the symbol for the address we are looking for has
   already been added to the minimal symbol table for the executable's
   objfile at the time the symbol file's symbols were read, and all we
   have to do is look it up there.  Note that we explicitly do NOT want
   to find the copies in the shared library.

   The SVR4 version is a bit more complicated because the address
   is contained somewhere in the dynamic info section.  We have to go
   to a lot more work to discover the address of the debug base symbol.
   Because of this complexity, we cache the value we find and return that
   value on subsequent invocations.  Note there is no copy in the
   executable symbol tables.

   DESCRIPTION

   Provides a hook for other gdb routines to discover whether or
   not a particular address is within the mapped address space of
   a shared library.  Any address between the base mapping address
   and the first address beyond the end of the last mapping, is
   considered to be within the shared library address space, for
   our purposes.

   For example, this routine is called at one point to disable
   breakpoints which are in shared libraries that are not currently
   mapped in.

     an a.out executable until the user chooses an executable file.

     ELF shared libraries don't get mapped into the address space
     until after the program starts, so we'd better not try to insert
     breakpoints in them immediately.  We have to wait until the
     dynamic linker has loaded them; we'll hit a bp_shlib_event
     breakpoint (look for calls to create_solib_event_breakpoint) when
     it's ready.

     SunOS shared libraries seem to be different --- they're present
     as soon as the process begins execution, so there's no need to
     put off inserting breakpoints.  There's also nowhere to put a
     bp_shlib_event breakpoint, so if we put it off, we'll never get

   LOCAL FUNCTION

   enable_break -- arrange for dynamic linker to hit breakpoint

   SYNOPSIS

   int enable_break (void)

   DESCRIPTION

   Both the SunOS and the SVR4 dynamic linkers have, as part of their
   debugger interface, support for arranging for the inferior to hit
   a breakpoint after mapping in the shared libraries.  This function
   enables that breakpoint.

   For SunOS, there is a special flag location (in_debugger) which we
   set to 1.  When the dynamic linker sees this flag set, it will set
   a breakpoint at a location known only to itself, after saving the
   original contents of that place and the breakpoint address itself,
   in it's own internal structures.  When we resume the inferior, it
   will eventually take a SIGTRAP when it runs into the breakpoint.
   We handle this (in a different place) by restoring the contents of
   the breakpointed location (which is only known after it stops),
   chasing around to locate the shared libraries that have been
   loaded, then resuming.

   For SVR4, the debugger interface structure contains a member (r_brk)
   which is statically initialized at the time the shared library is
   built, to the offset of a function (_r_debug_state) which is guaran-
   teed to be called once before mapping in a library, and again when
   the mapping is complete.  At the time we are examining this member,
   it contains only the unrelocated offset of the function, so we have
   to do our own relocation.  Later, when the dynamic linker actually
   runs, it relocates r_brk to be the actual address of _r_debug_state().

   The debugger interface structure also contains an enumeration which
   is set to either RT_ADD or RT_DELETE prior to changing the mapping,
   depending upon whether or not the library is being mapped or unmapped,
   and then set to RT_CONSISTENT after the library is mapped/unmapped.

   GLOBAL FUNCTION

   solib_create_inferior_hook -- shared library startup support

   SYNOPSIS

   void solib_create_inferior_hook()

   DESCRIPTION

   When gdb starts up the inferior, it nurses it along (through the
   shell) until it is ready to execute it's first instruction.  At this
   point, this function gets called via expansion of the macro
   SOLIB_CREATE_INFERIOR_HOOK.

   For SunOS executables, this first instruction is typically the
   one at "_start", or a similar text label, regardless of whether
   the executable is statically or dynamically linked.  The runtime
   startup code takes care of dynamically linking in any shared
   libraries, once gdb allows the inferior to continue.

   For SVR4 executables, this first instruction is either the first
   instruction in the dynamic linker (for dynamically linked
   executables) or the instruction at "start" for statically linked
   executables.  For dynamically linked executables, the system
   first exec's /lib/libc.so.N, which contains the dynamic linker,
   and starts it running.  The dynamic linker maps in any needed
   shared libraries, maps in the actual user executable, and then
   jumps to "start" in the user executable.

   For both SunOS shared libraries, and SVR4 shared libraries, we
   can arrange to cooperate with the dynamic linker to discover the
   names of shared libraries that are dynamically linked, and the
   base addresses to which they are linked.

   This function is responsible for discovering those names and
   addresses, and saving sufficient information about them to allow
   their symbols to be read at a later time.

   FIXME

   Between enable_break() and disable_break(), this code does not
   properly handle hitting breakpoints which the user might have
   set in the startup code or in the dynamic linker itself.  Proper
   handling will probably have to wait until the implementation is
   changed to use the "breakpoint handler function" method.

   Also, what if child has exit()ed?  Must exit loop somehow.
