/* This module provides three functions: os9k_symfile_init,
   which initializes to read a symbol file; os9k_new_init, which 
   discards existing cached information when all symbols are being
   discarded; and os9k_symfile_read, which reads a symbol table
   from a file.

   os9k_symfile_read only does the minimum work necessary for letting the
   user "name" things symbolically; it does not read the entire symtab.
   Instead, it reads the external and static symbols and puts them in partial
   symbol tables.  When more extensive information is requested of a
   file, the corresponding partial symbol table is mutated into a full
   fledged symbol table by going back and reading the symbols
   for real.  os9k_psymtab_to_symtab() is the function that does this */

     the textlow of the pst.

     bfd/elf.c and gdb/elfread.c to pass the ELF st_size field
     to here via the misc_info field.  Therefore, we can fill in
     a reliable texthigh by taking the address plus size of the
     last function in the file.

     Unfortunately, that does not cover the case where the last function
     in the file is static.  See the paragraph below for more comments
     on this situation.
