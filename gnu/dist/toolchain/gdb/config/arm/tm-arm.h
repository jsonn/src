/* The following define instruction sequences that will cause ARM
   cpu's to take an undefined instruction trap.  These are used to
   signal a breakpoint to GDB.
   
   The newer ARMv4T cpu's are capable of operating in ARM or Thumb
   modes.  A different instruction is required for each mode.  The ARM
   cpu's can also be big or little endian.  Thus four different
   instructions are needed to support all cases.
   
   Note: ARMv4 defines several new instructions that will take the
   undefined instruction trap.  ARM7TDMI is nominally ARMv4T, but does
   not in fact add the new instructions.  The new undefined
   instructions in ARMv4 are all instructions that had no defined
   behaviour in earlier chips.  There is no guarantee that they will
   raise an exception, but may be treated as NOP's.  In practice, it
   may only safe to rely on instructions matching:
   
   3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
   1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
   C C C C 0 1 1 x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x 1 x x x x
   
   Even this may only true if the condition predicate is true. The
   following use a condition predicate of ALWAYS so it is always TRUE.
   
   There are other ways of forcing a breakpoint.  ARM Linux and
   RISC iX will use a software interrupt rather than an undefined
   instruction to force a trap.  This can be handled by redefining
   some or all of the following in a target dependent fashion.  */
