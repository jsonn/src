# cvs2netbsd: removes Id tag and unnecessary files before import of cvs into
# NetBSD's tree. Works on current directory.

### Remove the $'s around the Id:
for f in contrib/rcs2log.sh mkinstalldirs; do
	sed -e 's/\$\(Id[^\$]*\) \$/\1/' < $f > /tmp/cvstmp$$ && \
		mv /tmp/cvstmp$$ $f && echo Removed Id tag from $f
done

### Remove unnecessary files
rm -rf emx os2 tools vms windows-NT zlib && \
rm -f build.com cvsnt.* */.cvsignore && \
cd doc && rm -f cvs-paper.ps cvs.aux cvs.info* cvs.ps \
		cvsclient.aux cvsclient.info* cvsclient.ps && \
echo Removed unnecessary files. You can import now.
