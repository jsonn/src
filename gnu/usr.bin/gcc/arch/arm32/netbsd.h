/* VERY BIG NOTE : Change of structure alignment for RiscBSD.
   There are consequences you should be aware of */

/* Normally GCC/arm uses a structure alignment of 32. This means that
   structures are padded to a word boundry. However this causes
   problems with bugged NetBSD kernel code (possible userland code
   as well - I have not checked every binary).
   The nature of this the bugged code is to rely on sizeof() returning
   the correct size of various structures rounded to the nearest byte
   (SCSI and ether code are two examples, the vm system is another)
   This code starts to break when the structure alignment is 32 as sizeof()
   will report a word rounded size.
   By changing the structure alignment to 8. GCC will conform to what
   is expected by NetBSD.

   This has several side effects that should be considered.
   1. Structures will only be aligned to the size of the largest member.
      i.e. structures containing only bytes will be byte aligned.
           structures containing shorts will be half word alinged.
           structures containing ints will be word aligned.

      This means structures should be padded to a word boundry if
      alignment of 32 is require for byte structures etc.
      
   2. A potential performance penalty may exist if strings are no longer
      word aligned. GCC will not be able to use word load/stores for copy
      short strings.
      
   This modification is not encouraged but with the present state of the
   NetBSD source tree it is currently the only solution to meet the
   requirements.
