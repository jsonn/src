   stock m88k/svr4 assembler, both of which need to see .L at the start of
   a label in order to prevent that label from going into the linker symbol

     structure type) of the hypothetical "containing object" for a bit-
     field.  Thus, when computing the byte offset value for the start of
     the "containing object" of a bit-field, we must deduce this infor-
     mation on our own.

     This can be rather tricky to do in some cases.  For example, handling
     the following structure type definition when compiling for an i386/i486
     target (which only aligns long long's to 32-bit boundaries) can be very
     tricky:

		struct S {
			int		field1;
			long long	field2:31;
		};

     Fortunately, there is a simple rule-of-thumb which can be used in such
     cases.  When compiling for an i386/i486, GCC will allocate 8 bytes for
     the structure shown above.  It decides to do this based upon one simple
     rule for bit-field allocation.  Quite simply, GCC allocates each "con-
     taining object" for each bit-field at the first (i.e. lowest addressed)
     legitimate alignment boundary (based upon the required minimum alignment
     for the declared type of the field) which it can possibly use, subject
     to the condition that there is still enough available space remaining
     in the containing object (when allocated at the selected point) to
     fully accommodate all of the bits of the bit-field itself.

     This simple rule makes it obvious why GCC allocates 8 bytes for each
     object of the structure type shown above.  When looking for a place to
     allocate the "containing object" for `field2', the compiler simply tries
     to allocate a 64-bit "containing object" at each successive 32-bit
     boundary (starting at zero) until it finds a place to allocate that 64-
     bit field such that at least 31 contiguous (and previously unallocated)
     bits remain within that selected 64 bit field.  (As it turns out, for
     the example above, the compiler finds that it is OK to allocate the
     "containing object" 64-bit field at bit-offset zero within the
     structure type.)

     Here we attempt to work backwards from the limited set of facts we're
     given, and we try to deduce from those facts, where GCC must have
     believed that the containing object started (within the structure type).

     The value we deduce is then used (by the callers of this routine) to
     generate AT_location and AT_bit_offset attributes for fields (both
     bit-fields and, in the case of AT_location, regular fields as well).

  /* Here we have to decide where we are going to say the parameter "lives"
     (as far as the debugger is concerned).  We only have a couple of choices.
     GCC provides us with DECL_RTL and with DECL_INCOMING_RTL.  DECL_RTL
     normally indicates where the parameter lives during most of the activa-
     tion of the function.  If optimization is enabled however, this could
     be either NULL or else a pseudo-reg.  Both of those cases indicate that
     the parameter doesn't really live anywhere (as far as the code generation
     parts of GCC are concerned) during most of the function's activation.
     That will happen (for example) if the parameter is never referenced
     within the function.

     We could just generate a location descriptor here for all non-NULL
     non-pseudo values of DECL_RTL and ignore all of the rest, but we can
     be a little nicer than that if we also consider DECL_INCOMING_RTL in
     cases where DECL_RTL is NULL or is a pseudo-reg.

     Note however that we can only get away with using DECL_INCOMING_RTL as
     a backup substitute for DECL_RTL in certain limited cases.  In cases
     where DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) indicates the same type as TREE_TYPE(decl)
     we can be sure that the parameter was passed using the same type as it
     is declared to have within the function, and that its DECL_INCOMING_RTL
     points us to a place where a value of that type is passed.  In cases
     where DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) and TREE_TYPE(decl) are different types
     however, we cannot (in general) use DECL_INCOMING_RTL as a backup
     substitute for DECL_RTL because in these cases, DECL_INCOMING_RTL
     points us to a value of some type which is *different* from the type
     of the parameter itself.  Thus, if we tried to use DECL_INCOMING_RTL
     to generate a location attribute in such cases, the debugger would
     end up (for example) trying to fetch a `float' from a place which
     actually contains the first part of a `double'.  That would lead to
     really incorrect and confusing output at debug-time, and we don't
     want that now do we?

     So in general, we DO NOT use DECL_INCOMING_RTL as a backup for DECL_RTL
     in cases where DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) != TREE_TYPE(decl).  There are a
     couple of cute exceptions however.  On little-endian machines we can
     get away with using DECL_INCOMING_RTL even when DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) is
     not the same as TREE_TYPE(decl) but only when DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) is
     an integral type which is smaller than TREE_TYPE(decl).  These cases
     arise when (on a little-endian machine) a non-prototyped function has
     a parameter declared to be of type `short' or `char'.  In such cases,
     TREE_TYPE(decl) will be `short' or `char', DECL_ARG_TYPE(decl) will be
     `int', and DECL_INCOMING_RTL will point to the lowest-order byte of the
     passed `int' value.  If the debugger then uses that address to fetch a
     `short' or a `char' (on a little-endian machine) the result will be the
     correct data, so we allow for such exceptional cases below.

     Note that our goal here is to describe the place where the given formal
     parameter lives during most of the function's activation (i.e. between
     the end of the prologue and the start of the epilogue).  We'll do that
     as best as we can.  Note however that if the given formal parameter is
     modified sometime during the execution of the function, then a stack
     backtrace (at debug-time) will show the function as having been called
     with the *new* value rather than the value which was originally passed
     in.  This happens rarely enough that it is not a major problem, but it
     *is* a problem, and I'd like to fix it.  A future version of dwarfout.c
     may generate two additional attributes for any given TAG_formal_parameter
     DIE which will describe the "passed type" and the "passed location" for
     the given formal parameter in addition to the attributes we now generate
     to indicate the "declared type" and the "active location" for each
     parameter.  This additional set of attributes could be used by debuggers
     for stack backtraces.

     Separately, note that sometimes DECL_RTL can be NULL and DECL_INCOMING_RTL
     can be NULL also.  This happens (for example) for inlined-instances of
     inline function formal parameters which are never referenced.  This really
     shouldn't be happening.  All PARM_DECL nodes should get valid non-NULL
     DECL_INCOMING_RTL values, but integrate.c doesn't currently generate
     these values for inlined instances of inline function parameters, so
     when we see such cases, we are just SOL (shit-out-of-luck) for the time
     being (until integrate.c gets fixed).

   It order to delay the production of DIEs representing types of formal

   the `scope' parameter to this function.  Given that fake_containing_scope
   is a tagged type which is *not* the containing scope for *any* other type,
   the desired effect is achieved, i.e. output of DIEs representing types
   is temporarily suspended, and any type DIEs which would have otherwise
   been output are instead placed onto the pending_types_list.  Later on,
   we force these (temporarily pended) types to be output simply by calling
   `output_pending_types_for_scope' with an actual argument equal to the

   We need such numbers for the sake of generating labels (in the
   .debug_sfnames section) and references to those unique labels (in the
   .debug_srcinfo and .debug_macinfo sections).

   If the filename given as an argument is not found in our current list,
   add it to the list and assign it the next available unique index number.

   Whatever we do (i.e. whether we find a pre-existing filename or add a new
   one), we shuffle the filename found (or added) up to the zeroth entry of
   our list of filenames (which is always searched linearly).  We do this so
   as to optimize the most common case for these filename lookups within
   dwarfout.c.  The most common case by far is the case where we call
   lookup_filename to lookup the very same filename that we did a lookup
   on the last time we called lookup_filename.  We make sure that this
   common case is fast because such cases will constitute 99.9% of the
   lookups we ever do (in practice).

   If we add a new filename entry to our table, we go ahead and generate
   the corresponding entry in the .debug_sfnames section right away.
   Doing so allows us to avoid tickling an assembler bug (present in some
   m68k assemblers) which yields assembly-time errors in cases where the
   difference of two label addresses is taken and where the two labels
   are in a section *other* than the one where the difference is being
   calculated, and where at least one of the two symbol references is a
   forward reference.  (This bug could be tickled by our .debug_srcinfo
   entries if we don't output their corresponding .debug_sfnames entries
   before them.)

  /* The (null) DIE which represents the terminator for the (sibling linked)
     list of file-scope items is *special*.  Normally, we would just call
     end_sibling_chain at this point in order to output a word with the
     value `4' and that word would act as the terminator for the list of
     DIEs describing file-scope items.  Unfortunately, if we were to simply
     do that, the label that would follow this DIE in the .debug section
     (i.e. `..D2') would *not* be properly aligned (as it must be on some
     machines) to a 4 byte boundary.

     In order to force the label `..D2' to get aligned to a 4 byte boundary,
     the trick used is to insert extra (otherwise useless) padding bytes
     into the (null) DIE that we know must precede the ..D2 label in the
     .debug section.  The amount of padding required can be anywhere between
     0 and 3 bytes.  The length word at the start of this DIE (i.e. the one
     with the padding) would normally contain the value 4, but now it will
     also have to include the padding bytes, so it will instead have some
     value in the range 4..7.

     Fortunately, the rules of Dwarf say that any DIE whose length word
     contains *any* value less than 8 should be treated as a null DIE, so
     this trick works out nicely.  Clever, eh?  Don't give me any credit
     (or blame).  I didn't think of this scheme.  I just conformed to it.
