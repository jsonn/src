.TH nss-ldapd.conf 5 "May 2008" "Version 0.6.2" "System Manager's Manual"
.SH NAME
nss-ldapd.conf \- configuration file for LDAP nameservice provider
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fInss-ldapd\fR module allows LDAP
directory servers to be used as a primary source of name service
information. (Name service information typically includes users, hosts,
groups, and other such data historically stored in flat files or
NIS.)
.PP
The file \*(T<\fInss\-ldapd.conf\fR\*(T> contains the
configuration information for running \fBnslcd\fR (see
\fBnslcd\fR(8)).
The file contains options, one on each line, defining the way
NSS lookups are mapped onto
LDAP lookups.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "RUNTIME OPTIONS"
.TP 
\*(T<\fBthreads\fR\*(T> \fINUM\fR
Specifies the number of threads to start that can handle requests
and perform LDAP queries.
The default is to start 5 threads.
.SS "GENERAL CONNECTION OPTIONS"
.TP 
\*(T<\fBuri\fR\*(T> \fIURI\fR
Specifies the LDAP URI of the
server to connect to.
The URI scheme may be \fIldap\fR,
\fIldapi\fR or \fIldaps\fR, specifying
LDAP over TCP,
ICP or SSL respectively (if
supported by the LDAP library).
Alternatively, the value \fIDNS\fR may be
used to try to lookup the server using DNS
SRV records.

When using the ldapi scheme, %2f should be used to escape slashes
(e.g. ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fslapd%2fldapi/), although most of the
time this should not be needed.

This option may be specified multiple times. Normally, only the first
server will be used with the following servers as fall-back (see
\*(T<\fBbind_timelimit\fR\*(T> below).

If LDAP lookups are used for host name resolution,
any host names should be specified as an IP address or name that can be
resolved without using LDAP.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBldap_version\fR\*(T> \fIVERSION\fR
Specifies the version of the LDAP protocol to use.
The default is to use the maximum version supported by the
LDAP library.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBbinddn\fR\*(T> \fIDN\fR
Specifies the distinguished name with which to bind to the directory
server for lookups.
The default is to bind anonymously.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBbindpw\fR\*(T> \fIPASSWORD\fR
Specifies the clear text credentials with which to bind.
This option is only applicable when used with \*(T<\fBbinddn\fR\*(T> above.

When binding to the directory using SASL or other
authentication mechanisms apart from simple binds, this option is not
used.
.SS "KERBEROS AUTHENTICATION OPTIONS"
.TP 
\*(T<\fBkrb5_ccname\fR\*(T> \fINAME\fR
Set the name for the GSS-API Kerberos credentials cache.
.SS "SEARCH/MAPPING OPTIONS"
.TP 
\*(T<\fBbase\fR\*(T> [\fIMAP\fR] \fIDN\fR
Specifies the base distinguished name (DN)
to use as search base.
A global search base may be specified or a MAP-specific one.
If no MAP-specific search base is defined the global one is used.

If, instead of a DN, the value
\fIDOMAIN\fR is specified, the hosts
DNS domain is used to construct a basedn.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBscope\fR\*(T> [\fIMAP\fR] sub[tree]|one[level]|base
Specifies the search scope (subtree, one level or base object).
The default scope is subtree; base scope is almost never useful for
name service lookups.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBderef\fR\*(T> never|searching|finding|always
Specifies the policy for dereferencing aliases.
The default policy is to never dereference aliases.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBreferrals\fR\*(T> yes|no
Specifies whether automatic referral chasing should be enabled.
The default behaviour is to chase referrals.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBfilter\fR\*(T> \fIMAP\fR \fIFILTER\fR
The \fIFILTER\fR
is an LDAP search filter to use for a
specific map.
The default filter is a basic search on the
objectClass for the map (e.g. \*(T<(objectClass=posixAccount)\*(T>).
.TP 
\*(T<\fBmap\fR\*(T> \fIMAP\fR \fIATTRIBUTE\fR \fINEWATTRIBUTE\fR
This option allows for custom attributes to be looked up instead of
the default RFC 2307 attributes.
The \fIMAP\fR may be one of
the supported maps below.
The \fIATTRIBUTE\fR is the one as
used in RFC 2307 (e.g. \*(T<userPassword\*(T>,
\*(T<ipProtocolNumber\*(T> or \*(T<macAddress\*(T>).
The \fINEWATTRIBUTE\fR may be any attribute
as it is available in the directory.
.SS "TIMING/RECONNECT OPTIONS"
.TP 
\*(T<\fBbind_timelimit\fR\*(T> \fISECONDS\fR
Specifies the time limit (in seconds) to use when connecting to the
directory server.
This is distinct from the time limit specified in
\*(T<\fBtimelimit\fR\*(T> and affects the setup of the connection only.
Note that not all LDAP client libraries have support
for setting the connection time out.
The default \*(T<\fBbind_timelimit\fR\*(T> is 30 seconds.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBtimelimit\fR\*(T> \fISECONDS\fR
Specifies the time limit (in seconds) to wait for a response from the
LDAP server.
A value of zero (0), which is the default, is to wait indefinitely for
searches to be completed.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBidle_timelimit\fR\*(T> \fISECONDS\fR
Specifies the period if inactivity (in seconds) after which the
connection to the LDAP server will be closed.
The default is not to time out connections.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBreconnect_sleeptime\fR\*(T> \fISECONDS\fR
Specifies the number of seconds to sleep when connecting to all
LDAP servers fails.
By default 1 second is waited between the first failure and the first
retry.
.TP 
\*(T<\fBreconnect_maxsleeptime\fR\*(T> \fISECONDS\fR
Specified the time after the last successful operation from which the
LDAP server is considered permanently unavailable.
Retries will be done only once in this time period.
The default value is 30 seconds.
.PP
Note that the reconnect logic as described above is the mechanism that
is used between \fBnslcd\fR and the LDAP
server. The mechanism between the NSS client library
and \fBnslcd\fR is simpler with a fixed compiled-in
time out of a 10 seconds for writing to \fBnslcd\fR and
a time out of 20 seconds for reading answers.
\fBnslcd\fR itself has a read time out of 0.5 seconds
and a write time out of 5 seconds.
.SS "SSL/TLS OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fIssl <on|off|start_tls>\fR
Specifies whether to use SSL/TLS or not (the default is not to). If
\fIstart_tls\fR
is specified then StartTLS is used rather than raw LDAP over SSL.
Not all LDAP client libraries support both SSL
and StartTLS, and all related configuration options.
.TP 
\fIsslpath <cert7_path>\fR
For the Netscape and Mozilla
LDAP
client libraries only, this specifies the path to the X.509
certificate database.
.TP 
\fItls_checkpeer <yes|no>\fR
Specifies whether to require and verify the server certificate
or not, when using SSL/TLS
with the OpenLDAP client library.
The default is to use the default behaviour of the client
library; for OpenLDAP 2.0 and earlier it is "no", for OpenLDAP
2.1 and later it is "yes". At least one of
\fItls_cacertdir\fR
and
\fItls_cacertfile\fR
is required if peer verification is enabled.
.TP 
\fItls_cacertdir <certificate_dir>\fR
Specifies the directory containing X.509 certificates for peer
authentication.
.TP 
\fItls_cacertfile <certificate_file>\fR
Specifies the path to the X.509 certificate for peer authentication.
.TP 
\fItls_randfile <entropy_file>\fR
Specifies the path to an entropy source.
.TP 
\fItls_ciphers <ciphers>\fR
Specifies the ciphers to use for TLS.
See your TLS implementation's
documentation for further information.
.TP 
\fItls_cert <certificate_file>\fR
Specifies the path to the file containing the local certificate for
client TLS authentication.
.TP 
\fItls_key <key_file>\fR
Specifies the path to the file containing the private key for client
TLS authentication.
.SS "OTHER OPTIONS"
.TP 
\*(T<\fBpagesize\fR\*(T> \fINUMBER\fR
Set this to a number greater than 0 to request paged results from
the LDAP server in accordance with RFC2696.
The default (0) is to not request paged results.

This is useful for LDAP servers that contain a
lot of entries (e.g. more than 500) and limit the number of entries
that are returned with one request.
For OpenLDAP servers you may need to set
\*(T<\fBsizelimit size.prtotal=unlimited\fR\*(T>
for allowing more entries to be returned over multiple pages.
.SH "SUPPORTED MAPS"
The following maps are supported. They are referenced as
\fIMAP\fR in the options above.
.TP

Mail aliases.
Note that most mail servers do not use the NSS
interface for requesting mail aliases and parse
\*(T<\fI/etc/aliases\fR\*(T> on their own.
.TP 
ether[s]
Ethernet numbers (mac addresses).
.TP 
group
Posix groups.
.TP 
host[s]
