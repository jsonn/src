This directory contains native slapd plugins for password mechanisms that
are not actively supported by the project. Currently this includes the
Kerberos, Netscape MTA-MD5 and RADIUS password mechanisms.

To use the Kerberos plugin, add:

moduleload pw-kerberos.so

to your slapd configuration file.

To use the Netscape plugin, add:

moduleload pw-netscape.so

to your slapd configuration file.

To use the RADIUS plugin, add:

moduleload pw-radius.so

to your slapd configuration file; optionally, the path to a configuration
file can be appended in the form

moduleload pw-radius.so config="/etc/radius.conf"

No Makefile is provided. Use a command line similar to:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -DHAVE_KRB5 -o pw-kerberos.so kerberos.c

to compile the Kerberos plugin. Replace HAVE_KRB5 with HAVE_KRB4 if you want
to use Kerberos IV. If your Kerberos header files are not in the C compiler's
default path, you will need to add a "-I" directive for that as well.

The corresponding command for the Netscape plugin would be:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -o pw-netscape.so netscape.c

The corresponding command for the RADIUS plugin would be:

gcc -shared -I../../../include -Wall -g -o pw-radius.so radius.c -lradius

(Actually, you might want to statically link the RADIUS client library 
libradius.a into the module).
