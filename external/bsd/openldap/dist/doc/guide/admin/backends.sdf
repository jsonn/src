H1: Backends


H2: Berkeley DB Backends


H3: Overview

The {{bdb}} backend to {{slapd}}(8) is the recommended primary backend for a 
normal {{slapd}} database.  It uses the Oracle Berkeley DB ({{TERM:BDB}}) 
package to store data. It makes extensive use of indexing and caching 
(see the {{SECT:Tuning}} section) to speed data access.

{{hdb}} is a variant of the {{bdb}} backend that uses a hierarchical database 
layout which supports subtree renames. It is otherwise identical to the {{bdb}}
 behavior, and all the same configuration options apply.

Note: An {{hdb}} database needs a large {{idlcachesize}} for good search performance, 
typically three times the {{cachesize}} (entry cache size) or larger.

H2: LDAP


H3: Overview

The LDAP backend to {{slapd}}(8) is not an actual database; instead it acts 
as a proxy to forward incoming requests to another LDAP server. While 
processing requests it will also chase referrals, so that referrals are fully
processed instead of being returned to the {{slapd}} client.

Sessions that explicitly {{Bind}} to the {{back-ldap}} database always create 
their own private connection to the remote LDAP server. Anonymous sessions 
will share a single anonymous connection to the remote server. For sessions 
bound through other mechanisms, all sessions with the same DN will share the 
same connection. This connection pooling strategy can enhance the proxy's 
efficiency by reducing the overhead of repeatedly making/breaking multiple 
connections.

The ldap database can also act as an information service, i.e. the identity 
of locally authenticated clients is asserted to the remote server, possibly 
in some modified form. For this purpose, the proxy binds to the remote server 
with some administrative identity, and, if required, authorizes the asserted 
identity.

H2: LDIF


H3: Overview

The LDIF backend to {{slapd}}(8) is a basic storage backend that stores 
entries in text files in LDIF format, and exploits the filesystem to create 
the tree structure of the database. It is intended as a cheap, low performance 
easy to use backend.

When using the {{cn=config}} dynamic configuration database with persistent
storage, the configuration data is stored using this backend. See {{slapd-config}}(5)
for more information

H2: Metadirectory


H3: Overview

The meta backend to {{slapd}}(8) performs basic LDAP proxying with respect 
to a set of remote LDAP servers, called "targets". The information contained 
in these servers can be presented as belonging to a single Directory Information 
Tree ({{TERM:DIT}}).

A basic knowledge of the functionality of the {{slapd-ldap}}(5) backend is 
recommended. This backend has been designed as an enhancement of the ldap 
backend. The two backends share many features (actually they also share portions
 of code). While the ldap backend is intended to proxy operations directed 
 to a single server, the meta backend is mainly intended for proxying of 
 multiple servers and possibly naming context  masquerading.

These features, although useful in many scenarios, may result in excessive 
overhead for some applications, so its use should be carefully considered.

H2: Monitor


H3: Overview

The monitor backend to {{slapd}}(8) is not an actual database; if enabled, 
it is automatically generated and dynamically maintained by slapd with 
information about the running status of the daemon.

To inspect all monitor information, issue a subtree search with base {{cn=Monitor}}, 
requesting that attributes "+" and "*" are returned. The monitor backend produces 
mostly operational attributes, and LDAP only returns operational attributes 
that are explicitly requested.  Requesting attribute "+" is an extension which 
requests all operational attributes.

See the {{SECT:Monitoring}} section.

H2: Null


H3: Overview

The Null backend to {{slapd}}(8) is surely the most useful part of slapd:

* Searches return success but no entries.
* Compares return compareFalse.
* Updates return success (unless readonly is on) but do nothing.
* Binds other than as the rootdn fail unless the database option "bind on" is given.
* The slapadd(8) and slapcat(8) tools are equally exciting.

Inspired by the {{F:/dev/null}} device.

H2: Passwd


H3: Overview

The PASSWD backend to {{slapd}}(8) serves up the user account information 
listed in the system {{passwd}}(5) file.

This backend is provided for demonstration purposes only. The DN of each entry 
is "uid=<username>,<suffix>".

H2: Perl/Shell

H3: Overview

The Perl backend to {{slapd}}(8) works by embedding a {{perl}}(1) interpreter 
into {{slapd}}(8). Any perl database section of the configuration file 
{{slapd.conf}}(5) must then specify what Perl module to use. Slapd then creates 
a new Perl object that handles all the requests for that particular instance of the backend.

The Shell backend to {{slapd}}(8) executes external programs to implement 
operations, and is designed to make it easy to tie an existing database to the 
slapd front-end. This backend is is primarily intended to be used in prototypes.

H2: Relay


H3: Overview

The primary purpose of this {{slapd}}(8) backend is to map a naming context 
defined in a database running in the same {{slapd}}(8) instance into a 
virtual naming context, with attributeType and objectClass manipulation, if
required. It requires the rwm overlay.

This backend and the above mentioned overlay are experimental.

H2: SQL


H3: Overview

The primary purpose of this {{slapd}}(8) backend is to PRESENT information 
stored in some RDBMS as an LDAP subtree without any programming (some SQL and 
maybe stored procedures canâ€™t be considered programming, anyway ;).

That is, for example, when you (some ISP) have account information you use in 
an RDBMS, and want to use modern solutions that expect such information in LDAP 
(to authenticate users, make email lookups etc.). Or you want to synchronize or 
distribute information between different sites/applications that use RDBMSes 
and/or LDAP. Or whatever else...

It is {{B:NOT}} designed as a general-purpose backend that uses RDBMS instead of 
BerkeleyDB (as the standard BDB backend does), though it can be used as such with 
several limitations. Please see {{SECT: LDAP vs RDBMS}} for discussion.

The idea is to use some meta-information to translate LDAP queries to SQL queries, 
leaving relational schema untouched, so that old applications can continue using 
it without any modifications. This allows SQL and LDAP applications to interoperate 
without replication, and exchange data as needed.

The SQL backend is designed to be tunable to virtually any relational schema without 
having to change source (through that meta-information mentioned). Also, it uses 
ODBC to connect to RDBMSes, and is highly configurable for SQL dialects RDBMSes 
may use, so it may be used for integration and distribution of data on different 
RDBMSes, OSes, hosts etc., in other words, in highly heterogeneous environment.

This backend is experimental.
