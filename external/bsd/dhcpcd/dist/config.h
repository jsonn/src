/*
 * By default we don't add a local link route if we got a routeable address.
 * This is because dhcpcd can't really decide which interface should allow
 * link local routing when we have more than one interface.
 * Ideally the host network scripts should add the link local route for us.
 * If not, you can define this to get dhcpcd to always add the link local route.
