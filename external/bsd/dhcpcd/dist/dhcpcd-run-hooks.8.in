.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpcd-run-hooks
.Nd DHCP client configuration script 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used by
.Xr dhcpcd 8
to run any system and user defined hook scripts.
System hook scripts are found in
.Pa @HOOKDIR@
and the user defined hooks are 
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.enter-hook .
and
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.exit-hook .
The default install supplies hook scripts for configuring
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
and the hostname.
Your distribution may have included other hook scripts to say configure
ntp or ypbind.
A test hook is also supplied that simply echos the dhcp variables to the
console from DISCOVER message.
.Pp
Each time
.Nm
is invoked,
.Ev $interface
is set to the interface that
.Nm dhcpcd
is run on and
.Ev $reason
is to the reason why
.Nm
was invoked.
DHCP information to be configured is held in variables starting with the word
new_ and old DHCP information to be removed is held in variables starting with
the word old_.
.Nm dhcpcd
can display the full list of variables it knows how about by using the
.Fl V , -variables
argument.
.Pp
Here's a list of reasons why
.Nm
could be invoked:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv PREINIT
dhcpcd is starting up and any pre-initialisation should be done.
.It Dv INFORM
dhcpcd informed a DHCP server about it's address and obtained other
configuration details.
.It Dv BOUND
dhcpcd obtained a new lease from a DHCP server.
.It Dv RENEW
dhcpcd renewed it's lease.
.It Dv REBIND
dhcpcd has rebound to a new DHCP server.
.It Dv REBOOT
dhcpcd successfully requested a lease from a DHCP server.
.It Dv EXPIRE
dhcpcd's lease expired and it failed to obtain a new one.
.It Dv IPV4LL
dhcpcd failed to contact any DHCP servers but did obtain an IPV4LL address.
.It Dv FAIL
dhcpcd failed to contact any DHCP servers or use an old lease.
.It Dv TIMEOUT
dhcpcd failed to contact any DHCP servers but was able to use an old lease.
.It Dv TEST
dhcpcd received an OFFER from a DHCP server but will not configure the
interface.
This is primarily used to test the variables are filled correctly for the
script to process them.
.El
.Sh FILES 
When
.Nm
runs, it loads
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.enter-hook
and any scripts found in
.Pa @HOOKDIR@
in a lexical order and then finally
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.exit-hook
