dhcpcd - DHCP client daemon
Copyright (c) 2006-2009 Roy Marples <roy@marples.name>


Installation
------------
Then just make; make install
man dhcpcd for command line options
man dhcpcd.conf for configuration options
man dhcpcd-run-hooks to learn how to hook scripts into dhcpcd events


Notes
-----
If you're cross compiling you may need to set the below knobs to avoid
automatic tests.
OS=BSD | Linux

If you're building for an MMU-less system where fork() does not work, you
should add -DTHERE_IS_NO_FORK to your CPPFLAGS.
This also puts the --no-background flag on and stops the --background flag
from working.

You can change the default dir with these knobs.
For example, to satisfy FHS compliance you would do this:-
LIBEXECDIR=/lib/dhcpcd
DBDIR=/var/lib/dhcpcd

We now default to using -std=c99. For 64-bit linux, this always works, but
for 32-bit linux it requires either gnu99 or a patch to asm/types.h.
Most distros patch linux headers so this should work fine.
linux-2.6.24 finally ships with a working 32-bit header.
If your linux headers are older, or your distro hasn't patched them you can
set CSTD=gnu99 to work around this.

Some BSD systems do not allow the manipulation of automatically added subnet
routes. You can find discussion here:
    http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-net/2008/12/03/msg000896.html
BSD systems where this has been fixed are:
    NetBSD-5.99.6


Hooks
-----
Not all the hooks in dhcpcd-hooks are installed by default.
By default we install 01-test, 10-mtu, 20-resolv.conf and 30-hostname.
To add more simply add them in the HOOKSCRIPTS variable.
make HOOKSCRIPTS=50-ntp install


Compatibility
-------------
dhcpcd-5.0 is only fully command line compatible with dhcpcd-4.0
For compatibility with older versions, use dhcpcd-4.0

dhcpcd no longer sends a default ClientID for ethernet interfaces.
This is so we can re-use the address the kernel DHCP client found.
To retain the old behaviour of sending a default ClientID based on the
hardware address for interface, simply add the keyword clientid to dhcpcd.conf.


ChangeLog
---------
We no longer supply a ChangeLog.
