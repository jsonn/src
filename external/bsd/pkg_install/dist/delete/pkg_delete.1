.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_delete
.Nd a utility for deleting previously installed software package distributions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl ADFfkNnORrVv
.Bk -words
.Op Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
.Ek
.Bk -words
.Op Fl P Ar destdir
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Ek
.Ar pkg-name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to delete packages that have been previously installed
with the
.Xr pkg_add 1
command.
The given packages are sorted, so that the dependencies of a package
are deleted after the package.
Before any action is executed,
.Nm
checks for packages that are marked as
.Cm preserved
or have depending packages left.
If the
.Fl k
flag is given, preserved packages are removed from the list of packages
to remove.
Unless the
.Fl f
flag is given,
.Nm
stops on the first error.
.Sh WARNING
.Bf -emphasis
Since the
.Nm
command may execute scripts or programs provided by a package file,
your system may be susceptible to
.Dq Trojan horses
or other subtle
attacks from miscreants who create dangerous package files.
.Pp
You are advised to verify the competence and identity of those who
provide installable package files.
For extra protection, examine all the package control files in the
package record directory
.Pa ( /var/db/pkg/\*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt]/ ) .
Pay particular
attention to any
.Pa +INSTALL
or
.Pa +DEINSTALL
files, and inspect the
.Pa +CONTENTS
file for
.Cm @cwd ,
.Cm @mode
(check for setuid),
.Cm @dirrm ,
.Cm @exec ,
and
.Cm @unexec
directives, and/or use the
.Xr pkg_info 1
command to examine the installed package control files.
.Ef
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar pkg-name ...
The named packages are deinstalled, wildcards can be used, see
.Xr pkg_info 1 .
If no version is given, the one currently installed
will be removed.
If the
.Fl F
flag is given, one or more (absolute) filenames may be specified and
the Package Database will be consulted for the package to which the
given file belongs.
These packages are then deinstalled.
.It Fl A
Recursively remove all automatically installed packages that were needed
by the given packages and are no longer required.
See also the
.Fl R
flag.
.It Fl D
If a deinstallation script exists for a given package, do not execute it.
.It Fl F
Any pkg-name given will be interpreted as pathname which is
subsequently transformed in a (real) package name via the Package
Database.
That way, packages can be deleted by giving a filename
instead of the package-name.
.It Fl f
Force removal of the package, even if a dependency is recorded or the
deinstall script fails.
.It Fl ff
Force removal of the package, even if the package is marked as a
.Cm preserved
package.
Note that this is a dangerous operation.
See also the
.Fl k
option.
.It Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
Set
.Ar pkg_dbdir
as the package database directory.
If this option isn't specified, then the package database directory is
taken from the value of the environment variable
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
if it's set, otherwise it defaults to
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Fl k
Silently skip all packages that are marked as
.Cm preserved .
.It Fl N
Remove the package's registration and its entries from the package database,
but leave the files installed.
Don't run any deinstall scripts or @unexec lines either.
.It Fl n
Don't actually deinstall a package, just report the steps that
would be taken if it were.
.It Fl O
Only delete the package's entries from the package database, do not
touch the package or its files itself.
.It Fl p Ar destdir
Prefix all file and directory names with
.Ar destdir .
For packages without install scripts this has the same behavior as
using chroot.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the directory in which to delete files from any installed packages
which do not explicitly set theirs.
For most packages, the prefix will
be set automatically to the installed location by
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.It Fl R
Recursively remove all packages that were needed by the given packages
and that have no other dependencies left.
This option overrides the
.Fl A
flag.
.It Fl r
Recursively remove all packages that require one of the packages given.
.It Fl V
Print version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.

.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
.Nm
does pretty much what it says.
It examines installed package records in
.Pa /var/db/pkg/\*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt] ,
deletes the package contents, and finally removes the package records
(if an alternate package database directory is specified, then it
overrides the
.Pa /var/db/pkg
path shown above).
.Pp
If a package is required by other installed packages,
.Nm
will list those dependent packages and refuse to delete the package
(unless the
.Fl f
option is given).
.Pp
If a package has been marked as a
.Cm preserved
package, it will not be able to be deleted
(unless more than one occurrence of the
.Fl f
option is given).
.Pp
If a filename is given instead of a package name, the package of which
the given file belongs to can be deleted if the
.Fl F
Flag is given.
The filename needs to be absolute, see the output produced by the pkg_info
.Fl aF
command.
.Pp
If a
.Cm deinstall
script exists for the package, it is executed before and after
any files are removed.
It is this script's responsibility to clean up any additional messy details
around the package's installation, since all
.Nm
knows how to do is delete the files created in the original distribution.
The
.Ic deinstall
script is called as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.Cm deinstall
.Aq Ar pkg-name
.Ar VIEW-DEINSTALL
.Ed
before removing the package from a view, and as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.Cm deinstall
.Aq Ar pkg-name
.Ar DEINSTALL
.Ed
before deleting all files and as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent -compact
.Cm deinstall
.Aq Ar pkg-name
.Ar POST-DEINSTALL
.Ed
after deleting them.
Passing the keywords
.Ar VIEW-DEINSTALL ,
.Ar DEINSTALL
and
.Ar POST-DEINSTALL
lets you potentially write only one program/script that handles all
aspects of installation and deletion.
.Pp
All scripts are called with the environment variable
.Ev PKG_PREFIX
set to the installation prefix (see the
.Fl p
option above).
This allows a package author to write a script
that reliably performs some action on the directory where the package
is installed, even if the user might have changed it by specifying the
.Fl p
option when running
.Nm
or
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
The scripts are also called with the
.Ev PKG_METADATA_DIR
environment variable set to the location of the
.Pa +*
meta-data files, and with the
.Ev PKG_REFCOUNT_DBDIR
environment variable set to the location of the package reference counts
database directory.
If the
.Fl P
flag was given to
.Nm ,
.Ev PKG_DESTDIR
will be set to
.Ar destdir .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_DBDIR
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
If the
.Fl K
flag isn't given, then
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
is the location of the package database directory.
The default package database directory is
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Ev PKG_REFCOUNT_DBDIR
Location of the package reference counts database directory.
The default location is the path to the package database directory with
.Dq .refcount
appended to the path, e.g.
.Pa /var/db/pkg.refcount .
