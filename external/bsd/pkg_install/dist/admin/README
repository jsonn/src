Some of the options of this utility (add, delete) are *not* intended for
public release. Any work regarding the consistancy of the pkgdb should
be put into pkg_add/pkg_delete, instead of a brute-force "rebuild". 

The "rebuild" should be only needed wen upgrading from non-pkgdb-
pkg_* tools to pkgdb-pkg_* tools.
