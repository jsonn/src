.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
.Op Fl s Ar sfx_pattern
.Ar command Op args ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command performs various administrative tasks around the
.Nx
Packages System.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command-line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Print only the basenames when matching package names for
.Cm lsall
and
.Cm lsbest .
.It Fl C Ar config
Read the configuration file from
.Ar config
instead of the system default.
.It Fl d Ar lsdir
Set
.Ar lsdir
as the path to the directory in which to find matching package names for
.Cm lsall
and
.Cm lsbest .
.It Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
Set
.Ar pkg_dbdir
as the package database directory.
If this option isn't specified, then the package database directory is
taken from the value of the environment variable
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
if it's set, otherwise it defaults to
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Fl q
Perform checks in a quiet manner.
In normal operation,
.Nm
prints a
.Sq \&.
to standard output to indicate progress.
This option suppresses this progress indicator.
.It Fl S
Set the shell glob pattern for package suffixes when matching package
names for
.Cm lsall
and
.Cm lsbest
to be the null suffix.
.It Fl s Ar sfx_pattern
Set the shell glob pattern for package suffixes when matching package
names for
.Cm lsall
and
.Cm lsbest .
The default pattern is ".t[bg]z".
.It Fl V
Print version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
.El
.Pp
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm add Ar pkg ...
For each listed package, write the absolute pathnames of the files listed in
its
.Pa +CONTENTS
file together with the package they belong to into the package database.
This should be used only by
.Xr pkg_view 1 .
.It Cm audit Oo Fl es Oc Oo Fl t Ar type Oc Oo Ar pkg Oc ...
Check the listed installed packages for vulnerabilities.
If no package is given, check all installed packages.
If
.Fl e
is given, also include end-of-life information.
If
.Fl s
is given, check the signature of the pkg-vulnerabilities file before using it.
.Fl t
restricts the reported vulnerabilities to type
.Ar type .
.It Cm audit-pkg Oo Fl es Oc Oo Fl t Ar type Oc Oo Ar pkg Oc ...
Like
.Cm audit ,
but check only the given package names or patterns.
.It Cm audit-batch Oo Fl es Oc Oo Fl t Ar type Oc Oo Ar pkg-list Oc ...
Like
.Cm audit-pkg ,
but read the package names or patterns one per line from the given files.
.It Cm audit-history Oo Fl t Ar type Oc Oo Ar pkgbase Oc ...
Print all vulnerabilities for the given base package names.
.It Cm check Op Ar pkg ...
Use this command to check the files belonging to some or all of the
packages installed on the local machine against the checksum
which was recorded in the
.Pa +CONTENTS
files at package installation time.
Symbolic links also have their integrity checked against the recorded
value at package installation time.
If no additional argument is given, the files of all installed packages
are checked, else only the named packages will be checked (wildcards can
be used here, see
.Xr pkg_info 1 ) .
.Pp
The packages'
.Pa +CONTENTS
files will be parsed and the
checksum will be checked for every file found.
A warning message is printed if the expected checksum differs from the
checksum of the file on disk.
Symbolic links are also checked, ensuring that the targets on disk are
the same as the contents recorded at package installation time.
.It Cm check-pkg-vulnerabilities Oo Fl s Oc Ar file
Check format and hashes in the pkg-vulnerabilties file
.Ar file .
If
.Fl s
is given, also check the embedded signature.
.It Cm config-var Ar variable
Print the current value of
.Ar variable
as used after parsing the configuration file.
.It Cm delete Ar pkg ...
For each listed package, remove all file entries in the package database that
belong to the package.
This should be used only by
.Xr pkg_view 1 .
.It Cm dump
Dump the contents of the package database, similar to
.Cm pkg_info -F .
Columns are printed for the keyfield used in the pkgdb - the filename -,
and the data field - the package the file belongs to.
.It Cm fetch-pkg-vulnerabilities Op Fl s
Fetch a new pkg-vulnerabilities file, check the format and if
.Fl s
is given the signature.
If all checks are passed, write it to pkgdb.
.It Cm lsall Ar /dir/pkgpattern
.It Cm lsbest Ar /dir/pkgpattern
List all/best package matching pattern in the given directory
.Pa /dir .
If the
.Fl d
flag is given, then that directory path overrides
.Pa /dir .
Can be used to work around limitations of /bin/sh and other
filename globbing mechanisms.
This option implements matching of
pkg-wildcards against arbitrary files and directories, useful mainly in
the build system itself.
See
.Xr pkg_info 1
for a description of the pattern.
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal
yui# cd /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/
yui# ls unzip*
unzip-5.40.tgz  unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip*'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.40.tgz
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip\*[Ge]5.40'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.40.tgz
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall 'unzip\*[Ge]5.41'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsbest 'unzip\*[Ge]5.40'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unzip-5.41.tgz
yui# pkg_admin lsall /usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/'{mit,unproven}-pthread*'
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/mit-pthreads-1.60b6.tgz
/usr/pkgsrc/packages/i386ELF/All/unproven-pthreads-0.15.tgz
.Ed
.It Cm pmatch Ar pattern Ar pkg
Returns true if
.Ar pkg
matches
.Ar pattern ,
otherwise returns false.
.It Cm rebuild
Rebuild the package database mapping from scratch, scanning
subdirectories in
.Pa /var/db/pkg
for
.Pa +CONTENTS
files, parsing them and writing the resulting absolute pathnames
together with the package they belong to into the package database.
.Pp
This option is intended to be used for upgrading from non-pkgdb-pkg_*
tools to pkgdb-pkg_* tools, further manipulation of the pkgdb will be
done by
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_delete 1 ,
and
.Xr pkg_create 1 .
.Pp
Needs to be run as root.
.It Cm rebuild-tree
Rebuild the +REQUIRED_BY files from scratch by reresolving all dependencies.
.Pp
This option is intended to be used for fixing inconsistencies between
the records of depending and depended-on packages, such as can arise
by the use of
.Cm pkg_delete -f .
.It Cm set Ar variable=value pkg ...
Set variable with information about the installed package.
Use
.Cm unset
to remove a variable.
.Pp
Packages that are not installed directly by the user but pulled in as
dependencies are marked by setting
.Dq automatic=YES .
.It Cm unset Ar variable pkg ...
Remove an installation variable.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
If the
.Fl K
flag isn't given, then
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
is the location of the package database directory.
The default package database directory is
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
