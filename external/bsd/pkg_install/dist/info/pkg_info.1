.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_info
.Nd a utility for displaying information on software packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl BbcDdFfhIikLmNnpqrRSsVvX
.Op Fl e Ar package
.Op Fl E Ar package
.Op Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
.Op Fl l Ar prefix
.Ar pkg-name ...

.Op Fl a | Fl u
.Op flags
.Nm
.Op Fl Q Ar variable
.Ar pkg-name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to dump out information for packages, which may be either
packed up in files or already installed on the system with the
.Xr pkg_create 1
command.
.Pp
The
.Ar pkg-name
may be the name of an installed package (with our without version), a
pattern matching several installed packages (see the
.Sx PACKAGE WILDCARDS
section for a description of possible patterns),
the pathname to a
binary package, a filename belonging to an installed
package (if
.Fl F
is also given), or a URL to an ftp-available package.
.Pp
The following command-line options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
Show information for all currently installed packages.
See also
.Fl u .
.It Fl B
Show some of the important definitions used when building
the binary package (the
.Dq Build information )
for each package.
Additionally, any installation information variables
(lowercase) can be queried, too.
In particular,
.Ar automatic
tells if a package was installed automatically
as a dependency of another package.
.It Fl b
Show the
.Nx
RCS Id strings from the files used in the construction
of the binary package (the "Build version") for each package.
These files are the package Makefile, any patch files, any checksum
files, and the packing list file.
.It Fl c
Show the one-line comment field for each package.
.It Fl D
Show the install-message file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl d
Show the long-description field for each package.
.It Fl E Ar pkg-name
This option
allows you to test for the existence of a given package.
If a package identified by
.Ar pkg-name
is currently installed, return code is 0, otherwise 1.
The name of the best matching package found installed is printed to
stdout unless turned off using the
.Fl q
option.
.Ar pkg-name
can contain wildcards (see the
.Sx PACKAGE WILDCARDS
section below).
.It Fl e Ar pkg-name
This option
allows you to test for the existence of a given package.
If a package identified by
.Ar pkg-name
is currently installed, return code is 0, otherwise 1.
The names of any package(s) found installed are printed to
stdout unless turned off using the
.Fl q
option.
.Ar pkg-name
can contain wildcards (see the
.Sx PACKAGE WILDCARDS
section below).
.It Fl F
Interpret any pkg-name given as filename, and translate it to a
package name using the Package Database.
This can be used to query information on a per-file basis, e.g. in
conjunction with the
.Fl e
flag to find out which package a file belongs to.
.It Fl f
Show the packing list instructions for each package.
.It Fl I
Show the index entry for each package.
.It Fl i
Show the install script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl K Ar pkg_dbdir
Set
.Ar pkg_dbdir
as the package database directory.
If this option isn't specified, then the package database directory is
taken from the value of the environment variable
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
if it's set, otherwise it defaults to
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
.It Fl k
Show the de-install script (if any) for each package.
.It Fl L
Show the files within each package.
This is different from just viewing the packing list, since full pathnames
for everything are generated.
Files that were created dynamically during installation of the package
are not listed.
.It Fl l Ar str
Prefix each information category header (see
.Fl q )
shown with
.Ar str .
This is primarily of use to front-end programs that want to request a
lot of different information fields at once for a package, but don't
necessary want the output intermingled in such a way that they can't
organize it.
This lets you add a special token to the start of each field.
.It Fl m
Show the mtree file (if any) for each package.
.It Fl N
Show which packages each package was built with (exact dependencies), if any.
.It Fl n
Show which packages each package needs (depends upon), if any.
.It Fl p
Show the installation prefix for each package.
.It Fl Q
Show the definition of
.Ar variable
from the build information for each package.
An empty string is returned if no such variable definition is found for
the package(s).
.It Fl q
Be
.Dq quiet
in emitting report headers and such, just dump the
raw info (basically, assume a non-human reading).
.It Fl R
For each package, show the packages that require it.
.It Fl r
For each package, show the packages that require it.
Continue recursively to show all dependents.
.It Fl S
Show the size of this package and all the packages it requires,
in bytes.
.It Fl s
Show the size of this package in bytes.
The size is calculated by adding up the size of each file of the package.
.It Fl u
Show information for all user-installed packages.
Automatically installed packages (as dependencies
of other packages) are not displayed.
See also
.Fl a .
.It Fl V
Print version number and exit.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl X
Print summary information for each package.
The summary format is
described in
.Xr pkg_summary 5 .
Its primary use is to contain all information about the contents of a
(remote) binary package repository needed by package managing software.
.El
.Sh TECHNICAL DETAILS
Package info is either extracted from package files named on the
command line, or from already installed package information
in
.Pa /var/db/pkg/\*[Lt]pkg-name\*[Gt] .
.Pp
A filename can be given instead of a (installed) package name to query
information on the package this file belongs to.
This filename is then resolved to a package name using the Package Database.
For this translation to take place, the
.Fl F
flag must be given.
The filename must be absolute, compare the output of pkg_info
.Fl aF .
.Sh PACKAGE WILDCARDS
In the places where a package name/version is expected, e.g. for the
.Fl e
switch, several forms can be used.
Either use a package name with or without version, or specify a
package wildcard that gets matched against all installed packages.
.Pp
Package wildcards use
.Xr fnmatch 3 .
In addition,
.Xr csh 1
style {,} alternates have been implemented.
Package version numbers can also be matched in a relational manner
using the
.Pa \*[Ge] , \*[Le] , \*[Gt] ,
and
.Pa \*[Lt]
operators.
For example,
.Pa pkg_info -e 'name\*[Ge]1.3'
will match versions 1.3 and later of the
.Pa name
package.
Additionally, ranges can be defined by giving a lower bound with
\*[Gt] or \*[Ge] and an upper bound with \*[Lt] or \*[Le].
The lower bound has to come first.
For example,
.Pa pkg_info -e 'name\*[Ge]1.3\*[Lt]2.0'
will match versions 1.3 (inclusive) to 2.0 (exclusive)
of package
.Pa name .
.Pp
The collating sequence of the various package version numbers is
unusual, but strives to be consistent.
The magic string
.Dq alpha
equates to
.Pa alpha version
and sorts before a beta version.
The magic string
.Dq beta
equates to
.Pa beta version
and sorts before a release candidate.
The magic string
.Dq rc
equates to
.Pa release candidate
and sorts before a release.
The magic string
.Dq pre ,
short for
.Dq pre-release ,
is a synonym for
.Dq rc .
For example,
.Pa name-1.3rc3
will sort before
.Pa name-1.3
and after
.Pa name-1.2.9 .
Similarly
.Pa name-1.3alpha2
will sort before
.Pa name-1.3beta1
and they both sort before
.Pa name-1.3rc1 .
In addition, alphabetic characters sort in the same place as
their numeric counterparts, so that
.Pa name-1.2e
has the same sorting value as
.Pa name-1.2.5
The magic string
.Dq pl
equates to a
.Pa patch level
and has the same value as a dot in the dewey-decimal ordering schemes.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PKG_DBDIR
.It Ev PKG_DBDIR
If the
.Fl K
flag isn't given, then
.Ev PKG_DBDIR
is the location of the package database directory.
The default package database directory is
.Pa /var/db/pkg .
