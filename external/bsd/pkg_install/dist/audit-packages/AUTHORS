* The functions that deal with finding packages such as fixpkgname()
  foundpkg() and checkforpkg() were taken from the pkg_install
  set of tools.  Authors for this include Jordan Hubbard, John Kohl,
  Alistair Crooks, Hubert Feyrer, Thorsten Frueauf, Rene Hexel,
  Christian E. Hopps, Thomas Klausner, Johnny Lam, and Matthias Scheler.

* This is basically a re-write in C of the audit-packages tool
  by Adrian Portelli (adrianp@NetBSD.org).  The tool was originally 
  authored by Alistair G. Crooks (agc@NetBSD.org).
