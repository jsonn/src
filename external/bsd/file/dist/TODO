Fix output so that tests for MIME and APPLE flags are not needed all
over the place, and actual output is only done in one place. This

pick the last-pushed (most specific, one hopes) value at the end, or
use a default if the list is empty.

Continue to squash all magic bugs. See Debian BTS for a good source.

Store arbitrarily long strings, for example for %s patterns, so that
they can be printed out. Fixes Debian bug #271672.

Add syntax for other sorts of counted string (Debian bug #466032). Use
to fix bug #283760.

Add syntax for relative offsets after current level (Debian bug #466037).
