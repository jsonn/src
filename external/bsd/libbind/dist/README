Introduction

	ISC's libbind provides the standard resolver library,
	along with header files and documentation, for communicating
	with domain name servers, retrieving network host entries
	from /etc/hosts or via DNS, converting CIDR network addresses,
	perform Hesiod information lookups, retrieve network entries
	from /etc/networks, implement TSIG transaction/request
	security of DNS messages, perform name-to-address and
	address-to-name translations, utilize /etc/resolv.conf
	for resolver configuration.

	It contains many of the same historical functions and headers
	included with many Unix operating systems.

	Originally written for BIND 8, it was included in BIND 9 as
	optionally-compiled code through release 9.5.  It has been
	removed from subsequent releases of BIND 9 and is now
	provided as a separate package.

Building

	The libbind library requires a system with an ANSI C compiler
	and basic POSIX support.

	To build, just

		./configure
		make

	Several environment variables that can be set before running
	configure will affect compilation:

	    CC
		The C compiler to use.	configure tries to figure
		out the right one for supported systems.

	    CFLAGS
		C compiler flags.  Defaults to include -g and/or -O2
		as supported by the compiler.  

	    STD_CINCLUDES
		System header file directories.	 Can be used to specify
		where add-on thread or IPv6 support is, for example.
		Defaults to empty string.

	    STD_CDEFINES
		Any additional preprocessor symbols you want defined.
		Defaults to empty string.

		Possible settings:
		Change the default syslog facility of named/lwresd.
		  -DISC_FACILITY=LOG_LOCAL0	
		Enable DNSSEC signature chasing support in dig.
		  -DDIG_SIGCHASE=1 (sets -DDIG_SIGCHASE_TD=1 and
				    -DDIG_SIGCHASE_BU=1)
		Disable dropping queries from particular well known ports.
		  -DNS_CLIENT_DROPPORT=0
		Sibling glue checking in named-checkzone is enabled by default.
		To disable the default check set.  -DCHECK_SIBLING=0
		named-checkzone checks out-of-zone addresses by default.
		To disable this default set.  -DCHECK_LOCAL=0
		Enable workaround for Solaris kernel bug about /dev/poll
		  -DISC_SOCKET_USE_POLLWATCH=1
		  The watch timeout is also configurable, e.g.,
		  -DISC_SOCKET_POLLWATCH_TIMEOUT=20

	    LDFLAGS
		Linker flags. Defaults to empty string.

	The following need to be set when cross compiling.

	    BUILD_CC
		The native C compiler.
	    BUILD_CFLAGS (optional)
	    BUILD_CPPFLAGS (optional)
		Possible Settings:
		-DNEED_OPTARG=1		(optarg is not declared in <unistd.h>)
	    BUILD_LDFLAGS (optional)
	    BUILD_LIBS (optional)

	"make install" will install the library.  By default, installation
	is into /usr/local, but this can be changed with the "--prefix"
	option when running "configure".

	To see additional configure options, run "configure --help".

	If you need to re-run configure please run "make distclean" first.
	This will ensure that all the option changes take.

Notes on Usage

        - Installing both libbind and BIND 9 on the same system
          will produce two incompatible header files with similar
          names: $PREFIX/include/isc/list.h (from BIND 9) and
          $PREFIX/include/bind/isc/list.h (from libbind).  When
          compiling code against libbind, be sure to set -I flags
          appropriately.

Documentation

	Man pages for libbind routines, in *roff and plaintext format,
	are included with the release.
