	sinh(arg) returns the hyperbolic sign of its floating-
	point argument.

	The exponential function is called for arguments
	greater in magnitude than 0.5.
	The result overflows and 'huge' is returned for
	arguments greater than somewhat.

	A series is used for arguments smaller in magnitude than 0.5.
	The coeffieients are #2029 from Hart & Cheney. (20.36D)

	cosh(arg) is computed from the exponential function for
	all arguments.
