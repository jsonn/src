/*
 * This explanation of _alloca() comes from Chris Giese, posted to
 * alt.os.dev:
 *
 * By default, Windows reserves 1 meg of virtual memory for the stack.
 * No page of stack memory is actually allocated (commited) until the
 * page is accessed.  This is demand-allocation.  The page beyond the
 * top of the stack is the guard page.  If this page is accessed,
 * memory will be allocated for it, and the guard page moved downward
 * by 4K (one page).  Thus, the stack can grow beyond the initial 1 meg.
 * Windows will not, however, let you grow the stack by accessing
 * discontiguous pages of memory.  Going beyond the guard page causes
 * an exception.  Stack-probing code prevents this.
