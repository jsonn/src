$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.16.2.2 2008/10/19 22:40:56 haad Exp $

plan:
	- build modular-xorg stuff with reach over

	- everyone gets lib, share and bin

	- initially, only xorg happy platforms get Xserver.  other older
	  platforms with xsrc-based servers will build those.


things to handle:
	- figure out a saner way to handle .man.pre files.


big items:

libs		- done
			-- libGL has has glapi_x86.S commented out from the
			   build because it spews when eating -traditional-cpp
			   cheap whitespace hacks have been discussed or
			   phone suggested we only pass -traditional-cpp to
			   platforms where assemblers do things with '#'.

tools		- done
share		- done
bin		- done
Xserver 
	drivers:
		- all mostly done.
		- need to figure out which ones should be built for which
		  platforms?

		- need to make hw/xfree86 link Xorg
		- hw/xgl is not done
		- xorgcfg and xorgconfig are not done


things to delete:
- lbx is dead, kill it
