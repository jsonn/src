.IR OldVolumeGroup { Path | Name | UUID }

.SH DESCRIPTION
vgrename renames an existing (see
.B vgcreate(8)
) volume group from
.IR OldVolumeGroup { Name | Path | UUID }
to
.IR NewVolumeGroup { Name | Path }.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.SH Examples
"vgrename /dev/vg02 /dev/my_volume_group" renames existing
volume group "vg02" to "my_volume_group".
.TP
"vgrename vg02 my_volume_group" does the same.
.TP
"vgrename Zvlifi-Ep3t-e0Ng-U42h-o0ye-KHu1-nl7Ns4 VolGroup00_tmp"
changes the name of the Volume Group with UUID
Zvlifi-Ep3t-e0Ng-U42h-o0ye-KHu1-nl7Ns4 to 
"VolGroup00_tmp".

All the Volume Groups visible to a system need to have different
names.  Otherwise many LVM2 commands will refuse to run or give
warning messages.

This situation could arise when disks are moved between machines.  If
a disk is connected and it contains a Volume Group with the same name
as the Volume Group containing your root filesystem the machine might
not even boot correctly.  However, the two Volume Groups should have
different UUIDs (unless the disk was cloned) so you can rename
one of the conflicting Volume Groups with
\fBvgrename\fP.
