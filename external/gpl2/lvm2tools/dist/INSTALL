LVM2 installation
=================

1) Install device-mapper

   Ensure the device-mapper has been installed on the machine.

   The device-mapper should be in the kernel (look for 'device-mapper'
   messages in the kernel logs) and /usr/include/libdevmapper.h 
   and libdevmapper.so should be present.

   The device-mapper is available from:
     ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/


2) Generate custom makefiles.

   Run the 'configure' script from the top directory.

   If you wish to use the built-in LVM2 shell and have GNU readline 
   installed (http://www.gnu.org/directory/readline.html) use:
     ./configure --enable-readline

   If you don't want to include the LVM1 backwards-compatibility code use:
     ./configure --with-lvm1=none 

   To separate the LVM1 support into a shared library loaded by lvm.conf use:
     ./configure --with-lvm1=shared


3) Build and install LVM2.

   Run 'make install' from the top directory.


4) Create a configuration file

   The tools will work fine without a configuration file being
   present, but you ought to review the example file in doc/example.conf.
   For example, specifying the devices that LVM2 is to use can
   make the tools run more efficiently - and avoid scanning /dev/cdrom!

Please also refer to the WHATS_NEW file and the manual pages for the 
individual commands.
