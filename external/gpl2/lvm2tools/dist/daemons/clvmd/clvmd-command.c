/*

  CLVMD Cluster LVM daemon command processor.

  To add commands to the daemon simply add a processor in do_command and return
  and messages back in buf and the length in *retlen. The initial value of
  buflen is the maximum size of the buffer. if buf is not large enough then it
  may be reallocated by the functions in here to a suitable size bearing in
  mind that anything larger than the passed-in size will have to be returned
  using the system LV and so performance will suffer.

  The status return will be negated and passed back to the originating node.

  pre- and post- command routines are called only on the local node. The
  purpose is primarily to get and release locks, though the pre- routine should
  also do any other local setups required by the command (if any) and can
  return a failure code that prevents the command from being distributed around
  the cluster

  The pre- and post- routines are run in their own thread so can block as long
  they like, do_command is run in the main clvmd thread so should not block for
  too long. If the pre-command returns an error code (!=0) then the command
  will not be propogated around the cluster but the post-command WILL be called

  Also note that the pre and post routine are *always* called on the local
  node, even if the command to be executed was only requested to run on a
  remote node. It may peek inside the client structure to check the status of
  the command.

  The clients of the daemon must, naturally, understand the return messages and
  codes.

  Routines in here may only READ the values in the client structure passed in
  apart from client->private which they are free to do what they like with.
