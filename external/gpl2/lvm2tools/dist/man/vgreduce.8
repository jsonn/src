.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vgreduce
[\-a/\-\-all] [\-A/\-\-autobackup y/n] [\-d/\-\-debug] [\-h/\-?/\-\-help]
[\-\-removemissing]
[\-t/\-\-test]

.SH DESCRIPTION
vgreduce allows you to remove one or more unused physical volumes
from a volume group.
.SH OPTIONS
See \fBlvm\fP for common options.
.TP
.I \-a, \-\-all
Removes all empty physical volumes if none are given on command line.
.TP
.I \-\-removemissing
Removes all missing physical volumes from the volume group and makes 
the volume group consistent again.  

It's a good idea to run this option with --test first to find out what it 
would remove before running it for real.  

Any logical volumes and dependent snapshots that were partly on the 
missing disks get removed completely. This includes those parts 
that lie on disks that are still present.

If your logical volumes spanned several disks including the ones that are
lost, you might want to try to salvage data first by activating your
logical volumes with --partial as described in \fBlvm (8)\fP.
