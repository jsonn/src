The content of the tarball is as follows:
.br
- dmsetup info
.br
- table of currently running processes
.br
- recent entries from /var/log/messages (containing system messages)
.br
- complete lvm configuration and cache
.br
- list of device nodes present under /dev
.br
- if enabled with -m, metadata dump will be also included
.br
- if enabled with -a, debug output of vgscan, pvscan and list of all available volume groups, physical volumes and logical volumes will be included

.SH OPTIONS

\fBWARNING\fR: if lvm is already hung, then this script may hang as well if \fB\-a\fR is used
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \(em gather LVM metadata from the PVs
This option generates a 1:1 dump of the metadata area from all PVs visible to the system, which can cause the dump to increase in size considerably. However, the metadata dump may represent a valuable diagnostic resource.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR directory \(em dump into a directory instead of tarball
By default, lvmdump will produce a single compressed tarball containing all the information. Using this option, it can be instructed to only produce the raw dump tree, rooted in \fBdirectory\fP.
