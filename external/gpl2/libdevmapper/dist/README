This directory tree contains the supporting userspace files
(libdevmapper and dmsetup) you need when working with device-mapper.  

The patches subdirectory also includes up-to-date device-mapper kernel 
patches for 2.4.26-rc1 and old patches for 2.4.20, 2.4.21 and 2.4.22 
onwards.  2.6 kernels already contain the device-mapper core, but (as at 
March 2004) you need to apply development patches if you want snapshot 
and pvmove functionality.

For more information about device-mapper please read the INTRO file.
Installation instructions are in INSTALL.

for device-mapper, including additional patches undergoing development
and testing:
