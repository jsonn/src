BUGS:
-----
* fix "to <ifname>" bug on FreeBSD 2.2.8
fastroute works

===============================================================================
GENERAL:
--------

* use fr_tcpstate() with NAT code for increased NAT usage security or even
  fr_checkstate() - suspect this is not possible.

time permitting:

* load balancing across interfaces

* record buffering for TCP/UDP

* modular application proxying
on the way

* keep fragment information for state entries automatically.
done for NAT

* allow multiple ip addresses in a source route list for ipsend

* complete Linux port to implement all the IP Filter features
return-rst done, to/dup-to/fastroute remain - ip_forward() problems :-(

* add a flag to automate src spoofing

* ipfsync() should change IP#'s in current mappings as well as what's
  in rules.
 
* document bimap

* document NAT rule order processing

* add more docs
in progress

* fix up where manual pages go for Solaris2
