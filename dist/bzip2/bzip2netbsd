# bzip2netbsd:  convert a bzip2 source tree into a
# netbsd bzip2 source tree, under basesrc/dist,
# based on the other *2netbsd scripts in the NetBSD source tree
#
# Rough instructions for importing new bzip2 release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/bzip2/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/dist/bzip2/bzip2netbsd bzip2-1.x.y `pwd`
#	$ cd basesrc/dist/bzip2
#	$ cvs import -m "Import bzip2 1.x.y" basesrc/dist/bzip2 JSEWARD bzip2-1-x-y
#	$ cd ../../..
#	$ rm -r basesrc bzip2-1.x.y
#
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
