.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpcd.conf
.Nd dhcpcd configuration file 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Although
.Nm dhcpcd
can do everything from the command line, there are cases where it's just easier
to do it once in a configuration file.
Most of the options found in
.Xr dhcpcd 8
can be used here.
The first word on the line is the option and the rest of the line is the value.
Leading and trailing whitespace for the option and value are trimmed.
You can escape characters in the value using the \\ character.
.Pp
Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
.Pp
Here's a list of available options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic classid Ar string
Change the default classid sent from dhcpcd-version.
If not set then none is sent.
.It Ic clientid Ar string
Change the default clientid sent from the interface hardware address.
If the string is of the format 01:02:03 then it is encoded as hex.
If not set then none is sent.
.It Ic duid
Generate an
.Rs
.%T "RFC 4361"
.Re
compliant clientid.
This requires persistent storage and not all DHCP servers work with it so it's
not enabled by default.
The duid generated will be held in
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.duid
and should not be copied to other hosts.
.It Ic hostname Ar name
Sends specified
.Ar hostname 
to the DHCP server so it can be registered in DNS. If
.Ar hostname
if a FQDN (ie, contains a .) then it will be encoded as such.
.It Ic fqdn Op none | ptr | both
none disables FQDN encoding, ptr just asks the DHCP server to update the PTR
record of the host in DNS whereas both also updates the A record.
The current hostname or the hostname specified using the
.Fl h , -hostname
option must be a FQDN.
.Nm dhcpcd
itself never does any DNS updates.
.It Ic interface Ar interface
Subsequent options are only parsed for this
.Ar interface .
.It Ic leasetime Ar seconds
Request a leasetime of
.Ar seconds .
.It Ic noarp
Don't send any ARP requests.
This also disables IPv4LL.
.It Ic nogateway
Don't install any default routes.
.It Ic nohook Ar script
Don't run this hook script.
Matches full name, or prefixed with 2 numbers optionally ending with
.Pa .sh .
.It Ic noipv4ll
Don't attempt to obtain an IPv4LL address if we failed to get one via DHCP.
See
.Rs
.%T "RFC 3927"
.Re
.It Ic option Ar dhcp-option
Requests the
.Ar dhcp-option
from the server.
It can be a variable to be used in
.Xr dhcpcd-run-hooks 8
or the numerical value.
You can specify more seperated by commas, spaces or more option lines.
.It Ic script Ar script
Use
.Ar script
instead of the default
.Pa @SCRIPT@ .
.It Ic timeout Ar seconds
The default timeout for waiting for a DHCP response is 20 seconds which may
be too long or too short and can be changed here.
.It Ic userclass Ar string
Tag the DHCP messages with the userclass.
You can specify more than one.
