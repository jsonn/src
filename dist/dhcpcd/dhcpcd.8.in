.Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an implementation of the DHCP client specified in
.Rs
.%T "RFC 2131"
.Re
.Nm
gets the host information
.Po 
IP address, routes, etc
.Pc
from a DHCP server and configures the network
.Ar interface
of the
machine on which it is running. 
.Nm
will then write DNS information to
.Xr resolvconf 8 ,
if available, otherwise directly to
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf .
If the hostname is currenly blank, (null) or localhost then
.Nm
will set the hostname to the one supplied by the DHCP server.
.Nm
then daemonises and waits for the lease renewal time to lapse.
Then it attempts to renew its lease and reconfigure if the new lease changes.
.Ss Local Link configuration
If
.Nm
failed to obtain a lease, it will probe for a valid IPv4LL address
.Po
aka Zeroconf, aka APIPA
.Pc .
Once obtained it will probe every 10 seconds for a DHCP server to get a
proper address.
.Pp
Even when
.Nm
obtains a proper lease, it will still add a Local Link route
.Po
165.254.0.0/16
.Pc
so that the host can communicate with clients using these addresses.
.Pp
When using IPv4LL,
.Nm
will always succeed and return a 0 exit code. To disable this behaviour, you
can use the
.Fl L , -noipv4ll
option.
.Ss Hooking into DHCP events
.Nm
will run
.Pa @SCRIPT@ ,
or the script specified by the
.Fl c , -script
option.
This script will run each script found in
.Pa @HOOKDIR@
in a lexical order.
The default installation supplies the scripts
.Pa test ,
.Pa resolv.conf
and
.Pa hostname .
You can disable each script by using the
.Fl C , -nohook
option.
See
.Xr dhcpcd-run-hooks 8
for details on how these scripts work.
.Nm
currently ignores the exit code of the script.
.Ss Fine tuning
You can fine tune the behaviour of
.Nm
with the following options:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c , -script Ar script
Use this
.Ar script
instead of the default
.Pa @SCRIPT@ .
.It Fl d , -debug
Echo debug and informational messages to the console.
Subsequent debug options stop
.Nm
from daemonising.
.It Fl f , -config Ar file
Specify a config to load instead of
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.conf .
.Nm
always processes the config file before any command line options.
.It Fl h , -hostname Ar hostname
By default,
.Nm
will send the current hostname to the DHCP server so it can register in DNS.
You can use this option to specify the
.Ar hostname
sent, or an empty string to
stop any
.Ar hostname
from being sent.
.It Fl i , -classid Ar classid
Override the DHCP vendor
.Ar classid
field we send. The default is
dhcpcd <version>.
If not set then none is sent.
.It Fl k , -release
This causes an existing
.Nm
process running on the
.Ar interface
to release it's lease, deconfigure the
.Ar interface
and then exit.
.It Fl l , -leasetime Ar seconds
Request a specific lease time in
.Ar seconds .
By default
.Nm
does not request any lease time and leaves the it in the hands of the
DHCP server.
.It Fl m , -metric Ar metric
Added routes will use the
.Ar metric
on systems where this is supported
.Po
presently only Linux
.Pc .
Route metrics allow the addition of routes to the same destination across
different interfaces, the lower the metric the more it is preferred.
.It Fl o , -option Ar option
Request the DHCP
.Ar option
variable for use in
.Pa @SCRIPT@ .
.It Fl n , -renew
Notifies an existing
.Nm
process running on the
.Ar interface
to renew it's lease. If
.Nm
is not running, then it starts up as normal.
.It Fl p , -persistent
.Nm
normally deconfigures the
.Ar interface
and configuration when it exits.
Sometimes, this isn't desirable if for example you have root mounted over NFS.
You can use this option to stop this from happening.
.It Fl r , -request Op Ar address
.Nm
normally sends a DHCP Broadcast to find servers to offer an address.
.Nm
will then request the address used.
You can use this option to skip the broadcast step and just request an
.Ar address .
The downside is if you request an
.Ar address
the DHCP server does not know about or the DHCP server is not
authorative, it will remain silent.
In this situation, we go back to the init state and broadcast again.
If no
.Ar address
is given then we use the first address currently assigned to the
.Ar interface .
.It Fl s , -inform Op Ar address Op / Ar cidr
Behaves exactly like
.Fl r , -request
as above, but sends a DHCP inform instead of a request.
This requires the interface to be configured first.
This does not get a lease as such, just notifies the DHCP server of the
.Ar address
we are using.
If we fail to contact a DHCP server then we return a failure instead of falling
back on IPv4LL.
.It Fl t , -timeout Ar seconds
Timeout after
.Ar seconds ,
instead of the default 20.
A setting of 0
.Ar seconds
causes
.Nm
to wait forever to get a lease.
.It Fl u , -userclass Ar class
Tags the DHCP message with the userclass
.Ar class .
DHCP servers use this give memebers of the class DHCP options other than the
default, without having to know things like hardware address or hostname.
.It Fl D , -duid 
Generate an
.Rs
.%T "RFC 4361"
.Re
compliant clientid.
This requires persistent storage and not all DHCP servers work with it so it's
not enabled by default.
The DUID generated will be held in
.Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.duid
and should not be copied to other hosts.
.It Fl E , -lastlease
If
.Nm
cannot obtain a lease, then try to use the last lease we got for the
interface if it hasn't yet expired.
.It Fl F , -fqdn Ar fqdn
Requests that the DHCP server updates DNS using FQDN instead of just a
hostname.
Valid values for
.Ar fqdn
are none, ptr and both.
The current hostname or the hostname specified using the
.Fl h , -hostname
option must be a FQDN.
.Nm
itself never does any DNS updates.
.It Fl I , -clientid Ar clientid
Change the default clientid sent from the interface hardware address.
If the string is of the format 01:02:03 then it is encoded as hex.
If not set then none is sent.
.El
.Ss Restriciting behaviour
.Nm
will try to do as much as it can by default.
However, there are sometimes situations where you don't want the things to be
configured exactly how the the DHCP server wants.
Here are some option that deal with turning these bits off.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A , -noarp
Don't request or claim the address by ARP.
.It Fl G , -nogateway
Don't set any default routes.
.It Fl C , -nohook Ar script
Don't run this hook script.
Matches full name, or prefixed with 2 numbers optionally ending with
.Pa .sh .
.Pp
So to stop dhcpcd from touching your DNS settings you would do:-
.D1 dhcpcd -C resolv.conf
.It Fl L , -noipv4ll
Don't use IPv4LL at all.
.It Fl O , -nooption Ar option
Don't request the specified option.
If no option given, then don't request any options other than those to
configure the interface and routing.
.It Fl T, -test
On receipt of discover messages we just call
.Pa @SCRIPT@
with the reason of TEST which echo's the DHCP variables found in the message
to the console.
The interface configuration isn't touched and neither are any configuration
files.
.It Fl V, -variables
Display a list of option codes and the associated variable for use in
.Xr dhcpcd-run-hooks 8 .
.El
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
requires a Berkley Packet Filter, or BPF device on BSD based systems and a
Linux Socket Filter, or LPF device on Linux based systems.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -ohang
.It Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.conf
Configuration file for dhcpcd.
If you always use the same options, put them here.
.It Pa @SYSCONFDIR@/dhcpcd.duid
Text file that holds the DUID used to identify the host.
.It Pa @SCRIPT@
Bourne shell script that is run when we configure or deconfigure an interface.
.It Pa @HOOKDIR@
A directory containing bourne shell scripts that are run by the above script.
Each script can be disabled by using the
.Fl C , -nohook
option described above.
.It Pa @DBDIR@/dhcpcd\- Ns Ar interface Ns .lease
The actual DHCP message send by the server. We use this when reading the last
lease and use the files mtime as when it was issued.
