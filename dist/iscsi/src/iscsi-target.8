.Nm
is the server for
iSCSI
requests from iSCSI initiators.
.Nm
listens for discovery and login requests on the required port,
and responds to those requests appropriately.
.Pp
Options and operands available for
.Nm iscsi-target :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
.Nm
will listen for IPv4 connections,
and respond back using IPv4.
This is the default address family.
.It Fl 6
.Nm
will listen for IPv6 connections,
and respond back using IPv6.
.It Fl b Ar blocksize
Specify the underlying block size for iSCSI storage which will be served.
The possible sizes are: 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096 bytes, with the default
being 512 bytes.
.It Fl D
When this option is specified,

not become a daemon.
This can be useful for debugging purposes.
.It Fl f Ar configfile

.Ar net
to show network-related information,
.Ar iscsi
to show iSCSI protocol-related information,
.Ar scsi
to show SCSI protocol information, and
