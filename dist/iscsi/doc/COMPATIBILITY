The NetBSD iSCSI initiator has been tried with the following initiators:

Seems to work fine - instructions in place at

(This is the initiator that is used to test new releases)

2. Solaris 10 Express 06/04
Tested by Alistair Crooks
Only a small test case was tried
VPD83 functionality was added for this initiator

3. IBM AIX 5.3 iSCSI initiator
