The NetBSD iSCSI HOWTO
======================

This document is intended to tell you how to set up an iSCSI target on
a NetBSD host, so that block storage can be presented to the network. 
It then goes on to show how to connect to that storage using the
Microsoft iSCSI initiator (version 1.06, running on Windows XP).


1. Configuring the NetBSD iSCSI target
======================================

1.1. Decide what storage will be presented

The iSCSI target serves up block storage to clients on the network.
These clients are called "initiators". Firstly, we must decide how
much storage we are going to serve up, and for this document, we
will serve up 100 MB. It will be in a file called /tmp/iscsi-target0.

So we must first edit /etc/iscsi/targets, so that it contains the
following lines:

	# extent        file or device          start           length
	extent0         /tmp/iscsi-target0      0               100MB

	# target        flags   storage                 netmask
	target0         rw      extent0                 0/0

The extent definition tells the file which is used as backing
store. It is persistent, so that the target can serve up the
same storage after reboot. Its length is 100 MB, and there is
no offset into the file for the start of the extent. (An offset
is useful if you need to skip over MBRs, or disklabels).

The extent is mounted read-write by "target0", and is served up
to any host (the 0.0.0.0/0 netmask).

1.2. Start the iscsi-target

Issue the command:

	# /etc/rc.d/iscsi_target forcestart

and you should see the messages from the iscsi-target:

	Starting iscsi_target.
	Reading configuration from `/etc/iscsi/targets'
	target0:rw:0/0
		extent0:/tmp/iscsi-target0:0:104857600
	DISK: 1 logical units (204800 blocks, 512 bytes/block), type iscsi fs
	DISK: LU 0: 100 MB disk storage for "target0"
	TARGET: TargetName is iqn.1994-04.org.netbsd.iscsi-target

1.3 You're done!

Congratulations - your iSCSI target is now up and running and
serving blocks to initiators.



2. Configuring the Microsoft iSCSI initiator, version 1.06
