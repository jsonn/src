.Sh DESCRIPTION
Test programs written using the ATF libraries all share a common user
interface, which is what this manual page describes.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form, the test program will execute the listed
test cases, or all of them if none are provided as arguments.
The test cases' names can be given as glob patterns.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form, the test program will list all available
test cases alongside a brief description of what they do.
If any arguments are specified, the list will be restricted to the
matching test cases.
The test cases' names can be given as glob patterns.
.Pp
In the third synopsis form, the test program will print information
about all supported options and their purpose.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XvXvarXvalueXX
.It Fl h
Shows a short summary of all available options and their purpose.
.It Fl l
Lists available test cases alongside a brief description for each of them.
.It Fl r Ar fd
Specifies the file descriptor to which the test case will redirect its
results.
These results follow a machine-parseable standardized format, and are not
meant for direct user consumption.
See
.Xr atf-formats 5
for more details.
.It Fl s Ar srcdir
The path to the directory where the test program is located.
This is needed in all cases, except when the test program is being executed
from the current directory.
The test program will use this path to locate any helper data files or
utilities.
.It Fl v Ar var=value
Sets the configuration variable
.Ar var
to the value
.Ar value .
