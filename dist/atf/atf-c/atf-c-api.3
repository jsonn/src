.Ed
.Ss Definition of test cases
Test cases have an identifier and are composed of three different parts:
the header, the body and an optional cleanup routine, all of which are
described in
.Xr atf-test-case 8 .
To define test cases, one can use the
.Fn ATF_TC
or the
.Fn ATF_TC_WITH_CLEANUP
macros, which take a single parameter specifiying the test case's name.
The former does not allow the specification of a cleanup routine for the
test case while the latter does.
It is important to note that these
.Em do not
set the test case up for execution when the program is run.
In order to do so, a later registration is needed with the
.Fn ATF_TP_ADD_TC
macro detailed in
.Sx Program initialization .
.Pp
Later on, one must define the three parts of the body by means of three
functions.
Their headers are given by the
.Fn ATF_TC_HEAD ,
.Fn ATF_TC_BODY
and
.Fn ATF_TC_CLEANUP
macros, all of which take the test case name provided to the
.Fn ATF_TC
or
.Fn ATF_TC_WITH_CLEANUP
macros.
Following each of these, a block of code is expected, surrounded by the
opening and closing brackets.
.Ss Program initialization
The library provides a way to easily define the test program's
.Fn main
function.
You should never define one on your own, but rely on the
library to do it for you.
This is done by using the
.Fn ATF_TP_ADD_TCS
macro, which is passed the name of the object that will hold the test
cases; i.e. the test program instance.
This name can be whatever you want as long as it is a valid variable
identifier.
.Pp
After the macro, you are supposed to provide the body of a function, which
should only use the
.Fn ATF_TP_ADD_TC
macro to register the test cases the test program will execute and return
a success error code.
The first parameter of this macro matches the name you provided in the
former call.
The success status can be returned using the
.Fn atf_no_error
function.
.Ss Header definitions
The test case's header can define the meta-data by using the
.Fn atf_tc_set_md_var
method, which takes two parameters: the first one specifies the
meta-data variable to be set and the second one specifies its value.
Both of them are strings.
.Ss Configuration variables
The test case has read-only access to the current configuration variables
by means of the
.Ft bool
.Fn atf_tc_has_config_var
and the
.Ft const char *
.Fn atf_tc_get_config_var
methods, which can be called in any of the three parts of a test case.
.Ss Access to the source directory
It is possible to get the path to the test case's source directory from any
of its three components by querying the
.Sq srcdir
configuration variable.
.Ss Requiring programs
Aside from the
.Va require.progs
meta-data variable available in the header only, one can also check for
additional programs in the test case's body by using the
.Fn atf_tc_require_prog
function, which takes the base name or full path of a single binary.
Relative paths are forbidden.
If it is not found, the test case will be automatically skipped.
.Ss Test case finalization
The test case finalizes either when the body reaches its end, at which
point the test is assumed to have
.Em passed ,
or at any explicit call to
.Fn atf_tc_pass ,
.Fn atf_tc_fail
or
.Fn atf_tc_skip .
These three functions terminate the execution of the test case immediately.
The cleanup routine will be processed afterwards in a completely automated
way, regardless of the test case's termination reason.
.Pp
.Fn atf_tc_pass
does not take any parameters.
.Fn atf_tc_fail
and
.Fn atf_tc_skip
take a single string that describes why the test case failed or
was skipped, respectively.
It is very important to provide a clear error message in both cases so that
the user can quickly know why the test did not pass.
.Ss Helper macros for common checks
The library provides several macros that are very handy in multiple
situations.
These basically check some condition after executing a given statement or
processing a given expression and, if the condition is not met, they
automatically call
.Fn atf_tc_fail
with an appropriate error message.
.Pp
.Fn ATF_CHECK
takes an expression and raises a failure if it evaluates to false.
.Pp
.Fn ATF_CHECK_EQUAL
takes two expressions and raises a failure if the two do not evaluate to
the same exact value.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following shows a complete test program with a single test case that
validates the addition operator:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <atf-c.h>

ATF_TC(addition);
ATF_TC_HEAD(addition)
{
    atf_tc_set_md_var("descr", "Sample tests for the addition operator");
}
ATF_TC_BODY(addition)
{
    ATF_CHECK_EQUAL(0 + 0, 0);
    ATF_CHECK_EQUAL(0 + 1, 1);
    ATF_CHECK_EQUAL(1 + 0, 1);

    ATF_CHECK_EQUAL(1 + 1, 2);

    ATF_CHECK_EQUAL(100 + 200, 300);
}

ATF_TP_ADD_TCS(tp)
{
    ATF_TP_ADD_TC(tp, addition);

    return atf_no_error();
}
