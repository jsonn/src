Detailed list of changes
========================

ATF does not use this file because the detailed list of changes is
available where it was meant to be: in the source code repository.
The repository's history contains a much more detailed list of changes
than what could be represented here, including ancestry graphs, patches
between revisions and digital signatures of every change.

In order to access the repository, please visit ATF's web site for more
instructions.  At the time of this writing, the site was located at:

    http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/atf/

Also, at the time of this writing, the version control system used to
manage the ATF source code tree was Monotone, whose last known address
was:

    http://www.monotone.ca/

Additionally you can find the list of the most important changes between
formal releases in the NEWS file.
