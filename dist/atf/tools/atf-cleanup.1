.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility that removes files and directories recursively, but doing
it in a safe manner to avoid crossing mount point boundaries.
Before the removal of a given tree,
.Nm
will look for file systems mounted anywhere inside it and try to unmount
them.
If all mount points were properly unmounted, it later proceeds to do the
real removal.
This tool is used internally by test programs to clean up the test cases'
work directories, as they may have left other file systems mounted inside
them.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
proceeds to scan and remove all the given files or directories.
