Relicensed code
===============

The following code snippets have been taken from other projects.
Even though they were not originally licensed under the terms above,
the original authors have agreed to relicense their work so that
this project can be distributed under a single license.  This section
is put here just to clarify this fact.

* configure.ac, Makefile.am: The original versions were derived from
  the ones in the XML Catalog Manager project, version 2.2.
  Author: Julio M. Merino Vidal <jmmv@users.sourceforge.net>

* atf/ui.cpp: The format_paragraph and format_text functions were
  derived form the ones in the Monotone project,
  revision 3a0982da308228d796df35f98d787c5cff2bb5b6.
  Author: Julio M. Merino Vidal <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

* atf/io.hpp, atf/io.cpp, tests/units/t_io.cpp: These files were derived
  from the file_handle, systembuf, pipe, pistream and postream classes
  and tests found in the Boost.Process library.
  Author: Julio M. Merino Vidal <jmmv84@gmail.com>

* admin/check-style.sh, admin/check-style-common.awk,
  admin/check-style-cpp.awk, admin/check-style-shell.awk: These files,
  except the first one, were first implemented in the Buildtool project.
  They were later adapted to be part of Boost.Process and, during that
  process, the shell script was created.
