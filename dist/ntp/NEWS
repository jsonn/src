NTP 4.2.4p2 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2007/06/19)

Focus: Minor Bugfixes

This release fixes a multicast mode authentication problem, 
an error in NTP packet handling on Windows that could lead to 
ntpd crashing, and several other minor bugs. Handling of 
multicast interfaces and logging configuration were improved. 
The required versions of autogen and libopts were incremented.
This is a recommended upgrade for Windows and multicast users.

NTP 4.2.4 (Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org>, 2006/12/31)

Focus: enhancements and bug fixes.

Dynamic interface rescanning was added to simplify the use of ntpd in 
conjunction with DHCP. GNU AutoGen is used for its command-line options 
processing. Separate PPS devices are supported for PARSE refclocks, MD5 
signatures are now provided for the release files. Drivers have been 
added for some new ref-clocks and have been removed for some older 
ref-clocks. This release also includes other improvements, documentation 
and bug fixes. 

K&R C is no longer supported as of NTP-4.2.4. We are now aiming for ANSI 
C support.
