.I sntp
can be used as a SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either display
the time or set the local system's time (given suitable privilege).  It can be
run as an interactive command or in a
.I cron
job.
NTP is the Network Time Protocol (RFC 1305) and SNTP is the
Simple Network Time Protocol (RFC 2030, which supersedes RFC 1769).

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},
the aginfo template and the option descriptions for the @command{sntp} program.  It documents the sntp usage text and option meanings.

@node sntp ipv4
@subsection ipv4 option (-4)
@cindex sntp-ipv4

This is the ``force ipv4 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.

@node sntp ipv6
@subsection ipv6 option (-6)
@cindex sntp-ipv6

This is the ``force ipv6 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.

@node sntp unprivport
@subsection unprivport option (-u)
@cindex sntp-unprivport

This is the ``use an unprivileged port'' option.
Use an unprivilegded UDP port for our queries.

@node sntp normalverbose
@subsection normalverbose option (-v)
@cindex sntp-normalverbose

This is the ``slightly verbose'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
extraverbose, megaverbose.
@end itemize

Diagnostic messages for non-fatal errors and a limited amount of
tracing should be written to standard error.  Fatal ones always
produce a diagnostic.  This option should be set when there is a
suspected problem with the server, network or the source.

@node sntp extraverbose
@subsection extraverbose option (-V)
@cindex sntp-extraverbose

This is the ``extra verbose'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
normalverbose, megaverbose.
@end itemize

Produce more and less comprehensible output, mainly for investigating
problems with apparently inconsistent timestamps.  This option should
be set when the program fails with a message indicating that is the
trouble.

@node sntp megaverbose
@subsection megaverbose option (-W)
@cindex sntp-megaverbose

This is the ``mega verbose'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
normalverbose, extraverbose.
@end itemize

Very verbose debugging output that will interfere with the timing
when writing to the terminal (because of line buffered output from C).
Note that the times produced by this are the corrections needed, and
not the error in the local clock.  This option should be set only when
debugging the source.

@node sntp settimeofday
@subsection settimeofday option (-r)
@cindex sntp-settimeofday

This is the ``set (step) the time with settimeofday()'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
adjtime.
@end itemize



@node sntp adjtime
@subsection adjtime option (-a)
@cindex sntp-adjtime

This is the ``set (slew) the time with adjtime()'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
settimeofday.
@end itemize
