# ntp2netbsd:  convert a ntp source tree into a
# netbsd ntp source tree, under src/dist,
# based on bind2netbsd by Bernd Ernesti
#
# Rough instructions for importing new NTP release:
#
#	$ cd /some/where/temporary
#	$ tar xpfz /new/ntp/release/tar/file
#	$ sh /usr/src/dist/ntp/ntp2netbsd ntp-4.x.y `pwd`
#	$ cd src/dist/ntp
#	$ cvs import -m "Import ntp 4.x.y" src/dist/ntp UDEL ntp-4-x-y
#	$ cd ../../../ntp-4.x.y
#	$ run ./configure  --enable-all-clocks --enable-parse-clocks
#	$ cp config.h /usr/src/usr.sbin/ntp/include
#         - not really - we have some changed defaults and the vax port has no ieee.h support.
#           so do a careful diff and patch - Frank Kardel
#	$ cp scripts/mkver /usr/src/usr.sbin/ntp/scripts
#	$ cd ..
#	$ rm -r src ntp-4.x.y
#	$ cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/ntp
#	$ cvs commit -m "Updated autoconf generated files for ntp 4.x.y."
#
#	- check makefiles to see if any extra sources have been added,
#	  esp. libntp and ntpd.
#	- check for and remove img tags in html docs.
#	- update distrib/sets if necessary.
