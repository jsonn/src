			  AM-UTILS-6.0 TASKS TODO

Please volunteer to do any of the following:

- complete testing of untested platforms in INSTALL file
	ncr2
	sunos 3.5

- autofs support: see README.autofs for details.
	needs to be re-ported to solaris 2.6 (headers changed)

- deal with everything that has XXX on it in the sources
- documentation update ("XXX: FILL IN" sections).

- hlfsd should be able to not use /var/alt_mail, but send code 75 back to
  sendmail (telling it to re-queue the mail and retry later).

- compatibility with Sun's automount maps?
	should be easier via the amd.conf file to specify type of map
	perhaps done at the same time autofs support is done.

- a selector ala if_exists() for networkmask(1.2.3.4/5.6.7.8), will match
  against all known IP addresses of this host.

- convert to using my own rpcgen .x files for amq/amq/nfs (v2 and v3)

- support multiple "fail-over" NFS mounts in Solaris 2.6.

- use packaging info for various OSs (such as RPM, Redhat Package Format)

- $mindelay and $maxdelay in milliseconds

- multiple nfsl should be matched if one matched and nfs mount failed.  fall
  through.
- fall through syntax?  opts:=nofail,fallthrough?

- random nfs rhost:={srv1, srv2, srv3}

- nfslx, same as nfsl, but using linkx

- find out why this sometimes works and sometimes not:
	mcl	-rhost:=minetta host!=${rhost};type:=nfs host==${rhost}

- loadable info_*, amfs_*, and ops_* modules (lazy evaluation).

- hlfsd for ~root/.mailspool (getpwnam("root"))
- hlfsd should daemonize even if -DDEBUG, then use -D nofork

- fixmount should use generic code from transp/transp_{tli,sockets}.c

- report netbsd/openbsd bugs in BUGS file

- reverse notion of -F and other cmd-line options, so they override the
amd.conf file (right now amd.conf overrides cmd-line options).

- y2k compliance.

- an un/install script for binaries

- update README

- add am-utils URL and COPYRIGHT to all distributed scripts and sources and
  programs etc. also to amq -v output.

- ion: browsable_dirs only works for nis if in [global] broken if it is file
  maps.

- all if statements should have an else clause because of Ultrix's /bin/sh.

- look for obsolete AM_* macros and use newer AC_* ones
- use 3rd arg to AC_CHECK_TYPE (headers)

- FreeBSD 3.1 doesn't have SYMTTL flag, so the mtime of the hlfsd symlink is
  always new.  This breaks hlfsd on FreeBSD 3.1, b/c the acregmin/max code
  depends on the time that the symlink was created.  Solution: best is to
  support NOAC in the FreeBSD kernel, otherwise hlfsd will have to know not
  to turn on this code in hlfsd/stubs.c:

    if (++slinkfattr.na_mtime.nt_useconds == 0)
      ++slinkfattr.na_mtime.nt_seconds;

- support nqnfs as per Jeffrey C Honig <jch@BSDI.COM>: "Besides having
  NFSMNT_NQNFS set when you try to do the mount, NQNFS requires that you do
  the nfssvc() call to create an nqnfs client daemon.  I can't see any
  obvious way to check if the server supports NQNFS."

- browsable 'auto' style maps.

- amq man page: amq -f also reloads maps that are not updated

- mention signals in amd man page

- ALLOWED_MOUNT_TIME of 40 seconds is way too long!
- need option to turn off pings of portmapper before trying a mount

- type:=program should not require umount command. can use defult
  umount(). it works for smbmount/umount.

- document var[0-7] variables/selectors

- need a way to export a nfs-mount point after it is being mounted (jukebox
  mounts).  can do this with type:=program.

- support port=n, for machines that use NFS on a different port
