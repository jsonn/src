dnl set OS libraries specific to an OS:
dnl libnsl/libsocket are needed only on solaris and some svr4 systems.
dnl Using a typical macro has proven unsuccesful, because on some other
dnl systems such as irix, including libnsl and or libsocket actually breaks
dnl lots of code.  So I am forced to use a special purpose macro that sets
dnl the libraries based on the OS.  Sigh.  -Erez.
