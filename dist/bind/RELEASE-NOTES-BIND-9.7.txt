New Features

9.7.2

     * Zones may be dynamically added and removed with the "rndc addzone"
       and "rndc delzone" commands. These dynamically added zones are
       written to a per-view configuration file. Do not rely on the
       configuration file name nor contents as this will change in a
       future release. This is an experimental feature at this time.
     * Added new "filter-aaaa-on-v4" access control list to select which
       IPv4 clients have AAAA record filtering applied.
     * A new command "rndc secroots" was added to dump a combined summary
       of the currently managed keys combined with statically configured
       trust anchors.
     * Added support to load new keys into managed zones without signing
       immediately with "rndc loadkeys". Added support to link keys with
       "dnssec-keygen -S" and "dnssec-settime -S".

9.7.2-P1

   None.

9.7.2-P2

   None.

9.7.2-P3

   None.

Feature Changes

9.7.2

     * Documentation improvements
     * ORCHID prefixes were removed from the automatic empty zone list.
     * Improved handling of GSSAPI security contexts. Specifically, better
       memory management of cached contexts, limited lifetime of a context
       to 1 hour, and added a "realm" command to nsupdate to allow
       selection of a non-default realm name.
     * The contributed tool "zkt" was updated to version 1.0.

9.7.2-P1

   None.

9.7.2-P2

   None.

9.7.2-P3

   None.

Security Fixes

9.7.2

   None.

9.7.2-P1

     * If BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validating server, has two or more
       trust anchors configured in named.conf for the same zone (such as
       example.com) and the response for a record in that zone from the
       authoritative server includes a bad signature, the validating
       server will crash while trying to validate that query.

9.7.2-P2

     * A flaw where the wrong ACL was applied was fixed. This flaw allowed
       access to a cache via recursion even though the ACL disallowed it.

9.7.2-P3

     * Adding a NO DATA signed negative response to cache failed to clear
       any matching RRSIG records already in cache. A subsequent lookup of
       the cached NO DATA entry could crash named (INSIST) when the
       unexpected RRSIG was also returned with the NO DATA cache entry.
       [RT #22288] [CVE-2010-3613] [VU#706148]
     * BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validator, was determining if the NS RRset
       is insecure based on a value that could mean either that the RRset
       is actually insecure or that there wasn't a matching key for the
       RRSIG in the DNSKEY RRset when resuming from validating the DNSKEY
       RRset. This can happen when in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm
       rollover, when two different algorithms were used to sign a zone
       but only the new set of keys are in the zone DNSKEY RRset. [RT
       #22309] [CVE-2010-3614] [VU#837744]
     * When BIND is running as an authoritative server for a zone and
       receives a query for that zone data, it first checks for
       allow-query acls in the zone statement, then in that view, then in
       global options. If none of these exist, it defaults to allowing any
       query (allow-query {"any"};).
       With this bug, if the allow-query is not set in the zone statement,
       it failed to check in view or global options and fell back to the
       default of allowing any query. This means that queries that the
       zone owner did not wish to allow were incorrectly allowed. [RT
       #22418] [CVE-2010-3615] [VU#510208]

Bug Fixes

9.7.2

     * Removed a warning message when running BIND 9 under Windows for
       when a TCP connection was aborted. This is a common occurrence and
       the warning was extraneous.
     * Worked around a race condition in the cache database memory
       handling. Without this fix a DNS cache DB or ADB could incorrectly
       stay in an over memory state, effectively refusing further caching,
       which subsequently made a BIND 9 caching server unworkable.
     * Partially disabled change 2864 because it would cause infinite
       attempts of RRSIG queries.
     * BIND did not properly handle non-cacheable negative responses from
       insecure zones. This caused several non-protocol-compliant zones to
       become unresolvable. BIND is now more accepting of responses it
       receives from less strict servers.

9.7.2-P1

     * A bug, introduced in BIND 9.7.2, caused named to fail to start if a
       master zone file was unreadable or missing. This has been corrected
       in 9.7.2-P1.
     * BIND previously accepted answers from authoritative servers that
       did not provide a "proper" response, such as not setting AA bit.
       BIND was changed to be more strict in what it accepted but this
       caused operational issues. This new strictness has been backed out
       in 9.7.2-P1.

9.7.2-P2

   None.

9.7.2-P3

     * Microsoft changed the behavior of sockets between NT/XP based
       stacks vs Vista/windows7 stacks. Server 2003/2008 have the older
       behavior, 2008r2 has the new behavior. With the change, different
       error results are possible, so ISC adapted BIND to handle the new
       error results. This resolves an issue where sockets would shut down
       on Windows servers causing named to stop responding to queries. [RT
       #21906]
     * Windows has non-POSIX compliant behavior in its rename() and
       unlink() calls. This caused journal compaction to fail on Windows
       BIND servers with the log error: "dns_journal_compact failed:
       failure". [RT #22434]

Known issues in this release

     * "make test" will fail on OSX and possibly other operating systems.
       The failure occurs in a new test to check for allow-query ACLs. The
       failure is caused because the source address is not specified on
       the dig commands issued in the test.
       If running "make test" is part of your usual acceptance process,
       please edit the file bin/tests/system/allow_query/test.sh and add
       -b 10.53.0.2
       to the DIGOPTS line.
