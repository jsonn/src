Security Fixes

9.4-ESV-R4

     * Adding a NO DATA signed negative response to cache failed to clear
       any matching RRSIG records already in cache. A subsequent lookup of
       the cached NO DATA entry could crash named (INSIST) when the
       unexpected RRSIG was also returned with the NO DATA cache entry.
       [RT #22288] [CVE-2010-3613] [VU#706148]
     * BIND, acting as a DNSSEC validator, was determining if the NS RRset
       is insecure based on a value that could mean either that the RRset
       is actually insecure or that there wasn't a matching key for the
       RRSIG in the DNSKEY RRset when resuming from validating the DNSKEY
       RRset. This can happen when in the middle of a DNSKEY algorithm
       rollover, when two different algorithms were used to sign a zone
       but only the new set of keys are in the zone DNSKEY RRset. [RT
       #22309] [CVE-2010-3614] [VU#837744]

Bug Fixes

9.4-ESV-R4

     * isc_print_vsnprintf() failed to check if there was space available
       in the buffer when adding a left justified character with a non
       zero width, (e.g. "%-1c"). [RT #22270]
     * win32: add more dependencies to BINDBuild.dsw. [RT #22062]
