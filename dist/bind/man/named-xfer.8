.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ic Named-xfer
is an ancillary program executed by
.Xr named 8
to perform an inbound zone transfer.  It is rarely executed directly, and then
only by system administrators who are trying to debug a zone transfer problem.
See RFC's 1033, 1034, and 1035 for more information on the Internet
name-domain system.
.Pp
Options are:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl z Ar zone_to_transfer
specifies the name of the zone to be transferred.
.It Fl f Ar db_file
specifies the name of the 
.Ar db_file 
into which the zone should be dumped
when it is received from the primary server.
.It Fl s Ar serial_no
specifies the serial number of our current copy of this zone.  If the
.Sy SOA RR 
we get from the primary server does not have a serial
number higher than this, the transfer will be aborted.
.It Fl d Ar debuglevel
Print debugging information.
The 
.Ar debuglevel 
is a number determines the level of messages printed.
.It Fl l Ar debug_log_file
Specifies a log file for debugging messages.  The default is system- 
dependent but is usually in
.Pa /var/tmp
or
.Pa /usr/tmp .
Note that this only applies if
.Dq Fl d
is also specified.
.It Fl i Ar ixfr_file
Specifies the name of the 
.Ar ixfr_file 
into which the zone changes from Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR)
should be dumped when it is received from the primary server.
.It Fl t Ar trace_file
Specifies a 
.Ar trace_file 
which will contain a protocol trace of the zone
transfer.  This is probably only of interest to people debugging the name
server itself.
.It Fl p Ar port#
Use a different port number.  The default is the standard port number
as returned by 
.Xr getservbyname 3  
for the service 
.Dq Li domain .
.It Fl S
Perform a restricted transfer of only the SOA, NS records and glue A records
for the zone. The SOA record will not be loaded by 
.Xr named 8
but will be used to
determine when to verify the NS records.  See the 
.Dq Li stubs 
directive in
.Xr named 8
for more information.
.El
.Pp
Additional arguments are taken as name server addresses in so-called
.Dq dotted-quad 
syntax 
.Em only ;
no host name are allowed here.  At least one address must be specified.  
Any additional addresses will be tried, in order, if the first one fails 
to transfer to us successfully.
The 
.Sy axfr 
or 
.Sy ixfr 
after name server address designates the type of zone transfer to perform.
Use 
.Sy axfr  
for a full zone transfer or
.Sy ixfr 
for an incremental zone transfer.
