.Sh NAME
.Nm ndc
.Nd name daemon control program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ndc
.Op Fl c Ar channel
.Op Fl l Ar localsock
.Op Fl p Ar pidfile
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl t
.Op Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command allows the system administrator to control the operation
of a name server.  If no
.Ar command
is given,
.Ic ndc
will prompt for commands until it reads EOF.
.Pp
Options are:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl c Ar channel
Specifies the rendezvous point for the control channel.  The default is
.Pa /var/run/ndc
(a UNIX domain socket which is also the server's default control channel).
If the desired control channel is a TCP/IP socket, then the format of the
.Ar channel
argument is
.Sy ipaddr/port
(for example,
.Sy 127.0.0.1/54
would be TCP port 54 on the local host.)
.It Fl l Ar localsock
This option will
.Xr bind 2
the client side of the control channel to a specific address.  Servers can
be configured to reject connections which do not come from specific addresses.
The format is the same as for
.Ar channel
(see above).
.It Fl p Ar pidfile
For backward compatibility with older name servers,
.Ic ndc
is able to use UNIX signals for control communications.  This capability is
optional in modern name servers and will disappear altogether at some future
time.  Note that the available
.Ar command
set is narrower when the signal interface is used.  A likely
.Ar pidfile
argument would be something like
.Pa /var/run/named.pid .
.It Fl d
Turns on debugging output, which is of interest mainly to developers.
.It Fl q
Suppresses prompts and result text.
.It Fl s
Suppresses nonfatal error announcements.
.It Fl t
Turns on protocol and system tracing, useful in installation debugging.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
Several commands are built into
.Ic ndc ,
but the full set of commands supported by the name server is dynamic and
should be discovered using the
.Ar help
command (see below).  Builtin commands are:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ar /help
Provides help for builtin commands.
.It Ar /exit
Exit from
.Ic ndc
command interpreter.
.It Ar /trace
Toggle tracing (see
.Fl -t
description above).
.It Ar /debug
Toggle debugging (see
.Fl d
description above).
.It Ar /quiet
Toggle quietude (see
.Fl q
description above).
.It Ar /silent
Toggle silence (see
.Fl s
description above).
.El
.Sh NOTES
If running in
.Ar pidfile
mode, any arguments to
.Ar start
and
.Ar restart
commands are passed to the new
.Ic named
on its command line.  If running in
.Ar channel
mode, there is no
.Ar start
command and the
.Ar restart
command just tells the name server to
.Xr execvp 2
itself.
