This directory in BIND contains the Domain Signature Tools (dst)
library.  It was written by Trusted Information Systems, Inc. and
integrated into BIND by John Gilmore.  It is used as a generic
crypto library interface by the DNS Security code in BIND.

	  Installing Domain Signature Tools Library - dst

1. Assess available crypto libraries:

	if you have DNSSAFE (the default)
		CRYPTFLAGS must include -DDNSSAFE
		CRYPTINCL must include -I../dnssafe

	if you have RSAREF 
		CRYPTFLAGS must include -DRSAREF 
		CRYPTINCL must include -I<path to rsa include files>
		
	if you have BSAFE 
		CRYPTFLAGS must include -DBSAFE
		CRYPTINCL must include -I<path to bsafe include files>

	if you want HMAC-MD5 support 
		CRYPTFLAGs must include -DHMAC	

2. Building BIND as usual will include the dst library routines into
   libbind.a, and link them into the BIND programs that use crypto
   support.
