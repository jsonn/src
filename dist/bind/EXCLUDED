			SOA or NS records whose owner names are not equal
			equal to or parents of the query name should be

1143.	[bug]		When a trusted-keys statement was present and named
			was built without crypto support, it would leak memory.
			[ Not applicable to 9.2 ]

1150.	[bug]		named incorrectly accepted TTL values

1255.	[bug]		When verifying that an NXT proves nonexistence, check
			the rcode of the message and only do the matching NXT
			check.  That is, for NXDOMAIN responses, check that
			the name is in the range between the NXT owner and
			next name, and for NOERROR NODATA responses, check
			that the type is not present in the NXT bitmap.
			[required changes from DS support]

1271.	[bug]		"recursion available: {denied,approved}" was too

			[RT #3653]

1392.	[bug]		named-checkzone: update usage.
