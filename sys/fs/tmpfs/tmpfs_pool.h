/*
 * tmpfs uses variable-length strings to store file names and to store
 * link targets.  Reserving a fixed-size buffer for each of them is
 * inefficient because it will consume a lot more memory than is really
 * necessary.  However, managing variable-sized buffers is difficult as
 * regards memory allocation and very inefficient in computation time.
 * This is why tmpfs provides an hybrid scheme to store strings: string
 * pools.
 *
 * A string pool is a collection of memory pools, each one with elements
 * of a fixed size.  In tmpfs's case, a string pool contains independent
 * memory pools for 16-byte, 32-byte, 64-byte, 128-byte, 256-byte,
 * 512-byte and 1024-byte long objects.  Whenever an object is requested
 * from the pool, the new object's size is rounded to the closest upper
 * match and an item from the corresponding pool is returned.
