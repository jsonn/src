- File meta-data is stored using memory pools.  These use, at the moment,
  wired kernel memory, which is not acceptable because it is easy to turn
  the system unstable by exhausting it.  Therefore, a pool allocator that
  uses anonymous memory has to be written.

- Verify that file holes work (they should, but must be checked).  Add a
  regression test for this feature.

- NFS support is broken.  The readdir operation does not work well; it
  mostly works when wcc is disabled (which happens as soon as doing a `touch
  foo' over the NFS mount point).  However, files created in the original
  file system do not appear in the NFS mount point until another file
  is created over it.

- Fix and complete code marked with `XXX' and `TODO' tags.
