/*
 * tmpfs provides a custom pool allocator mostly to exactly keep track of
 * how many memory is used for each file system instance.  These pools are
 * never shared across multiple mount points for the reasons described
 * below:
 *
 * - It is very easy to control how many memory is associated with a
 *   given file system.  tmpfs provides a custom pool allocator that
 *   controls memory usage according to previously specified usage
 *   limits, by simply increasing or decreasing a counter when pages
 *   are allocated or released, respectively.
 *
 *   If the pools were shared, we could easily end up with unaccounted
 *   memory, thus taking incorrect decisions on the amount of memory
 *   use.  As an example to prove this point, consider two mounted
 *   instances of tmpfs, one mounted on A and another one on B. Assume
 *   that each memory page can hold up to four directory entries and
 *   that, for each entry you create on A, you create three on B
 *   afterwards.  After doing this, each memory page will be holding an
 *   entry from A and three for B.  If you sum up all the space taken by
 *   the total amount of allocated entries, rounded up to a page
 *   boundary, that number will match the number of allocated pages, so
 *   everything is fine.
 *
 *   Now suppose we unmount B.  Given that the file system has to
 *   disappear, we have to delete all the directory entries attached to
 *   it.  But the problem is that freeing those entries will not release
 *   any memory page.  Instead, each page will be filled up to a 25%,
 *   and the rest, a 75%, will be lost.  Not lost in a strict term,
 *   because the memory can be reused by new entries, but lost in the
 *   sense that it is not accounted by any file system.  Despite A will
 *   think it is using an amount 'X' of memory, it will be really using
 *   fourth times that number, thus causing mistakes when it comes to
 *   decide if there is more free space for that specific instance of
 *   tmpfs.
 *
 * - The number of page faults and cache misses is reduced given that all
 *   entries of a given file system are stored in less pages.  Note that
 *   this is true because it is common to allocate and/or access many
 *   entries at once on a specific file system.
 *
 *   Following the example given above, listing a directory on file system
 *   A could result, in the worst case scenario, in fourth times more page
 *   faults if we shared the pools.
