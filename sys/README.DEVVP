There is an XXXDEVVP at each chunk of code that I think is
suspect, and needs to be carefully reviewed.  In particular:

	* wsmux.c -- really need to rethink the way this is done.

	* d_size routines in disk drivers -- should consider changing
	  this interface.  It's just a little disgusting, but is used
	  because you might already e.g. have the partition open that
	  you want to dump on (e.g. dump on swap partition).

	* sequencer.c -- what happens here is horrifying.  But I'm
	  not sure how to deal with it.

	* Should a revoke still kill all vnodes for a device, even
	  if they are clones?

	* Need to be consistent about the locking state of a vnode when
	  open/close is called. Currently this varies per device class
	  (char/block), and if FNONBLOCK was passed or not.
