/*
 * The following documentation tries to describe the relationship between the
 * various structures defined in this file:
 *
 * each adapter type has a scsi_adapter struct. This describes the adapter and
 *    identifies routines that can be called to use the adapter.
 * each device type has a scsi_device struct. This describes the device and
 *    identifies routines that can be called to use the device.
 * each existing device position (scsibus + target + lun)
 *    can be described by a scsi_link struct.
 *    Only scsi positions that actually have devices, have a scsi_link
 *    structure assigned. so in effect each device has scsi_link struct.
 *    The scsi_link structure contains information identifying both the
 *    device driver and the adapter driver for that position on that scsi bus,
 *    and can be said to 'link' the two.
 * each individual scsi bus has an array that points to all the scsi_link
 *    structs associated with that scsi bus. Slots with no device have
 *    a NULL pointer.
 * each individual device also knows the address of it's own scsi_link
 *    structure.
 *
 *				-------------
 *
 * The key to all this is the scsi_link structure which associates all the
 * other structures with each other in the correct configuration.  The
 * scsi_link is the connecting information that allows each part of the
 * scsi system to find the associated other parts.
