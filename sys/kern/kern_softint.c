/*
 * Generic software interrupt framework.
 *
 * Overview
 *
 *	The soft interrupt framework provides a mechanism to schedule a
 *	low priority callback that runs with thread context.  It allows
 *	for dynamic registration of software interrupts, and for fair
 *	queueing and prioritization of those interrupts.  The callbacks
 *	can be scheduled to run from nearly any point in the kernel: by
 *	code running with thread context, by code running from a
 *	hardware interrupt handler, and at any interrupt priority
 *	level.
 *
 * Priority levels
 *
 *	Since soft interrupt dispatch can be tied to the underlying
 *	architecture's interrupt dispatch code, it can be limited
 *	both by the capabilities of the hardware and the capabilities
 *	of the interrupt dispatch code itself.  The number of priority
 *	levels is restricted to four.  In order of priority (lowest to
 *	highest) the levels are: clock, bio, net, serial.
 *
 *	The names are symbolic and in isolation do not have any direct
 *	connection with a particular kind of device activity: they are
 *	only meant as a guide.
 *
 *	The four priority levels map directly to scheduler priority
 *	levels, and where the architecture implements 'fast' software
 *	interrupts, they also map onto interrupt priorities.  The
 *	interrupt priorities are intended to be hidden from machine
 *	independent code, which should use thread-safe mechanisms to
 *	synchronize with software interrupts (for example: mutexes).
 *
 * Capabilities
 *
 *	Software interrupts run with limited machine context.  In
 *	particular, they do not posess any address space context.  They
 *	should not try to operate on user space addresses, or to use
 *	virtual memory facilities other than those noted as interrupt
 *	safe.
 *
 *	Unlike hardware interrupts, software interrupts do have thread
 *	context.  They may block on synchronization objects, sleep, and
 *	resume execution at a later time.
 *
 *	Since software interrupts are a limited resource and run with
 *	higher priority than most other LWPs in the system, all
 *	block-and-resume activity by a software interrupt must be kept
 *	short to allow futher processing at that level to continue.  By
 *	extension, code running with process context must take care to
 *	ensure that any lock that may be taken from a software interrupt
 *	can not be held for more than a short period of time.
 *
 *	The kernel does not allow software interrupts to use facilities
 *	or perform actions that may block for a significant amount of
 *	time.  This means that it's not valid for a software interrupt
 *	to: sleep on condition variables, use the lockmgr() facility,
 *	or wait for resources to become available (for example,
 *	memory).
 *
 * Per-CPU operation
 *
 *	If a soft interrupt is triggered on a CPU, it can only be
 *	dispatched on the same CPU.  Each LWP dedicated to handling a
 *	soft interrupt is bound to its home CPU, so if the LWP blocks
 *	and needs to run again, it can only run there.  Nearly all data
 *	structures used to manage software interrupts are per-CPU.
 *
 *	The per-CPU requirement is intended to reduce "ping-pong" of
 *	cache lines between CPUs: lines occupied by data structures
 *	used to manage the soft interrupts, and lines occupied by data
 *	items being passed down to the soft interrupt.  As a positive
 *	side effect, this also means that the soft interrupt dispatch
 *	code does not need to to use spinlocks to synchronize.
 *
 * Generic implementation
 *
 *	A generic, low performance implementation is provided that
 *	works across all architectures, with no machine-dependent
 *	modifications needed.  This implementation uses the scheduler,
 *	and so has a number of restrictions:
 *
 *	1) Since software interrupts can be triggered from any priority
 *	level, on architectures where the generic implementation is
 *	used IPL_SCHED must be equal to IPL_HIGH (it must block all
 *	interrupts).
 *
 *	2) The software interrupts are not currently preemptive, so
 *	must wait for the currently executing LWP to yield the CPU. 
 *	This can introduce latency.
 *
 *	3) A context switch is required for each soft interrupt to be
 *	handled, which can be quite expensive.
 *
 * 'Fast' software interrupts
 *
 *	If an architectures defines __HAVE_FAST_SOFTINTS, it implements
 *	the fast mechanism.  Threads running either in the kernel or in
 *	userspace will be interrupted, but will not be preempted.  When
 *	the soft interrupt completes execution, the interrupted LWP
 *	is resumed.  Interrupt dispatch code must provide the minimum
 *	level of context necessary for the soft interrupt to block and
 *	be resumed at a later time.  The machine-dependent dispatch
 *	path looks something like the following:
 *
 *	softintr()
 *	{
 *		go to IPL_HIGH if necessary for switch;
 *		save any necessary registers in a format that can be
 *		    restored by cpu_switchto if the softint blocks;
 *		arrange for cpu_switchto() to restore into the
 *		    trampoline function;
 *		identify LWP to handle this interrupt;
 *		switch to the LWP's stack;
 *		switch register stacks, if necessary;
 *		assign new value of curlwp;
 *		call MI softint_dispatch, passing old curlwp and IPL
 *		    to execute interrupt at;
 *		switch back to old stack;
 *		switch back to old register stack, if necessary;
 *		restore curlwp;
 *		return to interrupted LWP;
 *	}
 *
 *	If the soft interrupt blocks, a trampoline function is returned
 *	to in the context of the interrupted LWP, as arranged for by
 *	softint():
 *
 *	softint_ret()
 *	{
 *		unlock soft interrupt LWP;
 *		resume interrupt processing, likely returning to
 *		    interrupted LWP or dispatching another, different
 *		    interrupt;
 *	}
 *
 *	Once the soft interrupt has fired (and even if it has blocked),
 *	no further soft interrupts at that level will be triggered by
 *	MI code until the soft interrupt handler has ceased execution. 
 *	If a soft interrupt handler blocks and is resumed, it resumes
 *	execution as a normal LWP (kthread) and gains VM context.  Only
 *	when it has completed and is ready to fire again will it
 *	interrupt other threads.
