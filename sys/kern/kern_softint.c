/*
 * Generic software interrupt framework.
 *
 * Overview
 *
 *	The soft interrupt framework provides a mechanism to schedule a
 *	low priority callback that runs with thread context.  It allows
 *	for dynamic registration of software interrupts, and for fair
 *	queueing and prioritization of those interrupts.  The callbacks
 *	can be scheduled to run from nearly any point in the kernel: by
 *	code running with thread context, by code running from a
 *	hardware interrupt handler, and at any interrupt priority
 *	level.
 *
 * Priority levels
 *
 *	Since soft interrupt dispatch can be tied to the underlying
 *	architecture's interrupt dispatch code, it may be limited by
 *	both by the capabilities of the hardware and the capabilities
 *	of the interrupt dispatch code itself.  Therefore the number of
 *	levels is restricted to four.  In order of priority (lowest to
 *	highest) the levels are: clock, bio, net, serial.
 *
 *	The symbolic names are provided only as guide and in isolation
 *	do not have any direct connection with a particular kind of
 *	device activity.
 *
 *	The four priority levels map directly to scheduler priority
 *	levels, and where the architecture implements 'fast' software
 *	interrupts, they also map onto interrupt priorities.  The
 *	interrupt priorities are intended to be hidden from machine
 *	independent code, which should use multiprocessor and
 *	preemption aware mechanisms to synchronize with software
 *	interrupts (for example: mutexes).
 *
 * Capabilities
 *
 *	As with hardware interrupt handlers, software interrupts run
 *	with limited machine context.  In particular, they do not
 *	posess any VM (virtual memory) context, and should therefore
 *	not try to operate on user space addresses, or to use virtual
 *	memory facilities other than those noted as interrupt safe.
 *
 *	Unlike hardware interrupts, software interrupts do have thread
 *	context.  They may block on synchronization objects, sleep, and
 *	resume execution at a later time.  Since software interrupts
 *	are a limited resource and (typically) run with higher priority
 *	than all other threads in the system, all block-and-resume
 *	activity by a software interrupt must be kept short in order to
 *	allow futher processing at that level to continue.  The kernel
 *	does not allow software interrupts to use facilities or perform
 *	actions that may block for a significant amount of time.  This
 *	means that it's not valid for a software interrupt to: sleep on
 *	condition variables, use the lockmgr() facility, or wait for
 *	resources to become available (for example, memory).
 *
 *	Software interrupts may block to await ownership of locks,
 *	which are typically owned only for a short perioid of time:
 *	mutexes and reader/writer locks.  By extension, code running in
 *	the bottom half of the kernel must take care to ensure that any
 *	lock that may be taken from a software interrupt can not be
 *	held for more than a short period of time.
 *
 * Per-CPU operation
 *
 *	Soft interrupts are strictly per-CPU.  If a soft interrupt is
 *	triggered on a CPU, it will only be dispatched on that CPU. 
 *	Each LWP dedicated to handling a soft interrupt is bound to
 *	it's home CPU, so if the LWP blocks and needs to run again, it
 *	can only run there.  Nearly all data structures used to manage
 *	software interrupts are per-CPU.
 *
 *	Soft interrupts can occur many thousands of times per second. 
 *	In light of this, the per-CPU requirement is intended to solve
 *	three problems:
 *
 *	1) For passing work down from a hardware interrupt handler to a
 *	software interrupt (for example, using a queue) spinlocks need
 *	not be used to guarantee data integrity.  Adjusting the CPU
 *	local interrupt priority level is sufficient.  Acquiring
 *	spinlocks is computationally expensive, as it increases traffic
 *	on the system bus and can stall processors with long execution
 *	pipelines.
 *
 *	2) Often hardware interrupt handlers manipulate data structures
 *	and then pass those to a software interrupt for further
 *	processing.  If those data structures are immediately passed to
 *	another CPU, the associated cache lines may be forced across
 *	the system bus, generating more bus traffic.
 *
 *	3) The data structures used to manage soft interrupts are also
 *	CPU local, again to reduce unnecessary bus traffic.
 *
 * Generic implementation
 *
 *	A generic, low performance implementation is provided that
 *	works across all architectures, with no machine-dependent
 *	modifications needed.  This implementation uses the scheduler,
 *	and so has a number of restrictions:
 *
 *	1) Since software interrupts can be triggered from any priority
 *	level, on architectures where the generic implementation is
 *	used IPL_SCHED must be equal to IPL_HIGH.
 *
 *	2) The software interrupts are not preemptive, and so must wait
 *	for the currently executing thread to yield the CPU.  This
 *	can introduce latency.
 *
 *	3) A context switch is required for each soft interrupt to be
 *	handled, which can be quite expensive.
 *
 * 'Fast' software interrupts
 *
 *	XXX
 *
 * The !__HAVE_FAST_SOFTINTS case assumes splhigh == splsched.
