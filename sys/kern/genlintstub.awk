# This awk script is used by kernel Makefiles to construct C lint
# stubs automatically from properly formatted comments in .S files. In
# general, a .S file should have a special comment for anything with
# something like an ENTRY designation. The special formats are:
#
# /* LINTSTUB: Func: type function(args) */
# type must be void, int or long. A return is faked up for ints and longs.
#
# /* LINTSTUB: Var: type variable, variable; */
# This is often appropriate for assembly bits that the rest of the
# kernel has declared as char * and such, like various bits of
# trampoline code.
#
# /* LINTSTUB: include foo */
# Turns into a literal `#include foo' line in the source. Useful for
# making sure the stubs are checked against system prototypes like
# systm.h, cpu.h, etc., and to make sure that various types are
# properly declared.
#
# /* LINTSTUB: Ignore */
# This is used as an indicator to humans (and possible future
# automatic tools) that the entry is only used internally by other .S
# files and does not need a stub. You want this so you know you
# haven't just forgotten to put a stub in for something and you are
# *deliberately* ignoring it.
