# Common files for "make tags".
# Included by the Makefile for each architecture.

# Put the ../sys stuff near the end so that subroutine definitions win when
# there is a struct tag with the same name (eg., vmmeter).  The real
# solution would probably be for ctags to generate "struct vmmeter" tags.

.ifmake tags
# The invocation below returns every directory that contains sources, excluding
# the arch directories. Traditionally, COMM would have been an explicit list.
# This promises to be easier to maintain, considering how often the directory
# structure of the kernel sources has been changing recently.
