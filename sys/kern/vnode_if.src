# Above each of the vop descriptors is a specification of the locking
# protocol used by each vop call.  The first column is the name of
# the variable, the remaining three columns are in, out and error
# respectively.  The "in" column defines the lock state on input,
# the "out" column defines the state on succesful return, and the
# "error" column defines the locking state on error exit.
#     
# The locking value can take the following values:
# L: locked.
# U: unlocked/
# -: not applicable.  vnode does not yet (or no longer) exists.
# =: the same on input and output, may be either L or U.
# X: locked if not nil.
#     
 
#
#% lookup     dvp     L ? ?
#% lookup     vpp     - L -
#
# XXX - the lookup locking protocol defies simple description and depends
#     on the flags and operation fields in the (cnp) structure.  Note
#     especially that *vpp may equal dvp and both may be locked.
#
#    More details:
#     On success, adds a reference to *vpp so it doesn't evaporate.
#     On failure, *vpp is NULL, and *dvp is left locked.
#     If LOCKPARENT is set in cnp, dvp is returned locked even on success.
#     otherwise it is unlocked (unless *vpp == dvp on return)
#	
#     *vpp is always locked on return if the operation succeeds.
#     typically, if *vpp == dvp, you need to release twice, but unlock once.
#
#     If ISDOTDOT is set, dvp is unlocked before *vpp is 
#     locked; dvp is then relocked.  this is done to avoid deadlocking 
#     another process concurrently scanning downwards.
