# Above each of the vop descriptors is a specification of the locking
# protocol used by each vop call.  The first column is the name of
# the variable, the remaining three columns are in, out and error
# respectively.  The "in" column defines the lock state on input,
# the "out" column defines the state on succesful return, and the
# "error" column defines the locking state on error exit.
#     
# The locking value can take the following values:
# L: locked.
# U: unlocked/
# -: not applicable.  vnode does not yet (or no longer) exists.
# =: the same on input and output, may be either L or U.
# X: locked if not nil.
#
# For operations other than VOP_LOOKUP which require a component name
# parameter, the flags required for the initial namei() call are listed.
# Additional flags may be added to the namei() call, but these are required.
#

#% lookup     dvp     L ? ?
#% lookup     vpp     - L -
#
# XXX - the lookup locking protocol defies simple description and depends
#     on the flags and operation fields in the (cnp) structure.  Note
#     especially that *vpp may equal dvp and both may be locked.
#
#    More details:
#     There are three types of lookups: ".", ".." (ISDOTDOT), and other.
#     On successful lookup of ".", a reference is added to dvp, and it
#          is returned in *vpp.
#     To look up ISDOTDOT, dvp is unlocked, the ".." node is locked, and
#          then dvp is relocked iff LOCKPARENT is set and this is the last
#          component name (ISLASTCN set). This preserves the
#          protocol of always locking nodes from root ("/") downward and
#          prevents deadlock.
#     Other lookups find the named node (creating the vnode if needed) and
#          return it, locked, in *vpp.
#     For non-"." lookups, if LOCKPARENT is not set or this was not the
#          last component name, dvp is returned unlocked on a successful
#          lookup.
#     On failure, *vpp is NULL, and *dvp is left locked. If there was
#          an error re-locking dvp (for instance in the ISDOTDOT case),
#          the error is returned with PDIRUNLOCK set.
#	
#     *vpp is always locked on return if the operation succeeds.
#     typically, if *vpp == dvp, you need to release twice, but unlock once.
#
#     The PDIRUNLOCK flag is set when dvp is unlocked in the lookup routine.
#          It signals the caller that dvp's lock state changed. It will
#          be set on exit if either a successful lookup unlocked the
#          parrent, or there was an error re-locking dvp in the ISDOTDOT case.
#
#     See sys/sys/namei.h for a description of the SAVENAME and SAVESTART
#          flags.
