/*
 * Turnsiles are specialized sleep queues for use by locks.  Turnstiles
 * are described in detail in:
 *
 *	Solaris Internals: Core Kernel Architecture, Jim Mauro and
 *	    Richard McDougall.
 *
 * Turnstiles are kept in a hash table.  There are likely to be many more
 * lock objects than there are threads.  Since a thread can block on only
 * one lock at a time, we only need one turnstile per thread, and so they
 * are allocated at thread creation time.
 *
 * When a thread decides it needs to block on a lock, it looks up the
 * active turnstile for that lock.  If no active turnstile exists, then
 * the process lends its turnstile to the lock.  If there is already
 * an active turnstile for the lock, the thread places its turnstile on
 * a list of free turnstiles, and references the active one instead.
 *
 * The act of looking up the turnstile acquires an interlock on the sleep
 * queue.  If a thread decides it doesn't need to block after all, then
 * this interlock must be released by explicitly aborting the turnstile
 * operation.
 *
 * When a thread is awakened, it needs to get its turnstile back.  If
 * there are still other threads waiting in the active turnstile, the
 * the thread grabs a free turnstile off the free list.  Otherwise, it
 * can take back the active turnstile from the lock (thus deactivating
 * the turnstile).
 *
 * Turnstiles are the place to do priority inheritence.  However, we do
 * not currently implement that.
 *
 * We also do not differentiate between the reader and writer queues,
 * although we currently provide for it in the API so that we can add
 * support for it later.
 *
 * XXX We currently have to interlock with the sched_lock.  The locking
 * order is:
 *
 *	turnstile chain -> sched_lock
