/*
 * Overview
 *
 *	Lightweight processes (LWPs) are the basic unit (or thread) of
 *	execution within the kernel.  The core state of an LWP is described
 *	by "struct lwp".
 *
 *	Each LWP is contained within a process (described by "struct proc"),
 *	Every process contains at least one LWP, but may contain more.  The
 *	process describes attributes shared among all of its LWPs such as a
 *	private address space, global execution state (stopped, active,
 *	zombie, ...), signal disposition and so on.  On a multiprocessor
 *	machine, multiple LWPs be executing in kernel simultaneously.
 *
 *	Note that LWPs differ from kernel threads (kthreads) in that kernel
 *	threads are distinct processes (system processes) with no user space
 *	component, which themselves may contain one or more LWPs.
 *
 * Execution states
 *
 *	At any given time, an LWP has overall state that is described by
 *	lwp::l_stat.  The states are broken into two sets below.  The first
 *	set is guaranteed to represent the absolute, current state of the
 *	LWP:
 * 
 * 	LSONPROC
 * 
 * 		On processor: the LWP is executing on a CPU, either in the
 * 		kernel or in user space.
 * 
 * 	LSRUN
 * 
 * 		Runnable: the LWP is parked on a run queue, and may soon be
 * 		chosen to run by a idle processor, or by a processor that
 * 		has been asked to preempt a currently runnning but lower
 * 		priority LWP.  If the LWP is not swapped in (L_INMEM == 0)
 *		then the LWP is not on a run queue, but may be soon.
 * 
 * 	LSIDL
 * 
 * 		Idle: the LWP has been created but has not yet executed. 
 * 		Whoever created the new LWP can be expected to set it to
 * 		another state shortly.
 * 
 * 	LSSUSPENDED:
 * 
 * 		Suspended: the LWP has had its execution suspended by
 *		another LWP in the same process using the _lwp_suspend()
 *		system call.  User-level LWPs also enter the suspended
 *		state when the system is shutting down.
 *
 *	The second set represent a "statement of intent" on behalf of the
 *	LWP.  The LWP may in fact be executing on a processor, may be
 *	sleeping, idle, or on a run queue. It is expected to take the
 *	necessary action to stop executing or become "running" again within
 *	a short timeframe.
 * 
 * 	LSZOMB:
 * 
 * 		Dead: the LWP has released most of its resources and is
 * 		about to switch away into oblivion.  When it switches away,
 * 		its few remaining resources will be collected.
 * 
 * 	LSSLEEP:
 * 
 * 		Sleeping: the LWP has entered itself onto a sleep queue, and
 * 		will switch away shortly to allow other LWPs to run on the
 * 		CPU.
 * 
 * 	LSSTOP:
 * 
 * 		Stopped: the LWP has been stopped as a result of a job
 * 		control signal, or as a result of the ptrace() interface. 
 * 		Stopped LWPs may run briefly within the kernel to handle
 * 		signals that they receive, but will not return to user space
 * 		until their process' state is changed away from stopped. 
 * 		Single LWPs within a process can not be set stopped
 * 		selectively: all actions that can stop or continue LWPs
 * 		occur at the process level.
 * 
 * State transitions
 *
 *	Note that the LSSTOP and LSSUSPENDED states may only be set
 *	when returning to user space in userret(), or when sleeping
 *	interruptably.  Before setting those states, we try to ensure
 *	that the LWPs will release all kernel locks that they hold,
 *	and at a minimum try to ensure that the LWP can be set runnable
 *	again by a signal.
 *
 *	LWPs may transition states in the following ways:
 *
 *	 RUN -------> ONPROC		ONPROC -----> RUN
 *	            > STOPPED			    > SLEEP
 *	            > SUSPENDED			    > STOPPED
 *						    > SUSPENDED
 *						    > ZOMB
 *
 *	 STOPPED ---> RUN		SUSPENDED --> RUN
 *	            > SLEEP			    > SLEEP
 *
 *	 SLEEP -----> ONPROC		IDL --------> RUN
 *		    > RUN		            > SUSPENDED
 *		    > STOPPED                       > STOPPED
 *		    > SUSPENDED
 *
 * Locking
 *
 *	The majority of fields in 'struct lwp' are covered by a single,
 *	general spin mutex pointed to by lwp::l_mutex.  The locks covering
 *	each field are documented in sys/lwp.h.
 *
 *	State transitions must be made with the LWP's general lock held.  In
 *	a multiprocessor kernel, state transitions may cause the LWP's lock
 *	pointer to change.  On uniprocessor kernels, most scheduler and
 *	synchronisation objects such as sleep queues and LWPs are protected
 *	by only one mutex (sched_mutex).  In this case, LWPs' lock pointers
 *	will never change and will always reference sched_mutex.
 *
 *	Manipulation of the general lock is not performed directly, but
 *	through calls to lwp_lock(), lwp_relock() and similar.
 *
 *	States and their associated locks:
 *
 *	LSIDL, LSZOMB
 *
 *		Always covered by sched_mutex.
 *
 *	LSONPROC, LSRUN:
 *
 *		Always covered by sched_mutex, which protects the run queues
 *		and other miscellaneous items.  If the scheduler is changed
 *		to use per-CPU run queues, this may become a per-CPU mutex.
 *
 *	LSSLEEP:
 *
 *		Covered by a mutex associated with the sleep queue that the
 *		LWP resides on, indirectly referenced by l_sleepq->sq_mutex.
 *
 *	LSSTOP, LSSUSPENDED:
 *	
 *		If the LWP was previously sleeping (l_wchan != NULL), then
 *		l_mutex references the sleep queue mutex.  If the LWP was
 *		runnable or on the CPU when halted, or has been removed from
 *		the sleep queue since halted, then the mutex is sched_mutex.
 *
 *	The lock order is as follows:
 *
 *		sleepq_t::sq_mutex -> sched_mutex
 *
 *	Each process has an scheduler state mutex (proc::p_smutex), and a
 *	number of counters on LWPs and their states: p_nzlwps, p_nrlwps, and
 *	so on.  When an LWP is to be entered into or removed from one of the
 *	following states, p_mutex must be held and the process wide counters
 *	adjusted:
 *
 *		LSIDL, LSZOMB, LSSTOP, LSSUSPENDED
 *
 *	Note that an LWP is considered running or likely to run soon if in
 *	one of the following states.  This affects the value of p_nrlwps:
 *
 *		LSRUN, LSONPROC, LSSLEEP
 *
 *	p_smutex does not need to be held when transitioning among these
 *	three states.
