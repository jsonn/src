/*
 * Cross call support
 *
 * Background
 *
 *	Sometimes it is necessary to modify hardware state that is tied
 *	directly to individual CPUs (such as a CPU's local timer), and
 *	these updates can not be done remotely by another CPU.  The LWP
 *	requesting the update may be unable to guarantee that it will be
 *	running on the CPU where the update must occur, when the update
 *	occurs.
 *
 *	Additionally, it's sometimes necessary to modify per-CPU software
 *	state from a remote CPU.  Where these update operations are so
 *	rare or the access to the per-CPU data so frequent that the cost
 *	of using locking or atomic operations to provide coherency is
 *	prohibitive, another way must be found.
 *
 *	Cross calls help to solve these types of problem by allowing
 *	any CPU in the system to request that an arbitrary function be
 *	executed on any other CPU.
 *
 * Implementation
 *
 *	A slow mechanism for making 'low priority' cross calls is
 *	provided.  The function to be executed runs on the remote CPU
 *	within a bound kthread.  No queueing is provided, and the
 *	implementation uses global state.  The function being called may
 *	block briefly on locks, but in doing so must be careful to not
 *	interfere with other cross calls in the system.  The function is
 *	called with thread context and not from a soft interrupt, so it
 *	can ensure that it is not interrupting other code running on the
 *	CPU, and so has exclusive access to the CPU.  Since this facility
 *	is heavyweight, it's expected that it will not be used often.
 *
 *	Cross calls must not allocate memory, as the pagedaemon uses
 *	them (and memory allocation may need to wait on the pagedaemon).
 *
 * Future directions
 *
 *	Add a low-overhead mechanism to run cross calls in interrupt
 *	context (XC_HIGHPRI).
