	$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.1.28.2 2009/01/17 13:29:35 mjf Exp $

* fix the build structure to work better on non-NetBSD
* figure out how to handle mount parameters in fs-independent
  fashion (requires kernel changes)
* integrate build framework with config(1) to stop the need to
  maintain a separate build infrastructure
* find a better solution for rumpdefs.h, the sed "solution"
  doesn't really scale nicely
* improve rump syscalls.  current problems:
  + can only call same process
  + no __RENAME available, so calls might be: rump___sys_socket30()
  + using them requires source level modifications
    - what do to with final &error parameter?  most intrusive change
* make sure no userspace symbols are linked directly against _KERNEL libs
  + current exceptions at least bswap
* add a "proper" scheduler, i.e. map threads to virtual cpu's
  + need to introduce a guard at all entry points into rumpspace
