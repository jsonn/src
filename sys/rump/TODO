* fix the build structure to work better on non-NetBSD
* figure out how to handle mount parameters in fs-independent
  fashion (requires kernel changes)
* integrate build framework with config(1) to stop the need to
  maintain a separate build infrastructure
* make libraries dynamic, dlopen them instead of linking if possible
  + makes a difference for e.g. "fsconsole"
* support nfs (requires using the network stack in userspace)
