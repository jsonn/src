    Runnable Userspace Meta Programs

Quick rundown of the current directory structure:

/librump - kernel runtime emulation
  /rumpkern - portion compiled with -D_KERNEL, uses kernel headers
  /rumpuser - userspace namespace support for previous, *NO* -D_KERNEL
	      provides e.g. malloc() and some syscalls

/include
  /machine - headers meant to be used for rump compilation when the MD
	     ones cause too much trouble, e.g. curlwp which is different
	     from arch to arch

/fs - file system rumps
  /lib - libraries used by fs rumps
    /lib$fs - kernel file system code compiled out of /sys with -D_KERNEL
    /libp2k - puffs-to-vfs adaption layer, userspace namespace
  /bin - rumps themselves.  link to a) librump b) fs library c) libpuffs
