.Sh NAME
.Nm rumpuser
.Nd rump user namespace helper routines
.Sh LIBRARY
rump User Library (librumpuser, \-lrumpuser)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In rump/rumpuser.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a user namespace helper library for runnable userspace meta programs.
From rump emulation code compiled with
.Dv -D_KERNEL
is it not possible to directly call routines such as system calls
for reading and writing files or devices.
This is where
.Nm
comes into play by providing a bridge between the two namespaces.
Another example of its services is a way to call pthread routines,
used for emulating kernel threads and synchronization mechanisms
in rump.
