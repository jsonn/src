/*
 * Unsigned 32-bit division.
 *
 * The SH5 has no native integer divide instruction, which normally doesn't
 * give the compiler a problem as it uses the FPU's divide instruction
 * to fabricate an integer divide.
 *
 * Trouble is, the kernel only saves user FPU state on a context switch and
 * by then there's a fair chance the kernel would have stomped all over it by
 * using floating point instructions itself.
 *
 * The following implementation still uses the FPU's division support, but
 * ensures the affected FP registers are saved and restored before returning.
 *
 * Note: The FP register dirty bits in the USR are not saved/restored as
 * there is a per-process USR stashed in the trapframe on kernel entry which
 * encodes the *real* dirty register state.
 *
 * Note: Division by zero will result in an FPU exception...
 *
 * Note: These don't follow the regular SH-5 ABI calling convention.
 * The dividend is passed in r4 instead of r2, the divisor is passed in
 * r5, and the result is returned in r0. Also, we can only clobber r18-r19, r25.
