 * Here is a very good random number generator.  This implementation is
 * based on ``Two Fast Implementations of the "Minimal Standard" Random
 * Number Generator'', David G. Carta, Communications of the ACM, Jan 1990,
 * Vol 33 No 1.  Do NOT modify this code unless you have a very thorough

 * you do change it, make sure that its 10,000'th invocation returns
 * 1043618065.

 * Here is easier-to-decipher pseudocode:
 *
 * p = (16807*seed)<30:0>	# e.g., the low 31 bits of the product
 * q = (16807*seed)<62:31>	# e.g., the high 31 bits starting at bit 32
 * if (p + q < 2^31)
 * 	seed = p + q
 * else
 *	seed = ((p + q) & (2^31 - 1)) + 1
 * return (seed);
 *
 * The result is in (0,2^31), e.g., it's always positive.
