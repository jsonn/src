Coda is a distributed filesystem.  It is derived from AFS, but
supports disconnected operation, both reading and writing.  This
directory contains the interface between the VFS layer and a
user-space program ("venus") that implements the client part of Coda.
The interface is similar to puffs(9) in many respects.

Coda servers do not need kernel support.

For information on Coda, see
  http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu

As of April 2007, Coda is not quite stable enough for demanding
production use, but is usable by those who are willing to deal with
problems.  Help can be obtained via the list codalist@coda.cs.cmu.edu.

As of April 2007, pkgsrc/net/coda\* is old, and gdt recommends running
code from Coda's CVS.

As of April 2007, the kernel code has not been tested on 64-bit
architectures.  It runs on i386 and has previously been tested on
sparc.
