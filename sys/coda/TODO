1. getcwd

getcwd does not work.

2. VOP_GETPAGES/PUTPAGES

Check behavior vs. specifications.
Resolve uvm_fault layering issue (see PR 28372).

3. check vnops correctness

Check all vnops against their specifications.

4. LK_RETRY removal

Remove the use of LK_RETRY in most or all vn_lock calls.
(Defer this until other filesystems do not call LK_RETRY.)
