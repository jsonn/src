1. coda_lookup locking

coda_lookup does not follow the ISDOTDOT locking rules described in
sys/kern/vnode_if.src.

2. getcwd

getcwd does not work.  (Fixing coda_lookup may fix this.)

3. LK_RETRY removal

Remove the use of LK_RETRY in coda_lookup, and check remaining uses
for correctness.

4. coda_close cleanup

Understand, comment, and clean up '#ifdef hmm' in coda_close.


From 1998 (likely no longer correct):

Near term:
	check cfs_vnodeops.c: re vrele/VOP_LOCK -> vget
		cfs_create, remove, link mkdir, rmdir, symlink

	cfs_vfsops.c: use vfsp vs 0
		cp = makecfsnode(&ctlfid, vfsp, VCHR);

Medium term:
	Add missing VFS methods.
	Do performance profile.
	Tune hash algorithm used in cfs_namecache.

Eventually:
	Use standard queue macros.
