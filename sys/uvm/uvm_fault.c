 *
 * d/c = don't care
 * 
 *   case [0]: layerless fault
 *	no amap or uobj is present.   this is an error.
 *
 *   case [1]: upper layer fault [anon active]
 *     1A: [read] or [write with anon->an_ref == 1]
 *		I/O takes place in top level anon and uobj is not touched.
 *     1B: [write with anon->an_ref > 1]
 *		new anon is alloc'd and data is copied off ["COW"]
 *
 *   case [2]: lower layer fault [uobj]
 *     2A: [read on non-NULL uobj] or [write to non-copy_on_write area]
 *		I/O takes place directly in object.
 *     2B: [write to copy_on_write] or [read on NULL uobj]
 *		data is "promoted" from uobj to a new anon.   
 *		if uobj is null, then we zero fill.
 *
 * we follow the standard UVM locking protocol ordering:
 *
 * MAPS => AMAP => UOBJ => ANON => PAGE QUEUES (PQ) 
 * we hold a PG_BUSY page if we unlock for I/O
 *
 *
 * the code is structured as follows:
 *  
 *     - init the "IN" params in the ufi structure
 *   ReFault:
 *     - do lookups [locks maps], check protection, handle needs_copy
 *     - check for case 0 fault (error)
 *     - establish "range" of fault
 *     - if we have an amap lock it and extract the anons
 *     - if sequential advice deactivate pages behind us
 *     - at the same time check pmap for unmapped areas and anon for pages
 *	 that we could map in (and do map it if found)
 *     - check object for resident pages that we could map in
 *     - if (case 2) goto Case2
 *     - >>> handle case 1
 *           - ensure source anon is resident in RAM
 *           - if case 1B alloc new anon and copy from source
 *           - map the correct page in
 *   Case2:
 *     - >>> handle case 2
 *           - ensure source page is resident (if uobj)
 *           - if case 2B alloc new anon and copy from source (could be zero
 *		fill if uobj == NULL)
 *           - map the correct page in
 *     - done!
 *
 * note on paging:
 *   if we have to do I/O we place a PG_BUSY page in the correct object,
 * unlock everything, and do the I/O.   when I/O is done we must reverify
 * the state of the world before assuming that our data structures are
 * valid.   [because mappings could change while the map is unlocked]
 *
 *  alternative 1: unbusy the page in question and restart the page fault
 *    from the top (ReFault).   this is easy but does not take advantage
 *    of the information that we already have from our previous lookup, 
 *    although it is possible that the "hints" in the vm_map will help here.
 *
 * alternative 2: the system already keeps track of a "version" number of
 *    a map.   [i.e. every time you write-lock a map (e.g. to change a
 *    mapping) you bump the version number up by one...]   so, we can save
 *    the version number of the map before we release the lock and start I/O.
 *    then when I/O is done we can relock and check the version numbers
 *    to see if anything changed.    this might save us some over 1 because
 *    we don't have to unbusy the page and may be less compares(?).
 *
 * alternative 3: put in backpointers or a way to "hold" part of a map
 *    in place while I/O is in progress.   this could be complex to
 *    implement (especially with structures like amap that can be referenced
 *    by multiple map entries, and figuring out what should wait could be
 *    complex as well...).
 *
 * given that we are not currently multiprocessor or multithreaded we might
 * as well choose alternative 2 now.   maybe alternative 3 would be useful
 * in the future.    XXX keep in mind for future consideration//rechecking.
