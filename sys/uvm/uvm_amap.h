/*
 * defines for handling of large sparce amaps.
 *
 * currently the kernel likes to allocate large chunks of VM to reserve
 * them for possible use.   for example, it allocates (reserves) a large 
 * chunk of user VM for possible stack growth.   most of the time only 
 * a page or two of this VM is actually used.   since the stack is anonymous
 * memory it makes sense for it to live in an amap, but if we allocated
 * an amap for the entire stack range we could end up wasting a large 
 * amount of malloc'd KVM.   
 * 
 * for example, on the i386 at boot time we allocate two amaps for the stack 
 * of /sbin/init: 
 *  1. a 7680 slot amap at protection 0 (reserve space for stack)
 *  2. a 512 slot amap at protection 7 (top of stack)
 *
 * most of that VM is never mapped or used.   
 *
 * to avoid allocating amap resources for the whole range we have the
 * VM system look for maps that are larger than UVM_AMAP_LARGE slots
 * (note that 1 slot = 1 vm_page).   for maps that are large, we attempt
 * to break them up into UVM_AMAP_CHUNK slot sized amaps.
 *
 * so, in the i386 example, the 7680 slot area is never referenced so
 * nothing gets allocated.   the 512 slot area is referenced, and it
 * gets divided into 16 slot chunks (hopefully with one 16 slot chunk
 * being enough to handle the whole stack...).
