/*
 * uvm_km.c: handle kernel memory allocation and management
 */

/*
 * overview of kernel memory management:
 *
 * the kernel virtual address space is mapped by "kernel_map."   kernel_map
 * starts at VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS and goes to VM_MAX_KERNEL_ADDRESS.
 * note that VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS is equal to vm_map_min(kernel_map).
 *
 * the kernel_map has several "submaps."   submaps can only appear in 
 * the kernel_map (user processes can't use them).   submaps "take over"
 * the management of a sub-range of the kernel's address space.  submaps
 * are typically allocated at boot time and are never released.   kernel
 * virtual address space that is mapped by a submap is locked by the 
 * submap's lock -- not the kernel_map's lock.
 *
 * thus, the useful feature of submaps is that they allow us to break
 * up the locking and protection of the kernel address space into smaller
 * chunks.
 *
 * the vm system has several standard kernel submaps, including:
 *   kmem_map => contains only wired kernel memory for the kernel
 *		malloc.   *** access to kmem_map must be protected
 *		by splimp() because we are allowed to call malloc()
 *		at interrupt time ***
 *   mb_map => memory for large mbufs,  *** protected by splimp ***
 *   pager_map => used to map "buf" structures into kernel space
 *   exec_map => used during exec to handle exec args
 *   etc...
 *
 * the kernel allocates its private memory out of special uvm_objects whose
 * reference count is set to UVM_OBJ_KERN (thus indicating that the objects
 * are "special" and never die).   all kernel objects should be thought of
 * as large, fixed-sized, sparsely populated uvm_objects.   each kernel 
 * object is equal to the size of kernel virtual address space (i.e. the
 * value "VM_MAX_KERNEL_ADDRESS - VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS").
 *
 * most kernel private memory lives in kernel_object.   the only exception
 * to this is for memory that belongs to submaps that must be protected
 * by splimp().    each of these submaps has their own private kernel 
 * object (e.g. kmem_object, mb_object).
 *
 * note that just because a kernel object spans the entire kernel virutal
 * address space doesn't mean that it has to be mapped into the entire space.
 * large chunks of a kernel object's space go unused either because 
 * that area of kernel VM is unmapped, or there is some other type of 
 * object mapped into that range (e.g. a vnode).    for submap's kernel
 * objects, the only part of the object that can ever be populated is the
 * offsets that are managed by the submap.
 *
 * note that the "offset" in a kernel object is always the kernel virtual
 * address minus the VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS (aka vm_map_min(kernel_map)).
 * example:
 *   suppose VM_MIN_KERNEL_ADDRESS is 0xf8000000 and the kernel does a
 *   uvm_km_alloc(kernel_map, PAGE_SIZE) [allocate 1 wired down page in the
 *   kernel map].    if uvm_km_alloc returns virtual address 0xf8235000,
 *   then that means that the page at offset 0x235000 in kernel_object is
 *   mapped at 0xf8235000.   
 *
 * note that the offsets in kmem_object and mb_object also follow this
 * rule.   this means that the offsets for kmem_object must fall in the
 * range of [vm_map_min(kmem_object) - vm_map_min(kernel_map)] to
 * [vm_map_max(kmem_object) - vm_map_min(kernel_map)], so the offsets
 * in those objects will typically not start at zero.
 *
 * kernel object have one other special property: when the kernel virtual
 * memory mapping them is unmapped, the backing memory in the object is
 * freed right away.   this is done with the uvm_km_pgremove() function.
 * this has to be done because there is no backing store for kernel pages
 * and no need to save them after they are no longer referenced.
