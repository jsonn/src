/*
 * This is the pc filesystem specific portion of the vnode structure.
 *
 * To describe a file uniquely the de_dirclust, de_diroffset, and
 * de_StartCluster fields are used.
 *
 * de_dirclust contains the cluster number of the directory cluster
 *	containing the entry for a file or directory.
 * de_diroffset is the index into the cluster for the entry describing
 *	a file or directory.
 * de_StartCluster is the number of the first cluster of the file or directory.
 *
 * Now to describe the quirks of the pc filesystem.
 * - Clusters 0 and 1 are reserved.
 * - The first allocatable cluster is 2.
 * - The root directory is of fixed size and all blocks that make it up
 *   are contiguous.
 * - Cluster 0 refers to the root directory when it is found in the
 *   startcluster field of a directory entry that points to another directory.
 * - Cluster 0 implies a 0 length file when found in the start cluster field
 *   of a directory entry that points to a file.
 * - You can't use the cluster number 0 to derive the address of the root
 *   directory.
 * - Multiple directory entries can point to a directory. The entry in the
 *   parent directory points to a child directory.  Any directories in the
 *   child directory contain a ".." entry that points back to the parent.
 *   The child directory itself contains a "." entry that points to itself.
 * - The root directory does not contain a "." or ".." entry.
 * - Directory entries for directories are never changed once they are created
 *   (except when removed).  The size stays 0, and the last modification time
 *   is never changed.  This is because so many directory entries can point to
 *   the physical clusters that make up a directory.  It would lead to an
 *   update nightmare.
 * - The length field in a directory entry pointing to a directory contains 0
 *   (always).  The only way to find the end of a directory is to follow the
 *   cluster chain until the "last cluster" marker is found.
 *
 * My extensions to make this house of cards work.  These apply only to the in
 * memory copy of the directory entry.
 * - A reference count for each denode will be kept since dos doesn't keep such
 *   things.
