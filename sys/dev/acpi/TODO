Important things to make ACPI useful on more machines:

* Fix problems with ACPI_PCI_FIXUP.  CardBus slots do not work in some
  machines currently.  (Affects many machines.)

* Import the ACPI Processor driver from FreeBSD or write our own.
  This is useful for CPUs that supports _Px and _Cx states and helps
  longer battery life.
