Important things to make ACPI useful on more machines:

* Fix problems with PCI_INTR_FIXUP.  The current code always chooses the last
  possible interrupt, which causes problems when that interrupt is shared with
  an ISA device.  http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2005/11/11/0011.html
  has a more detailed analysis.

* Import the ACPI Processor driver from FreeBSD or write our own.
  This is useful for CPUs that supports _Px and _Cx states and helps
  longer battery life.
