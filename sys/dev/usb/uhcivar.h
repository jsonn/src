/*
 * To avoid having 1024 TDs for each isochronous transfer we introduce
 * a virtual frame list.  Every UHCI_VFRAMELIST_COUNT entries in the real
 * frame list points to a non-active TD.  These, in turn, which form the 
 * starts of the virtual frame list.  This also has the advantage that it 
 * simplifies linking in/out TD/QH in the schedule.
 * Furthermore, initially each of the inactive TDs point to an inactive
 * QH that forms the start of the interrupt traffic for that slot.
 * Each of these QHs point to the same QH that is the start of control
 * traffic.
 *
 * UHCI_VFRAMELIST_COUNT should be a power of 2 and <= UHCI_FRAMELIST_COUNT.
