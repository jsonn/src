# $NetBSD: TODO,v 1.5.2.5 2001/04/21 17:48:50 bouyer Exp $

Bugs:
* i386: detect the existence of MCA bus by BIOS call
* i386: make isa/clock.c parse PS/2 CMOS correctly
* i386: keyboard freezes in fd_mountroothook when booting from floppy;
	if the fd_mountroothook is not executed, the keyboard works
	just fine
	maybe rev.1.6 of sys/dev/ic/pckbc.c fixes this?

Projects:
* proper MCA DMA/bus_dma(9) support (primarily for AHA-1640 ATM), using
  code from dasd_mca.c:dasd_setup_dma()
