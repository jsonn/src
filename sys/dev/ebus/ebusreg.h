/*
 * SPARC `ebus'
 *
 * The `ebus' bus is designed to plug traditional PC-ISA devices into
 * an SPARC system with as few costs as possible, without sacrificing
 * to performance.  Typically, it is implemented in the PCIO IC from
 * SME, which also implements a `hme-compatible' PCI network device
 * (`network').  The ebus has 4 DMA channels, similar to the DMA seen
 * in the ESP SCSI DMA.
 *
 * Typical UltraSPARC systems have a NatSemi SuperIO IC to provide
 * serial ports for the keyboard and mouse (`se'), floppy disk
 * controller (`fdthree'), parallel port controller (`bpp') connected
 * to the ebus, and a PCI-IDE controller (connected directly to the
 * PCI bus, of course), as well as a Siemens Nixdorf SAB82532 dual
 * channel serial controller (`su' providing ttya and ttyb), an MK48T59
 * EEPROM/clock controller (also where the idprom, including the
 * ethernet address, is located), the audio system (`SUNW,CS4231', same
 * as other UltraSPARC and some SPARC systems), and other various
 * internal devices found on traditional SPARC systems such as the
 * `power', `flashprom', etc., devices.  Other machines with this
 * device include the JavaStation10.
 *
 * The ebus uses an interrupt mapping scheme similar to PCI, though
 * the actual structures are different.
