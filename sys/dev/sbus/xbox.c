/*
 * Xbox registers definitions.
 *
 * The xbox device can operate in two mode: "opaque" and "transparent".
 * In opaque mode, all accesses to the xbox address space are directed
 * to the xbox itself. In transparent mode, all accesses are mapped to
 * the SBus cards in the expansion box.
 *
 * To access the xbox registers in transparent mode, you must write
 * to the "write0" register. The layout of this register appears to
 * be as follows:
 *
 *	bit 31-24: xbox key (identifies device when you cascade them)
 *	bit 23-12: offset of register to access
 *	bit 11-0:  value to write
 *
 * For instance, to switch to opaque mode:
 *	(*sc->write0_reg) = (sc->sc_key << 24) | XAC_CTL1_OFFSET;
 *
 * (note we're not currently using any of this)
