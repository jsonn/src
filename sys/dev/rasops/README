This directory contains 'rasops', a set of raster operations intended to
replace the dev/rcons/raster stuff for both wscons and rcons. It yields
significantly improved performance, supports multiple depths and color.

TODO	o There is no generic `putchar' function for 2bpp.
	o Color handling for 2bpp is broken.
	o copycols() from rasops_bitops.h is broken in right->left case.
	o The stamp mutex is not particularly safe.
	o rasops_pmask[][] is too big (4kB).
	o 64-bit types are not used on machines that are 64-bit.
	o We should never be doing reads/writes of less than 32-bits.
