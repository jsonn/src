 * Definitions for the Dallas Semiconductor DS1286/DS1386 Real Time Clock.
 *
 * Plucked right from the Dallas Semicomductor specs available at
 * http://www.dalsemi.com/datasheets/pdfs/1286.pdf and 
 * http://www.dalsemi.com/datasheets/pdfs/1386p.pdf
 *
 * The DS1286 and 1386 have 14 clock-related registers and some amount
 * of user registers (50 for the 1286, 8K or 32K for the 1386).  The
 * first eleven registers contain time-of-day and alarm data, the rest
 * contain various control bits and the watchdog timer functionality.
 *
 * Since the locations of these ports and the method used to access 
 * them can be machine-dependent, the low-level details of reading 
 * and writing the RTC's registers are handled by machine-specific 
 * functions.
 *
 * The Dalla chip always stored time-of-day and alarm data in BCD.
 * The "hour" time-of-year and alarm fields can either be expressed in
 * AM/PM format, or in 24-hour format.  If AM/PM format is chosen, the
 * hour fields can have the values: 1-12 and 21-32 (the latter being
 * PM).  If the 24-hour format is chosen, they can have the values
 * 0-23.  The hour format is selectable separately for the time and
 * alarm fields, and is controller by bit 6 of the respective register.
