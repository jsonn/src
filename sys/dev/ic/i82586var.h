/*
 * Ethernet status, per interface.
 *
 * hardware addresses/sizes to know (all KVA):
 *   sc_iobase = base of chip's 24 bit address space
 *   sc_maddr  = base address of chip RAM as stored in ie_base of iscp
 *   sc_msize  = size of chip's RAM
 *   sc_reg    = address of card dependent registers
 *
 * the chip uses two types of pointers: 16 bit and 24 bit
 *   16 bit pointers are offsets from sc_maddr/ie_base
 *      KVA(16 bit offset) = offset + sc_maddr
 *   24 bit pointers are offset from sc_iobase in KVA
 *      KVA(24 bit address) = address + sc_iobase
 *
 * on the vme/multibus we have the page map to control where ram appears
 * in the address space.   we choose to have RAM start at 0 in the
 * 24 bit address space.   this means that sc_iobase == sc_maddr!
 * to get the phyiscal address of the board's RAM you must take the
 * top 12 bits of the physical address of the register address
 * and or in the 4 bits from the status word as bits 17-20 (remember that
 * the board ignores the chip's top 4 address lines).
 * For example:
 *   if the register is @ 0xffe88000, then the top 12 bits are 0xffe00000.
 *   to get the 4 bits from the the status word just do status & IEVME_HADDR.
 *   suppose the value is "4".   Then just shift it left 16 bits to get
 *   it into bits 17-20 (e.g. 0x40000).    Then or it to get the
 *   address of RAM (in our example: 0xffe40000).   see the attach routine!
 *
 * on the onboard ie interface the 24 bit address space is hardwired
 * to be 0xff000000 -> 0xffffffff of KVA.   this means that sc_iobase
 * will be 0xff000000.   sc_maddr will be where ever we allocate RAM
 * in KVA.    note that since the SCP is at a fixed address it means
 * that we have to allocate a fixed KVA for the SCP.
