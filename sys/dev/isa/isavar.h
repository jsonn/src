/*
 * ISA interrupt handler manipulation.
 * 
 * To establish an ISA interrupt handler, a driver calls isa_intr_establish()
 * with the interrupt number, type, level, function, and function argument of
 * the interrupt it wants to handle.  Isa_intr_establish() returns an opaque
 * handle to an event descriptor if it succeeds, and returns NULL on failure.
 * (XXX: some drivers can't handle this, since the former behaviour was to
 * invoke panic() on failure). When the system does not accept any of the
 * interrupt types supported by the driver, the driver should fail the attach.
 * Interrupt handlers should return 0 for "interrupt not for me", 1  for
 * "I took care of it", or -1 for "I guess it was mine, but I wasn't
 * expecting it."
 *
 * To remove an interrupt handler, the driver calls isa_intr_disestablish() 
 * with the handle returned by isa_intr_establish() for that handler.
 *
 * The event counter (struct evcnt) associated with an interrupt line
 * (to be used as 'parent' for an ISA device's interrupt handler's evcnt)
 * can be obtained with isa_intr_evcnt().
