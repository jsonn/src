/*
 * wsfont_find() can be called with any of the parameters as 0, meaning we
 * don't care about that aspect of the font. It returns a cookie which
 * we can use with the other functions. When more flexibility is required,
 * wsfont_enum() should be used. The last two parameters to wsfont_lock()
 * are the bit order and byte order required (WSFONT_L2R or WSFONT_R2L).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *	struct wsdisplay_font *font;
 *	int cookie;
 *
 *	if ((cookie = wsfont_find(NULL, 8, 16, 0, 0)) <= 0)
 *		panic("unable to get 8x16 font");
 *
 *	if (wsfont_lock(cookie, &font, WSFONT_L2R, WSFONT_R2L) <= 0)
 *		panic("unable to lock font");
 *
 *	... do stuff ...
 *
 *	wsfont_unlock(cookie);
