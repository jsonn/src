/*********************************************************************************
 * rf_memchunk.c
 *
 * experimental code.  I've found that the malloc and free calls in the DAG
 * creation code are very expensive.  Since for any given workload the DAGs
 * created for different accesses are likely to be similar to each other, the
 * amount of memory used for any given DAG data structure is likely to be one
 * of a small number of values.  For example, in UNIX, all reads and writes will
 * be less than 8k and will not span stripe unit boundaries.  Thus in the absence
 * of failure, the only DAGs that will ever get created are single-node reads
 * and single-stripe-unit atomic read-modify-writes.  So, I'm very likely to
 * be continually asking for chunks of memory equal to the sizes of these two
 * DAGs.
 *
 * This leads to the idea of holding on to these chunks of memory when the DAG is
 * freed and then, when a new DAG is created, trying to find such a chunk before
 * calling malloc.
 *
 * the "chunk list" is a list of lists.  Each header node contains a size value
 * and a pointer to a list of chunk descriptors, each of which holds a pointer
 * to a chunk of memory of the indicated size.
 *
 * There is currently no way to purge memory out of the chunk list.  My
 * initial thought on this is to have a low-priority thread that wakes up every
 * 1 or 2 seconds, purges all the chunks with low reuse counts, and sets all
 * the reuse counts to zero.
 *
 * This whole idea may be bad, since malloc may be able to do this more efficiently.
 * It's worth a try, though, and it can be turned off by setting useMemChunks to 0.
