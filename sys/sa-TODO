Things to do for scheduler activations/LWP code.

- Document! Not everyone wants to read the thesis. Man pages, etc.

- Rethink scheduler. Verify that behavior is still correct for a system
  of single-LWP ("traditional") processes (I believe it is, but it should 
  still be verified). Study scheduling behavior of multi-LWP and SA processes.
  Notions of fairness and appropriate scheduling may need changing.
  XXX when combined with multiprocessor support, usefully scheduling multi-lwp
  processes requires a whole new kind of scheduling. Implementing such a thing
  (such as an "equal-space" scheduler) is a major project unto itself.

- lwp-exit2: kill -9 should succeed against processes whose LWPs are
  all suspended.

- sa_yield() should put the yielding LWP into the cache, not exiting.
  Requires a certain amount of chumminess with the reaper.

- Adapt /proc and libkvm interfaces to support examining LWP/SA data
  structures. Adapt ps and friends to display such.

- Implement better management of the lwp cache for a sa process. High-water 
  mark needed, at the very least.

- exit1() is too fragile. A cleaner solution to the LWPWAIT_EXITCONTROL
  problem is also needed.

- Debugging interface needs work; ptrace(2) interface can't handle multi-LWP
  or SA processes. 

- Of course, check all new XXX'd parts.
