/*
 * DVMA (Direct Virtual Memory Access - like DMA)
 *
 * In the Sun3 architecture, memory cycles initiated by secondary bus
 * masters (DVMA devices) passed through the same MMU that governed CPU
 * accesses.  All DVMA devices were wired in such a way so that an offset
 * was added to the addresses they issued, causing them to access virtual
 * memory starting at address 0x0FF00000 - the offset.  The task of
 * enabling a DVMA device to access main memory only involved creating
 * valid mapping in the MMU that translated these high addresses into the
 * appropriate physical addresses.
 *
 * The Sun3x presents a challenge to programming DVMA because the MMU is no
 * longer shared by both secondary bus masters and the CPU.  The MC68030's
 * built-in MMU serves only to manage virtual memory accesses initiated by
 * the CPU.  Secondary bus master bus accesses pass through a different MMU,
 * aptly named the 'I/O Mapper'.  To enable every device driver that uses
 * DVMA to understand that these two address spaces are disconnected would
 * require a tremendous amount of code re-writing. To avoid this, we will
 * ensure that the I/O Mapper and the MC68030 MMU are programmed together,
 * so that DVMA mappings are consistent in both the CPU virtual address
 * space and secondary bus master address space - creating an environment
 * just like the Sun3 system.
 *
 * The maximum address space that any DVMA device in the Sun3x architecture
 * is capable of addressing is 24 bits wide (16 Megabytes.)  We can alias
 * all of the mappings that exist in the I/O mapper by duplicating them in
 * a specially reserved section of the CPU's virtual address space, 16
 * Megabytes in size.  Whenever a DVMA buffer is allocated, the allocation
 * code will enter in a mapping both in the MC68030 MMU page tables and the
 * I/O mapper.
 *
 * The address returned by the allocation routine is a virtual address that
 * the requesting driver must use to access the buffer.  It is up to the
 * device driver to convert this virtual address into the appropriate slave
 * address that its device should issue to access the buffer.  (The will be
 * routines that will assist the driver in doing so.)
 *
 * XXX - This needs work.  The address from dvma_malloc() faults!
