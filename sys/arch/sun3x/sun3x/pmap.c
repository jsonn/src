/*
 * XXX These comments aren't quite accurate.  Need to change.
 * The sun3x uses the MC68851 Memory Management Unit, which is built
 * into the CPU.  The 68851 maps virtual to physical addresses using
 * a multi-level table lookup, which is stored in the very memory that
 * it maps.  The number of levels of lookup is configurable from one
 * to four.  In this implementation, we use three, named 'A' through 'C'.
 *
 * The MMU translates virtual addresses into physical addresses by 
 * traversing these tables in a proccess called a 'table walk'.  The most 
 * significant 7 bits of the Virtual Address ('VA') being translated are 
 * used as an index into the level A table, whose base in physical memory 
 * is stored in a special MMU register, the 'CPU Root Pointer' or CRP.  The 
 * address found at that index in the A table is used as the base
 * address for the next table, the B table.  The next six bits of the VA are 
 * used as an index into the B table, which in turn gives the base address 
 * of the third and final C table.
 *
 * The next six bits of the VA are used as an index into the C table to
 * locate a Page Table Entry (PTE).  The PTE is a physical address in memory
 * to which the remaining 13 bits of the VA are added, producing the
 * mapped physical address.
 *
 * To map the entire memory space in this manner would require 2114296 bytes 
 * of page tables per process - quite expensive.  Instead we will 
 * allocate a fixed but considerably smaller space for the page tables at 
 * the time the VM system is initialized.  When the pmap code is asked by
 * the kernel to map a VA to a PA, it allocates tables as needed from this
 * pool.  When there are no more tables in the pool, tables are stolen
 * from the oldest mapped entries in the tree.  This is only possible 
 * because all memory mappings are stored in the kernel memory map
 * structures, independent of the pmap structures.  A VA which references
 * one of these invalidated maps will cause a page fault.  The kernel
 * will determine that the page fault was caused by a task using a valid 
 * VA, but for some reason (which does not concern it), that address was
 * not mapped.  It will ask the pmap code to re-map the entry and then
 * it will resume executing the faulting task.
 *
 * In this manner the most efficient use of the page table space is
 * achieved.  Tasks which do not execute often will have their tables 
 * stolen and reused by tasks which execute more frequently.  The best
 * size for the page table pool will probably be determined by 
 * experimentation.
 *
 * You read all of the comments so far.  Good for you.
 * Now go play!
 */

/*** A Note About the 68851 Address Translation Cache
 * The MC68851 has a 64 entry cache, called the Address Translation Cache
 * or 'ATC'.  This cache stores the most recently used page descriptors
 * accessed by the MMU when it does translations.  Using a marker called a
 * 'task alias' the MMU can store the descriptors from 8 different table
 * spaces concurrently.  The task alias is associated with the base
 * address of the level A table of that address space.  When an address
 * space is currently active (the CRP currently points to its A table)
 * the only cached descriptors that will be obeyed are ones which have a
 * matching task alias of the current space associated with them.
 *
 * Since the cache is always consulted before any table lookups are done,
 * it is important that it accurately reflect the state of the MMU tables.
 * Whenever a change has been made to a table that has been loaded into
 * the MMU, the code must be sure to flush any cached entries that are
 * affected by the change.  These instances are documented in the code at
 * various points.
 */
/*** A Note About the Note About the 68851 Address Translation Cache
 * 4 months into this code I discovered that the sun3x does not have
 * a MC68851 chip. Instead, it has a version of this MMU that is part of the
 * the 68030 CPU.
 * All though it behaves very similarly to the 68851, it only has 1 task
 * alias and a 22 entry cache.  So sadly (or happily), the first paragraph
 * of the previous note does not apply to the sun3x pmap.
