# XXX AU1500 PCI seems busted, at least on the DBAU1500.  Attempts to use
# commands like "dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/f bs=64k count=1000" result in
# kernel panics when running diskless with / mounted over a PCI NIC.
#
# Additionally early steppings (AB, AC) of the AU1500 are incredibly buggy
# and are unlikely to perform properly without special software workarounds
# that I have not yet figured out.
#
# Finally, the AU1500 pci bus is completely hopeless when it comes to making
# PCI-PCI bridges (such as multiport ethernet cards).  The design is flawed,
# and has not been fixed in at least the AD stepping of the AU1500.
#
# I would welcome some constructive feedback or correction to any or all of
# these problems.  Please include gdamore@netbsd.org if you figure this out.
