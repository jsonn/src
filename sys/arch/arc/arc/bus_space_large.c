/*
 * For large sparse bus space
 * (e.g. NEC RISCstation 2250 PCI memory space: 432MB)
 *
 * This bus_space uses either wired TLB or normal KSEG2 mapping
 * for each bus space region.
 *
 * Wired TLB will be used on the following cases:
 * - If requested region is already mapped by wired TLBs.
 *	This is needed for some critical resources which are used
 *	on kernel early stage (e.g. console device resources)
 * - If requested region size >= ARC_THRESHOLD_TO_USE_WIRED_TLB,
 *   and enough wired TLBs are still free.
 *	In this case, the size of wired TLBs becomes always
 *	ARC_WIRED_PAGE_SIZE (i.e. 16MB). (See wired_map.c for detail.)
