NetBSD/mvme68k port README for NetBSD 1.1

supported environment:

	Motorola makes a number of m68k VME cards.  This port
currently only works on the m68030 based VME147 card (diskless only
for now).

requirements:
	- VME147 card
	- a machine to connect the console to
	- network connection
	- NFS server (to serve root and swap)

future plans:
	- VME147 scsi disk support
	- hopefully, support for the VME162 card


how to boot:
	Booting NetBSD/mvme68k on a VME147 is somewhat painful because
the ROM doesn't know how to talk to the ethernet chip.   I have solved
this problem by downloading a bootstrap into RAM via the console line.

	First, you will need a mvme68k NFS mountable /usr and root
directory.  Version 1.1 of NetBSD/mvme68k consists of the following files:
	export_exec_mvme68k.tar.gz: /export/exec/mvme68k files (mount on /usr)
	export_root_mvme68k.tar.gz: /export/root/mvme68k files (mount on /)
	domestic_mvme68k.tar.gz: domestic crypto stuff (restricted to US)
	README: this file

These files can be ftp'd from ftp.netbsd.org in mvme68k area of the 1.1
distribution.

	First extract the files in the proper place on your NFS server.   
Then get the following files: /export/exec/mvme68k/mdec/netboot and 
/export/exec/mvme68k/mdec/sboot.  Copy netboot to /tftpboot/boot.mvme68k of
your NFS server machine.  Make a symbolic link from the hex encoding of your 
IP address to that file.  For example:

lrwxrwxrwx  1 root     11 Apr 13 17:27 80FCA93F.147 -> boot.mvme68k


[80FCA93F is the IP address (128.252.169.63) of my vme147.]

Make sure you've got the right info in /etc/ethers and /etc/bootparams 
on your server.


Now, bring up your 147.  You should have the "bug" prompt:

COLD Start

Onboard  RAM start = $00000000,  stop = $007FFFFF

147-Bug>


Make sure the "stop" looks ok (if you've got 8MB you should have the
same value as I).  Also make sure the clock is ticking:

147-Bug>time
Sunday   5/30/27   16:25:14
147-Bug>time
Sunday   5/30/27   16:25:15
147-Bug>


Looks good.  you now need to download "sboot" into RAM.  you can
either do that through the console line or through a 2nd serial
connection.  I have my 147 connected to a sun4/110 and I access it via
"tip".  to load that way do this:

lo 0
~Ccat sboot
go 4000

which will look like this:
147-Bug>
147-Bug>lo 0
~CLocal command? cat sboot

away for 11 seconds 
!

147-Bug>g 4000
Effective address: 00004000 

sboot: serial line bootstrap program (&end = 5fd8)

>>> 


Now, if you want to do it through serial line 1, then connect serial
line one to a machine.  At the "147-Bug> " prompt do this "tm
1"... you should then login to what ever machine it is connected to.
Then hit "^A" to escape to Bug.  do "lo 1;x=cat sboot" ... then when
that is done you can reconnect "tm 1" and logout.  Then do "go 4000"
and you've got ">>> " prompt of sboot.


Once you've got the ">>> " prompt you can do commands such as:
"b"		- boot "netbsd" multiuser
"b gennetbsd"	- boot "gennetbsd" multiuser
"b -s"		- boot "netbsd" single user
"b gennetbsd -s"- boot "gennetbsd" single user

A typical boot looks like this:

sboot: serial line bootstrap program (&end = 5fc8)

>>> b

My ip address is: 128.252.169.63
