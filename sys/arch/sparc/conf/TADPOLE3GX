#options 	INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE	# embed config file in kernel binary

maxusers	32

## System kernel configuration.  See options(4) for more detail.


# Options for variants of the Sun SPARC architecure.
# We currently support three architecture types; at least one is required.
options 	SUN4M		# sun4m - SS10, SS20, Classic, etc.

## System options specific to the sparc machine type

# Blink the power LED on some machines to indicate the system load.
#options 	BLINK

## Use a faster console than the PROM's slow drawing routines.  Not needed
## for headless (no framebuffer) machines.
options 	RASTERCONSOLE		# fast rasterop console
#options 	FONT_GALLANT12x22	# the console font
options 	FONT_BOLD8x16		# a somewhat smaller font
options 	RASTERCONSOLE_FGCOL=WSCOL_BLACK
options 	RASTERCONSOLE_BGCOL=WSCOL_WHITE

#### System options that are the same for all ports

## Root device configuration: change the ?'s if you are going to use a
## nonstandard root partition (other than where the kernel is booted from)
## and/or nonstandard root type (not ffs or nfs).  Normally this can be
## automagically determined at boot time.

config		netbsd	root on ? type ?

## System call tracing (see ktrace(1)).
options 	KTRACE

## Collect statistics on kernel malloc's and free's.  This does have a
## significant performance hit on slower machines, so it is intended for
## diagnostic use only.
#options 	KMEMSTATS

## System V compatible IPC subsystem.  (msgctl(2), semctl(2), and shmctl(2))
options 	SYSVMSG		# System V message queues
options 	SYSVSEM		# System V semaphores
options 	SYSVSHM		# System V shared memory
#options 	SHMMAXPGS=1024	# 1024 pages is the default

## Loadable kernel module support; still under development.
options 	LKM

options 	USERCONF	# userconf(4) support
#options	PIPE_SOCKETPAIR	# smaller, but slower pipe(2)
#options 	SYSCTL_INCLUDE_DESCR	# Include sysctl descriptions in kernel

## NFS boot options; tries DHCP/BOOTP then BOOTPARAM
options 	NFS_BOOT_BOOTPARAM
#options 	NFS_BOOT_BOOTP
options 	NFS_BOOT_DHCP

#### Debugging options

## The DDB in-kernel debugger runs at panic (unless DDB_ONPANIC=0), or at
## serial console break or keyboard reset, where the PROM would normally
## intercept.  DDB_HISTORY_SIZE adds up/down arrow command history.
#options 	DDB			# kernel dynamic debugger
#options 	DDB_HISTORY_SIZE=100	# enable history editing in DDB
#options 	DDB_ONPANIC=1		# see also sysctl(8): `ddb.onpanic'

## You may also use gdb, on another computer connected to this machine over
## a serial port.  Both KGDB_DEV and KGDB_DEVRATE should be specified;
## KGDB_DEV is a dev_t encoded device number of the serial port to use.
## (0xc01 = ttya, 0xc02 = ttyb.)
#options 	KGDB			# support for kernel gdb
#options 	KGDB_DEV=0xc01		# kgdb device number (this is `ttyb')
#options 	KGDB_DEVRATE=38400	# baud rate


## Compile the kernel with debugging symbols (`netbsd.gdb' is the debug file),
## such that gdb(1) can be used on a kernel coredump.

makeoptions	DEBUG="-g"


## Adds code to the kernel that does internal consistency checks, and will
## cause the kernel to panic if corruption of internal data structures
## is detected.
#options 	DIAGNOSTIC	# extra kernel sanity checking

## Enable (possibly expensive) debugging code that may also display messages
## on the system console
#options 	DEBUG

## Make SCSI error messages more verbose when explaining their meanings.
options 	SCSIVERBOSE

## `INSECURE' turns off the kernel security level (securelevel = 0 always).
## This allows writing to /dev/mem, loading kernel modules while multi-user,
## and other insecurities good only for development work.  Do not use this
## option on a production machine.
options 	INSECURE

## `FDSCRIPTS' allows non-readable but executable scripts by providing a
## pre-opened opaque file to the script interpreter.  `SETUIDSCRIPTS',
## which implies FDSCRIPTS, allows scripts to be set-user-id using the same
## opaque file mechanism.  Perl calls this "secure setuid scripts."

#options 	FDSCRIPTS
#options 	SETUIDSCRIPTS

## Options for compatibility with previous releases foreign system binaries.
## In the cases of COMPAT_SUNOS and COMPAT_SVR4, you may need to set up
## additional user-level utilities or system configuration files. See
## compat_sunos(8) and compat_svr4(8).

options 	COMPAT_43	# 4.3BSD system interfaces
