 * Common timer, clock and eeprom routines.

 * Overview of timer and time-of-day devices on sparc machines:
 *
 * sun4/100 & sun4/200
 *	have the Intersil 7170 time-of-day and timer chip (oclock.c)
 *	eeprom device in OBIO space (eeprom.c)
 *
 * sun4/300 & sun4/400
 *	Mostek MK48T02 clock/nvram device, includes eeprom (mkclock.c)
 *	2 system timers (timer.c)
 *
 * sun4c
 *	Mostek MK48T02 or MK48T08 clock/nvram device (mkclock.c)
 *	system timer in OBIO space
 *	2 system timers (timer.c)
 *
 * sun4m
 *	Mostek MK48T08 clock/nvram device (mkclock.c)
 *	1 global system timer (timer.c)
 *	1 configurable counter/timer per CPU (timer.c)
 *
 * microSPARC-IIep:
 *	DS1287A time-of-day chip on EBUS (dev/rtc.c)
 *	the system timer is part of the PCI controller (timer.c)
 *
 * All system use the timer interrupt (at IPL 10) to drive hardclock().
 * The second or per-CPU timer interrupt (at IPL 14) is used to drive
 * statclock() (except on sun4/100 and sun4/200 machines, which don't
 * have a spare timer device).
