 * eeprom driver. Sun 4 machines use the old-style (a'la Sun 3) EEPROM.
 * On the 4/100's and 4/200's, this is at a separate obio space.
 * On the 4/300's and 4/400's, however, it is the cl_nvram[] chunk of
 * the Mostek chip.  Therefore, eeprom_match will only return true on
 * the 100/200 models, and the eeprom will be attached separately.
 * On the 300/400 models, the eeprom will be dealt with when the clock
 * is attached.
