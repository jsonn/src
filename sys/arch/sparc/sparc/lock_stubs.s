 * THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN WE ADD SUPPORT FOR KERNEL PREEMPTION.
 *
 * There is a critical section within mutex_exit(); if we are
 * preempted, between checking for waiters and releasing the
 * lock, then we must check for waiters again.
 *
 * On some architectures, we could simply disable interrupts
 * (and, thus, preemption) for the short duration of this 
 * critical section.
 *      
 * On others, where disabling interrupts might be too expensive,
 * a restartable sequence could be used; in the interrupt handler,
 * if the PC is within the critical section, then then PC should
 * be reset to the beginning of the critical section so that the
 * sequence will be restarted when we are resumed.  NOTE: In this
 * case, it is very important that the insn that actually clears
 * the lock must NEVER be executed twice.
 *
 * On the sparc, we will use a restartable sequence.
 * XXX BUT WE DON'T RIGHT NOW!
