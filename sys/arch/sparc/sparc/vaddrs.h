/*
 * Special (fixed) virtual addresses on the SPARC.
 *
 * IO virtual space begins at 0xfe000000 (a segment boundary) and
 * continues up to the DMVA edge at 0xff000000.  (The upper all-1s
 * byte is special since some of the hardware supplies this to pad
 * a 24-bit address space out to 32 bits.  This is a legacy of the
 * IBM PC AT bus, actually, just so you know who to blame.)
 *
 * We reserve several pages at the base of our IO virtual space
 * for `oft-used' devices which must be present anyway in order to
 * configure.  In particular, we want the counter-timer register and
 * the Zilog ZSCC serial port chips to be mapped at fixed VAs to make
 * microtime() and the zs hardware interrupt handlers faster.
 *
 * [sun4/sun4c:]
 * Ideally, we should map the interrupt enable register here as well,
 * but that would require allocating pmegs in locore.s, so instead we
 * use one of the two `wasted' pages at KERNBASE+_MAXNBPG (see locore.s).

 * The next constant defines the amount of reserved DVMA space on the
 * Sun4m. The amount of space *must* be a multiple of 16MB, and thus
 * (((u_int)0) - DVMA4M_BASE) must be divisible by 16*1024*1024!
 * Note that pagetables must be allocated at a cost of 1k per MB of DVMA
 * space, plus severe alignment restrictions. So don't make DVMA4M_BASE too
 * low (max space = 2G).
 *
 * Since DVMA space overlaps with normal kernel address space (notably
 * the device mappings and the PROM), we don't want to put any DVMA
 * mappings where any of this useful stuff is (i.e. if we dvma_malloc
 * a buffer, we want to still have a SRMMU mapping to it, and we can't
 * have that if its on top of kernel code). Thus the last two
 * constants define the actual DVMA addresses used. These can be anything
 * as long as they are within the bounds setup by the first 2 constants.
 * This is especially important on MP systems with cache coherency: to
 * avoid consistency problems, DVMA addresses must map to the same place
 * in both processor and IOMMU space.
