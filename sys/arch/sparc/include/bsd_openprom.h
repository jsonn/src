 * In addition to the global stuff defined in the PROM vectors above,

 * nodes are arranged into an N-ary tree.  Each node implements a fixed
 * set of functions, as described below.  The first two deal with the tree
 * structure, allowing traversals in either breadth- or depth-first fashion.
 * The rest deal with `properties'.
 *
 * A node property is simply a name/value pair.  The names are C strings
 * (NUL-terminated); the values are arbitrary byte strings (counted strings).
 * Many values are really just C strings.  Sometimes these are NUL-terminated,
 * sometimes not, depending on the interface version; v0 seems to terminate
 * and v2 not.  Many others are simply integers stored as four bytes in
 * machine order: you just get them and go.  The third popular format is
 * an `physical address', which is made up of one or more sets of three
 * integers as defined above.
 *
 * N.B.: for the `next' functions, next(0) = first, and next(last) = 0.
 * Whoever designed this part had good taste.  On the other hand, these
 * operation vectors are global, rather than per-node, yet the pointers
 * are not in the openprom vectors but rather found by indirection from
 * there.  So the taste balances out.
