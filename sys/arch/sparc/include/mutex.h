/*
 * There sparc mutex implementation is troublesome, because sparc (v7 and
 * v8) lacks a compare-and-set operation, yet there are many SMP sparc
 * machines in circulation.  SMP for spin mutexes is easy - we don't need
 * to know who owns the lock.  For adaptive mutexes, we need an aditional
 * interlock.
 *
 * The locked byte set by the sparc 'ldstub' instruction is 0xff.  sparc
 * kernels are always loaded above 0xe0000000, and the low 5 bits of any
 * "struct lwp *" are always zero.  So, to record the lock owner, we only
 * need 23 bits of space.  mtxa_owner contains the mutex owner's address
 * shifted right by 5: the top three bits of which will always be 0xe,
 * overlapping with the interlock at the top byte, which is always 0xff
 * when the mutex is held.
 *
 * For a mutex acquisition, the owner field is set in two steps: first,
 * acquire the interlock (top byte), and second OR in the owner's address. 
 * Once the owner field is non zero, it will appear that the mutex is held,
 * by which LWP it does not matter: other LWPs competing for the lock will
 * fall through to mutex_vector_enter(), and either spin or sleep.
 *
 * As a result there is no space for a waiters bit in the owner field.  No
 * problem, because it would be hard to synchronise using one without a CAS
 * operation.  Note that in order to do unlocked release of adaptive
 * mutexes, we need the effect of MUTEX_SET_WAITERS() to be immediatley
 * visible on the bus.  So, adaptive mutexes share the spin lock byte with
 * spin mutexes (set with ldstub), but it is not treated as a lock in its
 * own right, rather as a flag that can be atomically set or cleared.
 *
 * When releasing an adaptive mutex, we first clear the owners field, and
 * then check to see if the waiters byte is set.  This ensures that there
 * will always be someone to wake any sleeping waiters up (even it the mutex
 * is acquired immediately after we release it, or if we are preempted
 * immediatley after clearing the owners field).  The setting or clearing of
 * the waiters byte is serialized by the turnstile chain lock associated
 * with the mutex.
 *
 * See comments in kern_mutex.c about releasing adaptive mutexes without
 * an interlocking step.
