0. What is this? 

  This program load the NetBSD/hpcmips kernel and execute it.

  - All data on your PDA will be lost if the kernel boot successfully.
  - NetBSD/hpcmips kernel is ELF format binary executable.
  - This program supports only MIPS (especially NEC VR41X1 or VR4102 CPU)
    platforms -- NEC MC-R series, CASIO E- series, Everex Freestyle and 
    others.

1. How to use

  - Copy pbsdboot.exe and the kernel 'netbsd into your PDA and start
    pbsdboot.exe.
  - Select 'kernel name' and 'Frame buffer' appropriately.
  - Push [boot] button.

2. How to compile

  Use Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 and Windows CE toolkit for VC++ 5.0. It also
  needs Embedded toolkit for accessing raw block device to support native
  file system, FFS.

  VC++ 6.0 and toolkit 6.0 may works. But I've never tried.

3. About version string

  If you modify this program and update pbsdboot.exe.uue, change version string
  which is coded in main.c appropriately.

  The version string is in format:

    Version A.B.C YYYY.MM.DD

  in where:

    A: Don't change this.
    B: Increment this number if you change program's behavior, fix some bugs
       or add new features.
    C: Increment this number if you change/add some parameters, constants or
       windows' resources
    YYYY.MM.DD: date
