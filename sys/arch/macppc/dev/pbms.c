/*
 * The pbms driver provides support for the trackpad on new (post
 * February 2005) Apple PowerBooks (and iBooks?) that are not standard
 * USB HID mice.
 */

/*
 * The protocol (that is, the interpretation of the data generated by
 * the trackpad) is taken from the Linux appletouch driver version
 * 0.08 by Johannes Berg, Stelian Pop and Frank Arnold.  The method
 * used to detect fingers on the trackpad is also taken from that
 * driver.
 */

/*
 * To add support for other devices using the same protocol, add an
 * entry to the pbms_devices table below.  See the comments for
 * pbms_devices and struct pbms_devs.
 */

/*
 * PROTOCOL:
 *
 * The driver transfers continuously 81 byte events.  The last byte is
 * 1 if the button is pressed, and is 0 otherwise. Of the remaining
 * bytes, 26 + 16 = 42 are sensors detecting pressure in the X or
 * horizontal, and Y or vertical directions, respectively.  On 12 and
 * 15 inch PowerBooks, only the 16 first sensors in the X-direction
 * are used. In the X-direction, the sensors correspond to byte
 * positions
 * 
 *   2, 7, 12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39, 42,
 *   47, 52, 57, 62, 67, 72, 77, 44 and 49;
 * 
 * in the Y direction, the sensors correspond to byte positions
 *
 *   1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36, 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33 and 38.
 *
 * The change in the sensor values over time is more interesting than
 * their absolute values: if the pressure increases, we know that the
 * finger has just moved there.
 *
 * We keep track of the previous sample (of sensor values in the X and
 * Y directions) and the accumulated change for each sensor.  When we
 * receive a new sample, we add the difference of the new sensor value
 * and the old value to the accumulated change.  If the accumulator
 * becomes negative, we set it to zero.  The effect is that the
 * accumulator is large for sensors whose pressure has recently
 * increased.  If there is little change in pressure (or if the
 * pressure decreases), the accumulator drifts back to zero.
 *
 * Since there is some fluctuations, we ignore accumulator values
 * below a threshold.  The raw finger position is computed as a
 * weighted average of the other sensors (the weights are the
 * accumulated changes).
 *
 * For smoothing, we keep track of the previous raw finger position,
 * and the virtual position reported to wsmouse.  The new raw position
 * is computed as a weighted average of the old raw position and the
 * computed raw position.  Since this still generates some noise, we
 * compute a new virtual position as a weighted average of the previous
 * virtual position and the new raw position.  The weights are
 * controlled by the raw change and a noise parameter.  The position
 * is reported as a relative position.  
 */

/*
 * TODO:
 *
 * Add support for other drivers of the same type.
 *
 * Add support for tapping and two-finger scrolling?  The
 * implementation already detects two fingers, so this should be
 * relatively easy.
 *
 * Implement some of the mouse ioctls?
 *
 * Take care of the XXXs.

 * noise:     Amount of noise in the computed position. This controls
 *            how large a change must be to get reported, and how 
 *            large enough changes are smoothed.  A good value can

 *            16 seems suitable.
 *
 * product:   The product ID of the trackpad.
 *
 * 
 * threshold: Accumulated changes less than this are ignored.  A good 
 *            value could be determined experimentally, but 5 is a
 *            reasonable guess.
 *
 * vendor:    The vendor ID.  Currently USB_VENDOR_APPLE for all devices.
 *
 * x_factor:  Factor used in computations with X-coordinates.  If the
 *            x-resolution of the display is x, this should be 
 *            (x + 1) / (x_sensors - 1).  Other values work fine, but
 *            then the aspect ratio is not necessarily kept.
 *
 * x_sensors: The number of sensors in the X-direction.
 *
 * y_factor:  As x_factors, but for Y-coordinates.
 *
 * y_sensors: The number of sensors in the Y-direction.
