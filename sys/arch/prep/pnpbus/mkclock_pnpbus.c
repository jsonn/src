/*
 * Mostek MK48T18 time-of-day chip attachment to pnpbus, using two
 * 8-bit ports for address selection and one 8-bit port for data.
 *
 * Note that this is essentially a stub driver. We cannot attach the clock
 * with this driver because the clock and nvram part are one in the same, and
 * share the same IO ports.  If we attach the clock, the NVRAM driver will
 * fail to attach.  Instead, we note that we have an mk48txx device, and in
 * the nvram driver, we will attach the clock goop there.
 *
 * Therefore the probe will always fail.
