 * Since the SCSI standard tends to hide the disk structure, we define
 * partitions in terms of DEV_BSIZE blocks.  The default partition table
 * (for an unlabeled disk) reserves 512K for a boot area, has an 8 meg
 * root (A) and 32 meg of swap (B).  The rest of the space on the drive
 * goes in the G partition.  As usual, the C partition covers the entire
 * disk (including the boot area).
 *
 * We also define the D, E, F and H partitions as an alternative to B and G.
 * D is 48Mb, starts after A and is intended for swapping.
 * E is 50Mb, starts after D and is intended for /usr.
 * F starts after E and is what ever is left.
 * H starts after D and is what ever is left (i.e. combo of E and F).
