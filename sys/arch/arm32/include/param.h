 * The layout of the area looks like this
 *
 * | user area | FP context | undefined stack | kernel stack |
 *
 * The size of the user area is known.
 * The size of the FP context is variable depending of the FP emulator
 * in use and whether there is hardware FP support. However we can put
 * an upper limit on it.
 * The undefined stack needs to be at least 512 bytes. This is a requirement
 * if the FP emulators
 * The kernel stack should be at least 4K is size.
 *
 * The stack top addresses are used to set the stack pointers. The stack bottom
 * addresses at the addresses monitored by the diagnostic code for stack overflows
