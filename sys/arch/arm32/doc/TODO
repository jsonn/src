Ok this is the current todo list.

There are a number of things that need to be done that I do not
have time to do and am unlikely to have time to do them in the near
future. These are currently being left in the hope that users will do them
instead and are marked with *.

1.  replace netinet/in_cksum.c with an assembly version (*)
2.  replace netns/ns_chsum.c with an assembly version (*)
3.  drivers for currently unsupported podules (*)
4.  replacing the C string functions in libc with assembly ones (work
    started but not finished) (*)
5.  porting libpthread to arm32 architecture (*)
6.  the ARM FPE postproc handler should check need_resched and CURSIG()
    in the assembly glue and only switch to SVC and do a userret() if
    required. UNDER DEVELOPMENT
7.  L1 page tables should be freed when a process is swapped out and
    reallocated when the process is swapped in.
8.  bcopy() needs optimising. (*)
9.  cleanup video DRAM support on machine with VRAM
10. clean up prototype declarations
11. support reading and writing the rtc device UNDER DEVELOPMENT
13. debug / replace console code. UNDER DEVELOPMENT
14. fix FPA probing. UNDER DEVELOPMENT
15. optimise ARM FPE glue code. UNDER DEVELOPMENT
16. modify wd.c to avoid using the softc in the probe function
17. fix mainbus configuration code
18. optimise irq delivery code
19. improve fiq handling code
20. Debug kernel linking with the NetBSD linker
21. Complete hydra support
22. Debug GCC/arm
23. PIC support in GCC/arm
24. Shared libraries
25. Remove debug.c
26. Remove stubs.c
27. Remove kshell/*
28. Remove postmortem.c
29. Debug audio drivers
30. Merge in lmcaudio driver for the RC7500.
31. 16 bit sound driver.
32. Create generic SEEQ8004/8005 driver.
33. Create ea and eb front ends for the generic SEEQ driver.
34. Replace EtherH driver with new version UNDER DEVELOPMENT
35. Merge in Ether2 driver
36. Reorganise kernel VM space
37. Implement DMA transfers to buffer memory for the asc driver.
38. Add interrupt and DMA support to the cosc driver
39. Write ADFS filesystem (*)
40. Optimise Strong ARM support UNDER DEVELOPMENT
41. Debug multiple mappings in pmap.c UNDER DEVELOPMENT
42. Optimise data xfers for the ea and eb drivers
43. Debug printer support
44. Update drivers to use new bus space macros UNDER DEVELOPMENT
45. Develop ICS IDE driver UNDER DEVELOPMENT
46. Develop Cumana SCSI I driver
47. Kernel multithreading
48. Kernel mutliprocessor support
49. Removed dependancy on IOMD.
50. Split code dependant on RiscPC's into separate files.
51. Rewrite IDE driver, split into ATA, ATAPI, wd devices etc.
52. Removed dependancy on VIDC20.
53. Debug serial consoles.
54. Develop RapIDE driver UNDER DEVELOPMENT
55. Restructure config and attach of IOMD dependant devices.
56. Implement EtherM driver
57. Create generic DMA handling routines
58. Implement PIOC driver as parent for wd, fd, com & lpt.
59. the podule attach args should pass the interrupt number for
    podule or network slot so that the podulebus is the only
    driver that needs to know about the irq numbers.
60. A mechanism for obtaining the MAC address for netslot cards
    is needed instead of drivers building it from the bootconfig
    machine ID.
61. Implement interrupts on the Connect32 driver
62. Debug IOMD DMA handling.
63. Implement driver for etherlan500 podule
64. Improve com driver.
