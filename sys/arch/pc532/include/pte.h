/*
 * ns32532 MMU hardware structure:
 *
 * The ns32532 MMU is a two-level MMU which maps 4GB of virtual memory.
 * The pagesize is 4K (4096 [0x1000] bytes).
 *
 * The first level table is called a "page directory" and it contains
 * 1024 page directory entries (PDEs). Each PDE is 4 bytes (an int),
 * so a PD fits in a single 4K page. This page is the page directory
 * page (PDP). Each PDE in a PDP maps 4MB of space (1024 * 4MB = 4GB).
 * A PDE contains the physical address of the second level
 * table: The page table.
 *
 * A page table consists of 1024 page table entries (PTEs). Each PTE is
 * 4 bytes (an int), so a page table also fits in a single 4K page. A 4K
 * page being used as a page table is called a page table page (PTP).
 * Each PTE in a PTP maps one 4K page (1024 * 4K = 4MB). A PTE contains
 * the physical address of the page it maps and some flag bits (described
 * below).
 *
 * The processor has a special register, "ptb0", which points to the
 * the PDP which is currently controlling the mappings of the virtual
 * address space.
 *
 * The following picture shows the translation process for a 4K page:
 *
 * ptb0 register [PA of PDP]
 *      |
 *      |
 *      |   bits <31-22> of VA         bits <21-12> of VA   bits <11-0>
 *      |   index the PDP (0 - 1023)   index the PTP        are the page offset
 *      |         |                           |                  |
 *      |         v                           |                  |

 *                                      +------------+       |   |
 *                                                           |   |
 *                                                bits <31-12>   bits <11-0>

 *
 * The ns32532 caches PTEs in a TLB. It is important to flush out old
 * TLB mappings when making a change to a mappings. Writing to the
 * ptb0 register will flush the entire TLB. The ns32532 also has an
 * instruction that will invalidate the mapping of a single page (which
 * is useful if you are changing a single page's mappings because it
 * preserves all the cached TLB entries).
 *
 * As shows, bits 31-12 of the PTE contain PA of the page being mapped.
 * the rest of the PTE is defined as follows:
 *   bit#	name	use
 *   11		n/a	available for OS use, hardware ignores it
 *   10		n/a	available for OS use, hardware ignores it
 *   9		n/a	available for OS use, hardware ignores it
 *   8		M	modified page
 *   7		R	referenced page
 *   6		CI	cache inhibited page
 *   5		n/a	reserved
 *   4		n/a	reserved
 *   3		n/a	reserved
 *   2		U/S	user/supervisor bit (0=supervisor only, 1=both u&s)
 *   1		R/W	read/write bit (0=read only, 1=read-write)
 *   0		V	valid page
 *
 * notes:
 *  - Useraccessible pages (U/S == 1) are *always* writable in kernel mode.
 *    copyout and friends use the ns32532's dual address space instructions
 *    for this reason.
