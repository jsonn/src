/* The prototypes for C
   with a little explanation

	unsigned char * InitNCR(volatile void * BoardAddress, struct MonDef * md = &MON_640_512_60);

   This routine initialises the Retina hardware, opens a
   text- or gfx-mode screen, depending on the value of MonDef.DEP,
   and sets the cursor to position 0.
   It takes as arguments a pointer to the hardware-base
   address as it is denoted in the DevConf structure
   of the AmigaDOS, and a pointer to a struct MonDef
   which describes the screen-mode parameters.

   The routine returns 0 if it was unable to open the screen,
   or an unsigned char * to the display/attribute memory
   when it succeeded. The organisation of the display memory
   is a little strange in text-mode (Intel-typically...) :

   Byte  00    01    02    03    04     05    06   etc.
       Char0  Attr0  --    --   Char1 Attr1   --   etc.

   You may set a character and its associated attribute byte
   with a single word-access, or you may perform to byte writes
   for the char and attribute. Each 2. word has no meaning,
   and writes to theese locations are ignored.

   The attribute byte for each character has the following
   structure:

   Bit  7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0
      BLINK BACK2 BACK1 BACK0 FORE3 FORE2 FORE1 FORE0

   Were FORE is the foreground-color index (0-15) and
   BACK is the background color index (0-7). BLINK
   enables blinking for the associated character.
   The higher 8 colors in the standard palette are
   lighter than the lower 8, so you may see FORE3 as
   an intensity bit. If FORE == 1 or FORE == 9 and
   BACK == 0 the character is underlined. Since I don't
   think this looks good, it will probably change in a
   future release.

   There's no routine "SetChar" or "SetAttr" provided,
   because I think it's so trivial... a function call
   would be pure overhead. As an example, a routine
   to set the char code and attribute at position x,y:
   (assumed the value returned by InitNCR was stored
    into "DispMem", the actual MonDef struct * is hold
    in "MDef")

   void SetChar(unsigned char chr, unsigned char attr,
                unsigned short x, unsigned short y) {

      unsigned struct MonDef * md = MDef;
      unsigned char * c = DispMem + x*4 + y*md->TX*4;

      *c++ = chr;
      *c   = attr;

   }

   In Gfx-mode, the memory organisation is rather simple,
   1 byte per pixel in 256-color mode, one pixel after
   each other, line by line.

   Currently, InitNCR() disables the Retina VBLANK IRQ,
   but beware: When running the Retina WB-Emu under
   AmigaDOS, the VBLANK IRQ is ENABLED.

	void SetCursorPos(unsigned short pos);

   This routine sets the hardware-cursor position
   to the screen location pos. pos can be calculated
   as (x + y * md->TY).
   Text-mode only!

	void ScreenUp(void);

   A somewhat optimized routine that scrolls the whole
   screen up one row. A good idea to compile this piece
   of code with optimization enabled.
   Text-mode only!

	void ScreenDown(void);

   A somewhat optimized routine that scrolls the whole
   screen down one row. A good idea to compile this piece
   of code with optimization enabled.
   Text-mode only!

	unsigned char * SetSegmentPtr(unsigned long address);

   Sets the beginning of the 64k-memory segment to the
   address specified by the unsigned long. If address MOD 64
   is != 0, the return value will point to the segments
   start in the Amiga address space + (address MOD 64).
   Don't use more than (65536-64) bytes in the segment
   you set if you aren't sure that (address MOD 64) == 0.
   See retina.doc from MS for further information.

	void ClearScreen(unsigned char color);

   Fills the whole screen with "color" - 256-color mode only!

	void LoadPalette(unsigned char * pal, unsigned char firstcol,
	                 unsigned char colors);

   Loads the palette-registers. "pal" points to an array of unsigned char
   triplets, for the red, green and blue component. "firstcol" determines the
   number of the first palette-register to load (256 available). "colors"
   is the number of colors you want to put in the palette registers.

	void SetPalette(unsigned char colornum, unsigned char red,
	                unsigned char green, unsigned char blue);

   Allows you to set a single color in the palette, "colornum" is the number
   of the palette entry (256 available), "red", "green" and "blue" are the
   three components.

	void SetPanning(unsigned short xoff, unsigned short yoff);

   Moves the logical coordinate (xoff, yoff) to the upper left corner
   of your screen. Of course, you shouldn't specify excess values that would
   show garbage in the lower right area of your screen... SetPanning()
   does NOT check for boundaries.
