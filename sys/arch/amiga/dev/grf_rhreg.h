/* The prototypes for C */
/* with a little explanation */

	unsigned char * RZ3Init(volatile void * BoardAddress, struct MonDef * md);

/*
 * This routine initialises the Retina Z3 hardware, opens a
 * text- or gfx-mode screen, depending on the value of
 * MonDef.DEP, and sets the cursor to position 0.
 * It takes as arguments a pointer to the hardware-base
 * address as it is denoted in the DevConf structure
 * of the AmigaDOS, and a pointer to a struct MonDef
 * which describes the screen-mode parameters.
 *
 * The routine returns 0 if it was unable to open the screen,
 * or an unsigned char * to the display memory when it
 * succeeded.
 *
 * The organisation of the display memory in text-mode is a
 * little strange (Intel-typically...) :
 *
 * Byte  00    01    02    03    04     05    06   etc.
 *     Char0  Attr0  --    --   Char1 Attr1   --   etc.
 *
 * You may set a character and its associated attribute byte
 * with a single word-access, or you may perform to byte writes
 * for the char and attribute. Each 2. word has no meaning,
 * and writes to theese locations are ignored.
 *
 * The attribute byte for each character has the following
 * structure:
 *
 * Bit  7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0
 *    BLINK BACK2 BACK1 BACK0 FORE3 FORE2 FORE1 FORE0
 *
 * Were FORE is the foreground-color index (0-15) and
 * BACK is the background color index (0-7). BLINK
 * enables blinking for the associated character.
 * The higher 8 colors in the standard palette are
 * lighter than the lower 8, so you may see FORE3 as
 * an intensity bit. If FORE == 1 or FORE == 9 and
 * BACK == 0 the character is underlined. Since I don't
 * think this looks good, it will probably change in a
 * future release.
 *
 * There's no routine "SetChar" or "SetAttr" provided,
 * because I think it's so trivial... a function call
 * would be pure overhead. As an example, a routine
 * to set the char code and attribute at position x,y:
 * (assumed the value returned by RZ3Init was stored
 *  into "DispMem", the actual MonDef struct * is hold
 *  in "MDef")
 *
 * void SetChar(unsigned char chr, unsigned char attr,
 *              unsigned short x, unsigned short y) {
 *
 *    unsigned struct MonDef * md = MDef;
 *    unsigned char * c = DispMem + x*4 + y*md->TX*4;
 *
 *    *c++ = chr;
 *    *c   = attr;
 *
 * }
 *
 * In gfx-mode, the memory organisation is rather simple,
 * 1 byte per pixel in 256-color mode, one pixel after
 * each other, line by line.
 *
 * When 16-bits per pixel are used, each two bytes represent
 * one pixel. The meaning of the bits is the following:
 *
 * Bit       15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
 * Component g2 g1 g0 b4 b3 b2 b1 b0 r4 r3 r2 r1 r0 g5 g4 g3
 *
 * Please note that the memory layout in gfx-mode depends
 * on the logical screen-size, panning does only affect
 * the appearance of the physical screen.
 *
 * Currently, RZ3Init() disables the Retina Z3 VBLANK IRQ,
 * but beware: When running the Retina WB-Emu under
 * AmigaDOS, the VBLANK IRQ is ENABLED...
