 *  this file provides an interface to CIA-generated interrupts.
 *  Since the interrupt control register of a CIA is cleared
 *  when it's read, it is essential that different interrupt
 *  sources are managed from one central handler, or interrupts
 *  can get lost.
 *
 *  if you write a handler dealing with a yet unused interrupt
 *  bit (handler == not_used), enter your interrupt handler
 *  in the appropriate table below. If your handler must poll
 *  for an interrupt flag to come active, *always* call
 *  dispatch_cia_ints() afterwards with bits in the mask
 *  register your code didn't already deal with.
