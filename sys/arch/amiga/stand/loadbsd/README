This was prepared to compile with gcc 2.7.0 for AmigaOS and 
libnix 1.0. You don't need ixemul or special directories to run the
binary, if compiled that way.

With very old versions of gcc, you might need to add +2-. to relative
offsets in the assembler part, but honestly, I suggest you upgrade your
assembler (and compiler) instead, even if you know what I'm talking about 
and how to identify the lines.

You'll need the (unchanged) getopt.c from src/lib/libc/stdlib, too.

With newer libnix or the ADE version of gcc, or when removing the
-noixemul option from CFLAGS, you might need (or want) to delete the 
sleep() function at the bottom of loadbsd, or getopt.o from the 
"OBJS =" line of Makefile.

[Sorry, but I didn't dare to risk my gcc installation a few weeks 
 before the release by trying to install ADE]
