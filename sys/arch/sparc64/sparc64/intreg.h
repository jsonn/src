 * All sun4u interrupts arrive as interrupt packets.  These packets
 * consist of up to six (three on spitfires) quads.  The first one
 * contains the interrupt number.  This is either the device ID
 * or a pointer to the handler routine.
 * 
 * Device IDs are split into two parts: a 5-bit interrupt group number
 * and a 5-bit interrupt number.  We ignore this distinction.
