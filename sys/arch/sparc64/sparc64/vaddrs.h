 * Special (fixed) virtual addresses on the SPARC.
 *
 * IO virtual space begins at 0xfe000000 (a segment boundary) and
 * continues up to the DMVA edge at 0xff000000.  (The upper all-1s
 * byte is special since some of the hardware supplies this to pad
 * a 24-bit address space out to 32 bits.  This is a legacy of the
 * IBM PC AT bus, actually, just so you know who to blame.)
