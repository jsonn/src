/*
 * The following types provide the kernel with information on what
 * sort of machine we're running on.  This is passed at the end of
 * the boot arguments, which is a contiguous memory region which
 * looks like this:
 *
 *	/pci/scsi@3/disk@0,0:1/netbsd -s<NUL><esym><tag>
 *
 * The post-<NUL> values are:
 *
 *	<esym>	end of the kernel symbol table (32-bits)
 *
 *	<tag>	machine type tag (32-bits)
 *
 * The pre-<NUL> portion of the boot arguments may be interpreted
 * differently depending on the machine tag.
 *
 * If the tag indicates that the system has OpenFirmware, then
 * OpenFirmware will be used to get additional system information.
 *
 * If the tag indicates that the system has Motorola BUG, then
 * BUG will be used to get additional system information.
