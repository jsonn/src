/*
 * Usage:
 *
 * ppmtochrpicon [ppmfile]
 *
 * This programs reads from either a single file given as an argument
 * or from stdin if no args are given. It tries to find a <ICON...>
 * tag in the file and read a CHRP style ASCII boot icon. It is not
 * overly intelligent at dealing with other confusing stuff in the 
 * file or weird formatting due to the specialized nature of the input
 * files.
 *
 * It then produces a PPM file on stdout containing the boot icon's image.
