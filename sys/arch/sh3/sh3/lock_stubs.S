 *	Atomic compare-and-swap for kernel use.  SuperH machines are
 *	uniprocessor, so we need to be atomic only w.r.t. interrupts.
 *	Implement this as (the only in-kernel) RAS, with restart check
 *	done on return from interrupt.
 *
 *	Mutex stubs below depend on this function:
 *	    r4 - preserved, passed along to mutex_vector_{enter,exit}
 *	    r7 - preserved, used to save pr (to avoid touching stack)
 *	     T - still reflects cas success status (to avoid another test)
