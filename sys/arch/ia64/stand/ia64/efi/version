NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE BOOTBLOCKS HERE.  The format of this
file is important.  Make sure the current version number is on line 6.

1.1:	Pass the HCDP table address to the kernel via bootinfo if one
	is present in the EFI system table.
1.0:	Don't map the I/O port range. We expect the kernel to do it. It
	was done in the loader as a debugging aid and not intended as a
	service/feature.
0.3:	Pass the physical address of the bootinfo block in register r8
	to the kernel. Continue to put it at the fixed address for now.
0.2:	Much improved version. Significant is the support for passing
	the FPSWA interface pointer to the kernel.
0.1:	Initial EFI version, germinated from the NetBSD i386
	standalone, but enormously modified.
