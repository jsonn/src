$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.6.12.1 2008/06/23 04:30:17 wrstuden Exp $

Things yet to do:

- Update installation note (mention Restore CD?)
- Integrate restorecd into the tree?
- Add kloader(8) support, so that we could load a RAMDISK root install kernel
  from any device which is supported by kernel
  (should be trivial, but needs rethink how to pass bootinfo)
- Configure PCI interrupts properly for boards which have PCI bridges
- Handle more GT64x11 interrupts (PCI timeout etc.)
- Add console support with com(4) at puc(4) so that QUBE2700 could have console
