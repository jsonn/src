$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.4 2006/07/18 13:24:39 tsutsui Exp $

Things yet to do:

- Update installation note (mention Restore CD?)
- sysinst based installer
  (maybe we need non-GPLed newfs_ext2fs(8) first)
- Add kloader(8) support, so that we could load a RAMDISK root install kernel
  via network (should be trivial, but needs rethink how to pass bootinfo)
- Parse command line options on bootloader (RB_SINGLE, RB_ASKNAME etc.)
- Configure PCI interrupts properly for boards which have PCI bridges or
  multiple functions (i.e. boards which use multiple interrupts)
- Handle more GT64x11 interrupts (PCI timeout etc.)
- Add console support with com(4) at puc(4) so that QUBE2700 could have console
- Add "optional" zs(4) support for QUBE2700

- Fix TLB miss panic in bus_dmamap_sync(9) with BUS_DMASYNC_PREWRITE
  (this may be MI mips issue and workaround is adding options SOSEND_NO_LOAN)
