 * 	The architected FP Control word. It should forever begin at bit 1,
 * 	as the bits are AARM specified and this way it doesn't need to be
 * 	shifted.
 * 
 * 	Until C99 there was never an IEEE 754 API, making most of the
 * 	standard useless.  Because of overlapping AARM, OSF/1, NetBSD, and
 * 	C99 API's, the use of the MDP_FP_C bits is defined variously in
 * 	ieeefp.h and fpu.h.
