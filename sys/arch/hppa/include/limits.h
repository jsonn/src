 * According to ANSI (section 2.2.4.2), the values below must be usable by
 * #if preprocessing directives.  Additionally, the expression must have the
 * same type as would an expression that is an object of the corresponding
 * type converted according to the integral promotions.  The subtraction for
 * INT_MIN and LONG_MIN is so the value is not unsigned; 2147483648 is an
 * unsigned int for 32-bit two's complement ANSI compilers (section 3.1.3.2).
 * These numbers work for pcc as well.  The UINT_MAX and ULONG_MAX values
 * are written as hex so that GCC will be quiet about large integer constants.
