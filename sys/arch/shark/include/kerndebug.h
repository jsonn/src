**  ABSTRACT:
**
**      This  header provides generic debugging capabilities using printf.
**      All debugging can be compiled out by not defining the
**      KERNEL_DEBUG macro. In addition the amount of debug output is 
**      defined by individual variables controlled by each subsystem 
**      using this utility. Finally note that the two middle bytes of
**      the kern debug flags (bits 16 to 23) are free for individual 
**      subsystems to use as they please (eg. define switches for 
**      individual functions etc).
