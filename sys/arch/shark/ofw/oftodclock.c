/* The OFW RTC interface, straight from wmb:

selftest  ( -- error? )
	Designed to be called from the "test" user interface command, e.g.
		test /rtc
	which displays a message if the test fails.
	Basically all this does is to check the battery.

check-battery  ( -- error? )
	Called from an open instance; returns non-zero if the battery
	is dead.  Also displays a message to that effect, which it probably
	should not do.

set-time  ( s m h d m y -- )
get-time  ( -- s m h d m y )
	Called from an open instance.
	seconds: 0-59
	minutes: 0-59
	hours: 0-23

	month: 1-12
