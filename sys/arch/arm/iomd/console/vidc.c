/* VIDC STUFF */

/*
 * A structure containing ALL the information required to restore
 * the VIDC20 to any given state.  ALL vidc transactions should
 * go through these procedures, which record the vidc's state.
 * it may be an idea to set the permissions of the vidc base address
 * so we get a fault, so the fault routine can record the state but
 * I guess that's not really necessary for the time being, since we
 * can make the kernel more secure later on.  Also, it is possible
 * to write a routine to allow 'reading' of the vidc registers.
