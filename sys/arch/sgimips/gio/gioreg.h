/*
 * The GIO Product Identification Word is the first word (1 or 4 bytes)
 * in each GIO device's address space. It is the same format for GIO32,
 * GIO32-bis, and GIO64 devices. The macros below extract the following
 * fields:
 *
 * Bits:
 *    0-6 Product ID Code
 *	7 Product Identification Word size (0: 8 bits, 1: 32 bits)
 *   8-15 Product Revision
 *     16 GIO Interface Size (0: 32, 1: 64; NB: GIO64 devices may be 32)
 *     17 Rom Present (1: present)
 *  18-31 Manufacturer-specific Code
 *
 * The upper three bytes containing the Product Revision, GIO Interface
 * Size, Rom Presence indicator, and Manufacturer-specific Code are only 
 * valid if bit 7 is set in the Product ID Word. If it is not set, all
 * values default to 0.
 *
 * If the Rom Present bit is set, the three words after the Product ID are
 * reserved for three ROM registers:
 *	Board Serial Number Register	(base_address + 0x4)
 *	ROM Index Register		(base_address + 0x8)
 *	ROM Read Register		(base_address + 0xc)
 *
 * The ROM Index Register is initialised by the CPU to 0 and incremented by
 * 4 on each read from the ROM Read Register. The Board Serial Number
 * Register contains a manufacturer-specific serial number.
