# sgimips GENERIC kernel for IP12
#
# The IP12 is very, very similar to the IP2x, with one important difference:
# it is MIPS1.  This means that we cannot produce a kernel that works on both
# architectures.
#
# To keep things simple, include the IP2x kernel config and "no option" the
# offending bits.

# Pull in standard `install' config
include 	"arch/sgimips/conf/GENERIC32_IP2x"

no options	MIPS3
