/*
 * DCR is an user accesible bus on Xilinx PPC405D5Xn cores and may contain
 * arbitrary devices. Because we want to be able to share drivers with
 * OPB/PLB, we make it a bus space backend. Each platform ("design", "board")
 * has to provide the leaf _read_4/_write_4 routines specific to device
 * instances. This is dictated by the fact that DCR can only by accessed
 * by m{f,t}dcr instructions for which the address is encoded as immediate
 * operand (and hence needs to be a compile-time constant).
 *
 * The flexibility is well worth the price of one indirection (and a sum
 * and a branch), critical paths can still be implemented with m{f,t}dcr().
