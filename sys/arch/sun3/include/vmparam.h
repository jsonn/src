 * can not use main memory for page tables.  (All active PTEs
 * must be installed in special translation RAM in the MMU).
 * Therefore, parameters that would normally configure the
 * size of various page tables are irrelevant.  Only things
 * that consume portions of kernel virtual (KV) space matter,
 * and those things should be chosen to conserve KV space.

 * pages against paging and will just swap you out rather than paging you.
 * Note that each process has at least UPAGES+CLSIZE pages which are not
 * paged anyways (this is currently 8+2=10 pages or 5k bytes), so this
 * number just means a swapped in process is given around 25k bytes.
 * Just for fun: current memory prices are 4600$ a megabyte on VAX (4/22/81),
 * so we loan each swapped in process memory worth 100$, or just admit
 * that we don't consider it worthwhile and swap it out to disk which costs
 * $30/mb or about $0.75.
