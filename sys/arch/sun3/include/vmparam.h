 * The time for a process to be blocked before being very swappable.
 * This is a number of seconds which the system takes as being a non-trivial
 * amount of real time.  You probably shouldn't change this;
 * it is used in subtle ways (fractions and multiples of it are, that is, like
 * half of a ``long time'', almost a long time, etc.)
 * It is related to human patience and other factors which don't really
 * change over time.

/*
 * A swapped in process is given a small amount of core without being bothered
 * by the page replacement algorithm.  Basically this says that if you are
 * swapped in you deserve some resources.  We protect the last SAFERSS
 * pages against paging and will just swap you out rather than paging you.
 * Note that each process has at least UPAGES+CLSIZE pages which are not
 * paged anyways (this is currently 8+2=10 pages or 5k bytes), so this
 * number just means a swapped in process is given around 25k bytes.
 * Just for fun: current memory prices are 4600$ a megabyte on VAX (4/22/81),
 * so we loan each swapped in process memory worth 100$, or just admit
 * that we don't consider it worthwhile and swap it out to disk which costs
 * $30/mb or about $0.75.
 * Update: memory prices have changed recently (9/96). At the current    
 * value of $6 per megabyte, we lend each swapped in process memory worth
 * $0.15, or just admit that we don't consider it worthwhile and swap it out
 * to disk which costs $0.20/MB, or just under half a cent.
