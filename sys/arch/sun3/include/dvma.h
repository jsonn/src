 * DVMA (Direct Virtual Memory Access)
 *
 * For the unfamiliar, this is just DMA where the device doing DMA
 * operates in a virtual address space.  The virtual to physical
 * translations are controlled by some sort of I/O MMU, which may
 * be the same used by the CPU (sun3) or not (sun3x).  Usually, the
 * virtual space accessed by DVMA devices is a small sub-range of
 * the CPU virtual space, and that range is known as DVMA space.
