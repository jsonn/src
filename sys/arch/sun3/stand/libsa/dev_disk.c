 * This module implements a "raw device" interface suitable for
 * use by the stand-alone I/O library UFS file-system code, and
 * possibly for direct access (i.e. boot from tape).
 *
 * The implementation is deceptively simple because it uses the
 * drivers provided by the Sun PROM monitor.  Note that only the
 * PROM driver used to load the boot program is available here.
