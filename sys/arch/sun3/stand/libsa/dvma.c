 * The easiest way to deal with the need for DVMA mappings is to
 * create a DVMA alias mapping of the entire address range used by
 * the boot program.  That way, dvma_mapin can just compute the
 * DVMA alias address, and dvma_mapout does nothing.
 *
 * Note that this assumes that standalone programs will do I/O
 * operations only within range (SA_MIN_VA .. SA_MAX_VA) checked.
