	 * For reasons known only to Apple, MAC addresses in the ethernet
	 * PROM are stored in Token Ring (IEEE 802.5) format, that is
	 * with all of the bits in each byte reversed (canonical bit format).
	 * When the address is read out it must be reversed to ethernet format
	 * before use.
	 *
	 * Apple has been assigned OUI's 08:00:07 and 00:a0:40. All onboard
	 * ethernet addresses on 68K machines should be in one of these
	 * two ranges.
	 *
	 * Here is where it gets complicated.
	 *
	 * The PMac 7200, 7500, 8500, and 9500 accidentally had the PROM
	 * written in standard ethernet format. The MacOS accounted for this
	 * in these systems, and did not reverse the bytes. Some other
	 * networking utilities were not so forgiving, and got confused.
	 * "Some" of Apple's Nubus ethernet cards also had their bits
	 * burned in ethernet format.
	 *
	 * Apple petitioned the IEEE and was granted the 00:05:02 (bit reversal
	 * of 00:a0:40) as well. As of OpenTransport 1.1.1, Apple removed
	 * their workaround and now reverses the bits regardless of
	 * what kind of machine it is. So PMac systems and the affected
	 * Nubus cards now use 00:05:02, instead of the 00:a0:40 for which they
	 * were intended.
	 *
	 * See Apple Techinfo article TECHINFO-0020552, "OpenTransport 1.1.1
	 * and MacOS System 7.5.3 FAQ (10/96)" for more details.
