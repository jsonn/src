#define	IF_MAXNUBAMR	10
/*
 * Each interface has structures giving information
 * about UNIBUS resources held by the interface
 * for each send and receive buffer.
 *
 * We hold IF_NUBAMR map registers for datagram data, starting
 * at ifr_mr.  Map register ifr_mr[-1] maps the local network header
 * ending on the page boundary.  Bdp's are reserved for read and for
 * write, given by ifr_bdp.  The prototype of the map register for
 * read and for write is saved in ifr_proto.
 *
 * When write transfers are not full pages on page boundaries we just
 * copy the data into the pages mapped on the UNIBUS and start the
 * transfer.  If a write transfer is of a (1024 byte) page on a page
 * boundary, we swap in UNIBUS pte's to reference the pages, and then
 * remap the initial pages (from ifu_wmap) when the transfer completes.
 *
 * When read transfers give whole pages of data to be input, we
 * allocate page frames from a network page list and trade them
 * with the pages already containing the data, mapping the allocated
 * pages to replace the input pages for the next UNIBUS data input.
