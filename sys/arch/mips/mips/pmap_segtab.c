/*
 *	Manages physical address maps.
 *
 *	In addition to hardware address maps, this
 *	module is called upon to provide software-use-only
 *	maps which may or may not be stored in the same
 *	form as hardware maps.  These pseudo-maps are
 *	used to store intermediate results from copy
 *	operations to and from address spaces.
 *
 *	Since the information managed by this module is
 *	also stored by the logical address mapping module,
 *	this module may throw away valid virtual-to-physical
 *	mappings at almost any time.  However, invalidations
 *	of virtual-to-physical mappings must be done as
 *	requested.
 *
 *	In order to cope with hardware architectures which
 *	make virtual-to-physical map invalidates expensive,
 *	this module may delay invalidate or reduced protection
 *	operations until such time as they are actually
 *	necessary.  This module is given full information as
 *	to which processors are currently using which maps,
 *	and to when physical maps must be made correct.

/* XXX simonb 2002/02/26
 *
 * MIPS3_PLUS is used to conditionally compile the r4k MMU support.
 * This is bogus - for example, some IDT MIPS-II CPUs have r4k style
 * MMUs (and 32-bit ones at that).
 *
 * On the other hand, it's not likely that we'll ever support the R6000
 * (is it?), so maybe that can be an "if MIPS2 or greater" check.
 *
 * Also along these lines are using totally separate functions for
 * r3k-style and r4k-style MMUs and removing all the MIPS_HAS_R4K_MMU
 * checks in the current functions.
 *
 * These warnings probably applies to other files under sys/arch/mips.
