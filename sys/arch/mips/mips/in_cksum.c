/* 
 * ccsum.c - Highly optimized MIPS checksum function.
 * by Jonathan Kay, Computer Systems Lab, UCSD         4/2/93
 *
 * Version 2.0
 * Techniques and credits:
 *   Basic algorithm is 3-instruction inner loop sum by Peter Desnoyers.
 *   Full word-size reading as described in Usenix W'93 paper.
 *   Pipelined latency absoption technique as described in paper.
 *   Unrolling chosen through testing and examination of actual workload.
 *   Rewrite in 'C' without loss of performance suggested by Vernon Schryver.
 *   15% faster than version 1 ("Usenix version").
 *   150% faster than Ultrix 4.2A checksum routine.
 *
 * BSD changes: Jonathan Stone, Stanford Distributed Systems Group, 1997-08-11
 *
 *   re-written for incremental checksumming of BSD mbufs
 *   and byteswap out-of-phase mbuf sums.
