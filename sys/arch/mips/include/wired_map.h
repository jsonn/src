/*
 * Certain machines have peripheral busses which are only accessible
 * using the TLB.
 *
 * For example, certain Alchemy parts place PCI and PCMCIA busses at
 * physical address spaces which are beyond the normal 32-bit range.
 * In order to access these spaces TLB entries mapping 36-bit physical
 * addresses to 32-bit logical addresses must be used.
 *
 * Note that all wired mappings are must be 32 MB aligned.  This is
 * because we use 32 MB mappings in the TLB.  Changing this might get
 * us more effficent use of the address space, but it would greatly
 * complicate the code, and would also probably consume additional TLB
 * entries.
 *
 * Note that within a single 32 MB region, you can have multiple
 * decoders, but they must decode uniquely within the same 32MB of
 * physical address space.
 *
 * BEWARE: The start of KSEG2 (0xC0000000) is used by the NetBSD kernel
 * for context switching and is associated with wired entry 0.  So you
 * cannot use that, as I discovered the hard way.
 *
 * Note also that at the moment this is not supported on the MIPS-I
 * ISA (but it shouldn't need it anyway.)
