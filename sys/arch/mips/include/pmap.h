/*
 * The user address space is 2Gb (0x0 - 0x80000000).
 * User programs are laid out in memory as follows:
 *			address
 *	USRTEXT		0x00001000
 *	USRDATA		USRTEXT + text_size
 *	USRSTACK	0x7FFFFFFF
 *
 * The user address space is mapped using a two level structure where
 * virtual address bits 30..22 are used to index into a segment table which
 * points to a page worth of PTEs (4096 page can hold 1024 PTEs).
 * Bits 21..12 are then used to index a PTE which describes a page within 
 * a segment.
 *
 * The wired entries in the TLB will contain the following:
 *	0-1	(UPAGES)	for curproc user struct and kernel stack.
 *
 * Note: The kernel doesn't use the same data structures as user programs.
 * All the PTE entries are stored in a single array in Sysmap which is
 * dynamically allocated at boot time.
