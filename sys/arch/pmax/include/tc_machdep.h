 *
 *	tc_mb()		read/write memory barrier (any CPU<->memory

 *	tc_wmb()	write memory barrier (any CPU<->memory writes

 *	tc_syncbus()	sync TC bus; make sure CPU writes are
 *			propagated across the TURBOchannel bus.
 *	tc_badaddr()	return non-zero if the given address is invalid.
 *	TC_DENSE_TO_SPARSE()
 *			convert the given physical address in
 *			TURBOchannel dense space to the corresponding
 *			address in TURBOchannel sparse space.
 *	TC_PHYS_TO_UNCACHED()
 *			convert the given system memory physical address
