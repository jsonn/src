/*
 * Physical addresses of baseboard devices and registers on the
 * the DECstation 5100 motherboard (also known as the kn230).
 *
 * The only options on the kn230 are two slots for daughterboards.
 * Each slot can contain an extra four-port dc708x DZ11 clone chip.
 * Most baseborad chips are the same hardware and at the same
 * address as  the DECstation 3100 (kn01), except:
 *
 *	The kn230 has more devices than the 3100, so instead
 *	of hardwiring each device to a CPU interrupt line,
 *	the kn230 provides an interrupt-request  register (ICSR).
 * 	Devices are mapped onto  CPU interrupt lines as below:
 *	    hardint 5:	fpu
 *	    hardint 4:	reset switch
 *	    hardint 3:	memory error (write to nonexistent memory)
 *	    hardint 2:	clock
 *	    hardint 1:	sii, lance
 *	    hardint 0:	baseboard DZ, I/O option cards
 *
 *	the ICSR only indicates which devices are requesting interrupts.
 *	there is no interrupt mask register.
 *
 *	There is no framebuffer, pcc (cursor), colormap or vdac on a 5100.
