The smallnet network loader is meant to be a short term solution for
machines that can't netboot full size kernels until a proper two stage
netboot is available.  It isn't the prettiest code around, but it gets
us out of a bind.


To use, "make" in this directory and then in the the setnetimage
directory:

	make KERNEL=/path/to/nfs/install/kernel kernel

and the resultant smallnet.ecoff is suitable for netbooting.
