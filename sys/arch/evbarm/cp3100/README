"The Certance CP3100 product family provides high-end disk-to-disk-to-tape
(D2D2T) functionality for small-to-medium businesses."

Physically, the CP3100 is designed to fit in a single 5.25" half-height
drive bay. Storage is provided by a removable SATA disk integral to the unit.

To software, the hardware is very similar to the IQ80321 and IQ31244 eval
boards from Intel. As such, we share almost all of their code.

Onboard hardware:

 - IOP321 XScale CPU. Core clock is 600MHz.
 - 256MB SDRAM (not sure if that's true for all)
 - Four-port Intel i31244 SATA controller. One port is connected to the
   internal disk. The remaining three are available on the back-panel.
 - Dual GigE ports on the back panel, using an Intel i82546EB controller.
 - Two Symbios Logic 53c1010 SCSI controllers, one in host mode the other
   in target mode. Both SCSI busses are available on the back panel.
   Note that NetBSD does not support SCSI target mode.
 - 8MB of NOR Flash, containing a fairly vanilla Redboot together with
   a minimal compressed Linux image.
 - Some front-panel LEDS (not yet supported).
 - Serial console.

Power is provided via a standard 4-pin Molex connector (5v/Gnd/Gnd/12v).

The serial console is available on the back-panel "MISC" pins. Looking
at the back-panel, with the Molex power connector at the bottom left,
the MISC connector pin-out is:

             M I S C
        1  3  5  7  9  11
        .  .  .  .  .  .
                       
        .  .  .  .  .  .
        2  4  6  8  10 12

There should be a jumper between pins 11-12. The serial console is
available on pins 8, 9, and 10:

 8  - Gnd
 9  - Tx
 10 - Rx

No TTL-RS232 level conversion is needed. Serial parameters are 115200 8N1.


Getting NetBSD onto the CP3100 is a breeze. Simply break into Redboot by
sending ^C before it loads the Linux kernel. Run "fconfig" to set the
network parameters to suit your set up (and set "Run script" to "false"
while you're in there). Drop "netbsd.bin" onto your TFTP server, and
load it onto the CP3100 using "load -r -b 0x200000 netbsd.bin" followed
by "go".

The IQ80321 version of gzboot works fine with the CP3100, so you can use
Redboot to program a gzboot/kernel image into onboard Flash and have it
boot NetBSD on power-up.
