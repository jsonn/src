how-to install

Filesystem on CF card (or Microdrive) needs a ext2 partition for "hermit".
"hermit" is on-flash kernel loader, and he loads filename of boot/Image on
ext2 partition. You copy netbsd.bin made with netbsd to boot/Image.

Boot on-flash linux and execute following commands.
 # fdisk /dev/hdc
 (create hdc1 of few mega bytes and set type 83)
 # mke2fs -O none /dev/hdc1
 # mount /dev/hdc1 /mnt
 # mkdir /mnt/boot
