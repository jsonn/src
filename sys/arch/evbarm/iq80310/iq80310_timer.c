 * Timer/clock support for the Intel IQ80310.
 *
 * The IQ80310 has a 22-bit reloadable timer implemented in the CPLD.
 * We use it to provide a hardclock interrupt.  There is no RTC on
 * the IQ80310.
 *
 * The timer uses the SPCI clock.  The timer uses the 33MHz clock by
 * reading the SPCI_66EN signal and dividing the clock if necessary.
