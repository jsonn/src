 * Machine-specific functions for PCI autoconfiguration.

 * On PCs, there are two methods of generating PCI configuration cycles.
 * We try to detect the appropriate mechanism for this machine and set
 * up a few function pointers to access the correct method directly.
 *
 * The configuration method can be hard-coded in the config file by
 * using `options PCI_CONF_MODE=N', where `N' is the configuration mode
 * as defined section 3.6.4.1, `Generating Configuration Cycles'.
