 * ISA only has 24-bits of address space.  This means

 * in memory below the 16M boundary.  On DMA reads,
 * DMA happens to the bounce buffers, and is copied into
 * the caller's buffer.  On writes, data is copied into
 * but bounce buffer, and the DMA happens from those
 * pages.  To software using the DMA mapping interface,
 * this looks simply like a data cache.
 *
 * If we have more than 16M of RAM in the system, we may
 * need bounce buffers.  We check and remember that here.
 *
 * There are exceptions, however.  VLB devices can do
 * 32-bit DMA, and indicate that here.
 *
 * ...or, there is an opposite case.  The most segments
 * a transfer will require is (maxxfer / PAGE_SIZE) + 1.  If
 * the caller can't handle that many segments (e.g. the
 * ISA DMA controller), we may have to bounce it as well.
