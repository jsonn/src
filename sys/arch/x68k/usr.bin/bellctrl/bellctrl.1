.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Bellctrl
is used to set various preference options of the opm bell.

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Op
.It Fl b
The b option controls bell volume, pitch and duration.
This option accepts up to three numerical parameters, a preceding
dash(-), or a 'on/off' flag. If no parameters are given,
or the 'on' flag is used, the system defaults will be used.
If the dash or 'off' are given, the bell will be turned off.
If only one numerical paramter is given, the bell volume will be
set to that value, as a percentage of its maximum.
Like wise, the second numerical parameter specifies the bell pitch,
in hertz, and the third numerical parameter specifies the duration
in milliseconds.
.Pp
.It \fBv\fP Ar default
The
.Ar default
argument cause the voice parameter to be reset to the system default.
.Pp
.It Fl v Ar voicefile
The
.Fl v
option sets the voice parameter to given voice parameter file (
.Ar voicefile).
