The config files in this directory are generated by the 'makeconf' script
by combining a '<CONFIG>.in' file with 'GENERIC.in' and asserting a some
preprocessor defines.
If something needs to be changed in 'GENERIC.in' or some of the other '.in'
files, please regenerate the config files and commit them too...

Please commit changes to 'GENERIC.in' and other source files *first*, then
run 'makeconf' and commit the generated files to ensure the 'Created from:'
tags are correct.

Leo.
