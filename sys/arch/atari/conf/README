The config files in this directory are generated by the 'makeconf' script
by combining a '<CONFIG>.in' file with 'GENERIC.in' and asserting a some
preprocessor defines.
If something needs to be changed in 'GENERIC.in' or some of the other '.in'
files, please regenerate the config files and commit them too...
