 * pages against paging and will just swap you out rather than paging you.
 * Note that each process has at least UPAGES+CLSIZE pages which are not
 * paged anyways (this is currently 8+2=10 pages or 5k bytes), so this
 * number just means a swapped in process is given around 25k bytes.
 * Just for fun: current memory prices are 4600$ a megabyte on VAX (4/22/81),
 * so we loan each swapped in process memory worth 100$, or just admit
 * that we don't consider it worthwhile and swap it out to disk which costs
 * $30/mb or about $0.75.
 * Update: memory prices have changed recently (9/96). At the current    
 * value of $6 per megabyte, we lend each swapped in process memory worth
 * $0.15, or just admit that we don't consider it worthwhile and swap it out
 * to disk which costs $0.20/MB, or just under half a cent.
