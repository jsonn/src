/*
 * In our zeal to use the sun3 pmap with as few changes as possible,
 * we pretend that sun2 page table entries work more like their sun3
 * counterparts.  Namely, we pretend that they simply have PG_WRITE
 * and PG_SYSTEM bits, and we use get_pte and set_pte to translate
 * entries between the two styles.  
 *
 * All known valid protections in a real sun2 PTE are given in 
 * (disabled) defines below, and are displayed as bitmaps here:
 *
 * 3 2 2 2 2
 * 0 9 8 7 6   meaning
 * -------------------
 * 1 1 1 0 0   PG_KW => a read/write kernel-only page.
 * 1 0 1 0 0   PG_KR => a read-only kernel-only page.
 * 1 1 1 1 1   PG_UW => a read/write kernel/user page.
 * 1 0 1 1 0   PG_URKR => a read-only kernel/user page.
 *
 * The sun3 PTE protections we want to emulate are:
 *
 * PG_SYSTEM | PG_WRITE => a read/write kernel-only page.
 * PG_SYSTEM            => a read-only kernel-only page.
 *             PG_WRITE => a read/write kernel/user page.
 *                      => a read-only kernel/user page.
 * 
 * We want to assign values to PG_SYSTEM and PG_WRITE, and
 * craft get_pte and set_pte to do a translation from and to the real
 * hardware protections.
 *
 * We begin by noting that bits 30 and 28 are set in all known valid
 * sun2 protections.  Since we assume that the kernel can always read
 * all pages in the system, we might as well call one of them the
 * "kernel readable" bit, and say that the other is just always on.
 * We deem bit 30 the "kernel readable" bit.  There is some evidence
 * that bit 28 may mean "not a device" (the PROM makes PTEs for its
 * device mappings with bit 28 clear), but I'm not sure enough about
 * this to do anything about it.  So, set_pte will always set these
 * bits when it loads a valid PTE, and get_pte will always clear them
 * when it unloads a valid PTE.
 *
 * Bit 25, which SunOS calles the "fill on demand" bit, also needs
 * to be set on all valid PTEs.  Dunno any more about this bit.
 *
 * Next, we see that bit 27 is set for all pages the user can access,
 * and clear otherwise.  This bit has the opposite meaning of the sun3
 * PG_SYSTEM bit, but that's OK - we will just define PG_SYSTEM to be
 * bit 27, and set_pte and get_pte will invert it when loading or
 * unloading a valid PTE.
 * 
 * Bit 29 is set for all pages the kernel can write to.  We define
 * PG_WRITE to be bit 29.  No inverting is done.
 *
 * That leaves us to take care of bit 26.  This bit, and bit 27, need
 * to be set for all pages the user can write to.  On the sun3, all
 * user-accessible pages that the kernel can write to, the user can
 * also write to.  We can use this fact to make set_pte set bit 26 iff
 * the kernel can write to the page (PG_WRITE is set), and the user
 * can also access the page (bit 27 is set, i.e., PG_SYSTEM was clear
 * before set_pte inverted it).
 *
 * This is what makes set_pte tricky.  It begins by clearing bit 26
 * (this is paranoia, if all is working well, this bit should never be
 * set in our pseudo-sun3 PTEs).  It then flips PG_SYSTEM to become
 * the user-accessible bit.  Lastly, as the tricky part, it sets bits
 * 30 and 28, *and* sets bit 26 by shifting the expression (pte &
 * PG_WRITE) right by two to move the resulting "single bit" into the
 * bit 27 position, ANDing that with bit 27 in the PTE (the
 * user-accessible bit), shifting that right once more to line up with
 * the target bit 26 in the PTE, and ORing it in.  This will result in
 * bit 26 being set if the pseudo-sun3 protection was simply PG_WRITE.
 *
 * This could be expressed with if .. else.. logic, but the bit
 * shifts should compile into something that needs no branching.
 *
 * get_pte's job is easier.  All it has to do is clear the always-set
 * bits 30, 28, and 25, *and* clear bit 26, and flip PG_SYSTEM.  It can
 * clear bit 26 because the value that was there can always be derived
 * from the resulting pseudo-sun3 PG_SYSTEM and PG_WRITE combination.
 *
 * And that's how we reuse the sun3 pmap.

/*
 * At first glance, the need for two page types for the VME
 * bus on the sun2 isn't obvious - it's a single 16 bit wide
 * bus with 24 address lines, with the A16 devices simply
 * found starting at addresses 0xff0000.  No problem - use
 * only one page type.  But the sun2 VM page frame is only 12 
 * bits wide, with 11 bit wide page offsets, meaning only 23 
 * address bits, not enough to cover the entire VME bus.  So
 * we have two page types, with the low bit of the page type
 * representing the 24th VME bus address bit.
