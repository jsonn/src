 * are together called the bootblocks, and take up the first BBSIZE
 * bytes of the disk.  In 4.2BSD, BBSIZE was 8192 and the disk device
 * block size was 512 bytes (see the definition of SUNND_BSIZE below),
 * making the number of blocks taken up by the bootblocks (BBSIZE /
 * SUNND_BSIZE).  This value for FIRSTBLOCKNUM assumes that the
 * second-stage boot begins immediately after the bootblocks.  The
 * second-stage boot always runs contiguously for MAXBLOCKNUM blocks.
 * FIRSTBLOCKNUM can be increased, and MAXBLOCKNUM can be adjusted, as
 * long as they match up with however you're putting together the disk
