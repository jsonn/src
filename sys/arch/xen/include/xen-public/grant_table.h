/***********************************
 * GRANT TABLE REPRESENTATION
 */

/* Some rough guidelines on accessing and updating grant-table entries
 * in a concurrency-safe manner. For more information, Linux contains a
 * reference implementation for guest OSes (arch/xen/kernel/grant_table.c).
 * 
 * NB. WMB is a no-op on current-generation x86 processors. However, a
 *     compiler barrier will still be required.
 * 
 * Introducing a valid entry into the grant table:
 *  1. Write ent->domid.
 *  2. Write ent->frame:
 *      GTF_permit_access:   Frame to which access is permitted.
 *      GTF_accept_transfer: Pseudo-phys frame slot being filled by new
 *                           frame, or zero if none.
 *  3. Write memory barrier (WMB).
 *  4. Write ent->flags, inc. valid type.
 * 
 * Invalidating an unused GTF_permit_access entry:
 *  1. flags = ent->flags.
 *  2. Observe that !(flags & (GTF_reading|GTF_writing)).
 *  3. Check result of SMP-safe CMPXCHG(&ent->flags, flags, 0).
 *  NB. No need for WMB as reuse of entry is control-dependent on success of
 *      step 3, and all architectures guarantee ordering of ctrl-dep writes.
 *
 * Invalidating an in-use GTF_permit_access entry:
 *  This cannot be done directly. Request assistance from the domain controller
 *  which can set a timeout on the use of a grant entry and take necessary
 *  action. (NB. This is not yet implemented!).
 * 
 * Invalidating an unused GTF_accept_transfer entry:
 *  1. flags = ent->flags.
 *  2. Observe that !(flags & GTF_transfer_committed). [*]
 *  3. Check result of SMP-safe CMPXCHG(&ent->flags, flags, 0).
 *  NB. No need for WMB as reuse of entry is control-dependent on success of
 *      step 3, and all architectures guarantee ordering of ctrl-dep writes.
 *  [*] If GTF_transfer_committed is set then the grant entry is 'committed'.
 *      The guest must /not/ modify the grant entry until the address of the
 *      transferred frame is written. It is safe for the guest to spin waiting
 *      for this to occur (detect by observing GTF_transfer_completed in
 *      ent->flags).
 *
 * Invalidating a committed GTF_accept_transfer entry:
 *  1. Wait for (ent->flags & GTF_transfer_completed).
 *
 * Changing a GTF_permit_access from writable to read-only:
 *  Use SMP-safe CMPXCHG to set GTF_readonly, while checking !GTF_writing.
 * 
 * Changing a GTF_permit_access from read-only to writable:
 *  Use SMP-safe bit-setting instruction.
