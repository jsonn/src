 * MMU-UPDATE REQUESTS
 * 
 * HYPERVISOR_mmu_update() accepts a list of (ptr, val) pairs.
 * ptr[1:0] specifies the appropriate MMU_* command.
 * 
 * FOREIGN DOMAIN (FD)
 * -------------------
 *  Some commands recognise an explicitly-declared foreign domain,
 *  in which case they will operate with respect to the foreigner rather than
 *  the calling domain. Where the FD has some effect, it is described below.
 * 
 * ptr[1:0] == MMU_NORMAL_PT_UPDATE:
 * Updates an entry in a page table. If updating an L1 table, and the new
 * table entry is valid/present, the mapped frame must belong to the FD, if
 * an FD has been specified. If attempting to map an I/O page then the
 * caller assumes the privilege of the FD.
 * FD == DOMID_IO: Permit /only/ I/O mappings, at the priv level of the caller.
 * FD == DOMID_XEN: Map restricted areas of Xen's heap space.
 * ptr[:2]  -- Machine address of the page-table entry to modify.
 * val      -- Value to write.
 * 
 * ptr[1:0] == MMU_MACHPHYS_UPDATE:
 * Updates an entry in the machine->pseudo-physical mapping table.
 * ptr[:2]  -- Machine address within the frame whose mapping to modify.
 *             The frame must belong to the FD, if one is specified.
 * val      -- Value to write into the mapping entry.
 *  
 * ptr[1:0] == MMU_EXTENDED_COMMAND:
 * val[7:0] -- MMUEXT_* command.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_(UN)PIN_*_TABLE:
 *   ptr[:2]  -- Machine address of frame to be (un)pinned as a p.t. page.
 *               The frame must belong to the FD, if one is specified.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_NEW_BASEPTR:
 *   ptr[:2]  -- Machine address of new page-table base to install in MMU.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_TLB_FLUSH:
 *   No additional arguments.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_INVLPG:
 *   ptr[:2]  -- Linear address to be flushed from the TLB.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_FLUSH_CACHE:
 *   No additional arguments. Writes back and flushes cache contents.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_SET_LDT:
 *   ptr[:2]  -- Linear address of LDT base (NB. must be page-aligned).
 *   val[:8]  -- Number of entries in LDT.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_TRANSFER_PAGE:
 *   val[31:16] -- Domain to whom page is to be transferred.
 *   (val[15:8],ptr[9:2]) -- 16-bit reference into transferee's grant table.
 *   ptr[:12]  -- Page frame to be reassigned to the FD.
 *                (NB. The frame must currently belong to the calling domain).
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_SET_FOREIGNDOM:
 *   val[31:16] -- Domain to set as the Foreign Domain (FD).
 *                 (NB. DOMID_SELF is not recognised)
 *                 If FD != DOMID_IO then the caller must be privileged.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_CLEAR_FOREIGNDOM:
 *   Clears the FD.
 * 
 *   val[7:0] == MMUEXT_REASSIGN_PAGE:
 *   ptr[:2]  -- A machine address within the page to be reassigned to the FD.
 *               (NB. page must currently belong to the calling domain).

         *     prevent unbounded stack usage. Whatever the purpose, we expect

         *     and so the likelihood of a 'spurious' IPI is suitably small.
         * The mask is read before making an event upcall to the guest: a
         * non-zero mask therefore guarantees that the VCPU will not receive
         * an upcall activation. The mask is cleared when the VCPU requests

     * A domain can have up to 1024 "event channels" on which it can send
     * and receive asynchronous event notifications. There are three classes
     * of event that are delivered by this mechanism:
     *  1. Bi-directional inter- and intra-domain connections. Domains must
     *     arrange out-of-band to set up a connection (usually the setup
     *     is initiated and organised by a privileged third party such as
     *     software running in domain 0).
     *  2. Physical interrupts. A domain with suitable hardware-access
     *     privileges can bind an event-channel port to a physical interrupt
     *     source.
     *  3. Virtual interrupts ('events'). A domain can bind an event-channel
     *     port to a virtual interrupt source, such as the virtual-timer
     *     device or the emergency console.
     * 
     * Event channels are addressed by a "port index" between 0 and 1023.
     * Each channel is associated with two bits of information:
     *  1. PENDING -- notifies the domain that there is a pending notification
     *     to be processed. This bit is cleared by the guest.
     *  2. MASK -- if this bit is clear then a 0->1 transition of PENDING
     *     will cause an asynchronous upcall to be scheduled. This bit is only
     *     updated by the guest. It is read-only within Xen. If a channel
     *     becomes pending while the channel is masked then the 'edge' is lost
     *     (i.e., when the channel is unmasked, the guest must manually handle
     *     pending notifications as no upcall will be scheduled by Xen).
     * 
     * To expedite scanning of pending notifications, any 0->1 pending
     * transition on an unmasked channel causes a corresponding bit in a
     * 32-bit selector to be set. Each bit in the selector covers a 32-bit
     * word in the PENDING bitfield array.
