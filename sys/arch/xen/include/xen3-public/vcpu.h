 *  1. This operation may return, and VCPU_is_up may return false, before the
 *     VCPU stops running (i.e., the command is asynchronous). It is a good
 *     idea to ensure that the VCPU has entered a non-critical loop before
 *     bringing it down. Alternatively, this operation is guaranteed
 *     synchronous if invoked by the VCPU itself.
 *  2. After a VCPU is initialised, there is currently no way to drop all its
 *     references to domain memory. Even a VCPU that is down still holds
 *     memory references via its pagetable base pointer and GDT. It is good
 *     practise to move a VCPU onto an 'idle' or default page table, LDT and
 *     GDT before bringing it down.
