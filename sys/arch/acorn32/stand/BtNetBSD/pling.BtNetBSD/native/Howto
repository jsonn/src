Running unixfs
--------------

NOTE: This version allows writes only to files/dirs with
world write permission.

This directory contains all the files for unixfs.

unixfs_res	unixfs module
Killunixfs	kills the unixfs module
OpenRoot	opens a filer window on the mounted filesystem
Howto		this file.
mountufs	utility to mount partition

There are also several obey files containing commands to mount various
FFS partitions e.g.

wd0a	- first IDE disc partition A (typically /)
wd0e	- first IDE disc partition E (typically /usr)

These obey files use the mountufs utility. Depending on what controller
your IDE discs are attached to you may need to edit these files.

Once a partition has been mounted the obey file OpenRoot can be
use to open a filer window on the mounted partition.

To remove unixfs run the Killunixfs obey file.

The mountufs utility
--------------------

The mountufs utility simplifies the mounting of a harddisc partition
via unixfs. mountufs takes two arguments, the RISCOS filesystem and
the device e.g.

mountufs ADFS wd0a

The mountufs command will lookup the SWI base for the specified
filesystem and will use the unit number and partition from the
device to formulate the correct combined SWI for the unixfs_mount
command.

The unixfs_mount command
------------------------

A partition is mounted using the command unixfs_mount xxxxx where
xxxxx is the combined SWI, drive and partition number in hex
This number can be calculated as follows

SWI base + (drive * 8) + partition

For example partition e on the first IDE disc on the internal IDE
controller (ADFS::4) would be

40240 + (4 * 8) + 4 = 40264


SWI bases

40240	ADFS (Acorn)
41FC0	IDEFS (ICS)
40980	SCSIFS (Various)
4BBC0	ATAFS (Yellowstone)
