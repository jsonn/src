$NetBSD: README,v 1.1.6.2 2002/01/10 19:36:42 thorpej Exp $

Welcome to NetBSD for the Acorn RiscPC/A7000/NC and Imago !

To get this distribution working run `settype' the file `Settype'
to Obey and run this file. It will set all file types in this
directory to the correct RISC OS types. Pity those file types get
lost after retrieving them from the source repository....

To read more about installing the bootloader, read the FBInstall file.

Enjoy your installation !
