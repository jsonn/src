The current bootloader (since 2001) is written in BASIC and is RISC OS
version independent; it even runs on NC's. 

In contrast to the old bootloader, the (new) bootloader is relocating the
kernel itself at 0xf0000000. This address is fixed to support OFW 
machines which feature this start address.
 
The development of a 2nd stage bootloader is a possible extension.
