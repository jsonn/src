	 * From Rink Springer @ FreeBSD:
	 *
	 * Some XBOX loaders, such as Cromwell, have a flaw which cause the
	 * nfe(4) driver to fail attaching to the NIC.
	 *
	 * This is because they leave the NIC running; this will cause the
	 * Nvidia driver to fail as the NIC does not return any sensible
	 * values and thus fails attaching (using an error 0x5, this means
	 * it cannot find a valid PHY)
	 *
	 * We bluntly tell the NIC to stop whatever it's doing; this makes
	 * nfe(4) attach correctly. As the NIC always resides at
	 * 0xfef00000-0xfef003ff on an XBOX, we simply hardcode this address.
