1. add support for "soft" configuration network devices
2. split console driver into kbd/vga/other drivers
4. fd.c: other floppy types, type detection, optional partitions, QIC40/80
6. fd.c: missing controller queue, no unit start, abysmal
8. kbd needs to turn scancodes into keyindexs with state map, then look
   through multinational scan map for foriegn keyboards.
