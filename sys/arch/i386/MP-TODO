TODO list for MP branch (incomplete):

showstoppers for merge back to -current:

 - rewrite interrupt dispatch so that multi-level shared interrupts
are no longer broken.

 - Figure out why things are broken on !MULTIPROCESSOR

 - Sort out cpu feature probes [runs on new cpu], identify_cpu() [runs
on BSP] and cpu initialization [runs on new cpu]; finish banishing
most global variables containing cpu configuration information.

 - figure out why ahc on serverworks fails to find its interrupt.

 - careful code review of all diffs from -current

"would be nice":

 - try out mpbios+ioapic w/o MULTIPROCESSOR

 - implement MI softint API

 - figure out why cpu time accounting screws up bigtime:
