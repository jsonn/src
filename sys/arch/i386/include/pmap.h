/*
 * see pte.h for a description of i386 MMU terminology and hardware
 * interface.
 *
 * a pmap describes a processes' 4GB virtual address space.  this
 * virtual address space can be broken up into 1024 4MB regions which
 * are described by PDEs in the PDP.  the PDEs are defined as follows:
 *
 * (ranges are inclusive -> exclusive, just like vm_map_entry start/end)
 * (the following assumes that KERNBASE is 0xc0000000)
 *
 * PDE#s	VA range		usage
 * 0->766	0x0 -> 0xbfc00000	user address space
 * 767		0xbfc00000->		recursive mapping of PDP (used for
 *			0xc0000000	linear mapping of PTPs)
 * 768->1023	0xc0000000->		kernel address space (constant
 *			0xffc00000	across all pmap's/processes)
 * 1023		0xffc00000->		"alternate" recursive PDP mapping
 *			<end>		(for other pmaps)
 *
 *
 * note: a recursive PDP mapping provides a way to map all the PTEs for
 * a 4GB address space into a linear chunk of virtual memory.  in other
 * words, the PTE for page 0 is the first int mapped into the 4MB recursive
 * area.  the PTE for page 1 is the second int.  the very last int in the
 * 4MB range is the PTE that maps VA 0xfffff000 (the last page in a 4GB
 * address).
 *
 * all pmap's PD's must have the same values in slots 768->1023 so that
 * the kernel is always mapped in every process.  these values are loaded
 * into the PD at pmap creation time.
 *
 * at any one time only one pmap can be active on a processor.  this is
 * the pmap whose PDP is pointed to by processor register %cr3.  this pmap
 * will have all its PTEs mapped into memory at the recursive mapping
 * point (slot #767 as show above).  when the pmap code wants to find the
 * PTE for a virtual address, all it has to do is the following:
 *
 * address of PTE = (767 * 4MB) + (VA / PAGE_SIZE) * sizeof(pt_entry_t)
 *                = 0xbfc00000 + (VA / 4096) * 4
 *
 * what happens if the pmap layer is asked to perform an operation
 * on a pmap that is not the one which is currently active?  in that
 * case we take the PA of the PDP of non-active pmap and put it in
 * slot 1023 of the active pmap.  this causes the non-active pmap's
 * PTEs to get mapped in the final 4MB of the 4GB address space
 * (e.g. starting at 0xffc00000).
 *
 * the following figure shows the effects of the recursive PDP mapping:
 *
 *   PDP (%cr3)
 *   +----+
 *   |   0| -> PTP#0 that maps VA 0x0 -> 0x400000
 *   |    |
 *   |    |
 *   | 767| -> points back to PDP (%cr3) mapping VA 0xbfc00000 -> 0xc0000000
 *   | 768| -> first kernel PTP (maps 0xc0000000 -> 0xc0400000)
 *   |    |
 *   |1023| -> points to alternate pmap's PDP (maps 0xffc00000 -> end)
 *   +----+
 *
 * note that the PDE#767 VA (0xbfc00000) is defined as "PTE_BASE"
 * note that the PDE#1023 VA (0xffc00000) is defined as "APTE_BASE"
 *
 * starting at VA 0xbfc00000 the current active PDP (%cr3) acts as a
 * PTP:
 *
 * PTP#767 == PDP(%cr3) => maps VA 0xbfc00000 -> 0xc0000000
 *   +----+
 *   |   0| -> maps the contents of PTP#0 at VA 0xbfc00000->0xbfc01000
 *   |    |
 *   |    |
 *   | 767| -> maps contents of PTP#767 (the PDP) at VA 0xbfeff000
 *   | 768| -> maps contents of first kernel PTP
 *   |    |
 *   |1023|
 *   +----+
 *
 * note that mapping of the PDP at PTP#767's VA (0xbfeff000) is
 * defined as "PDP_BASE".... within that mapping there are two
 * defines:
 *   "PDP_PDE" (0xbfeffbfc) is the VA of the PDE in the PDP
 *      which points back to itself.
 *   "APDP_PDE" (0xbfeffffc) is the VA of the PDE in the PDP which
 *      establishes the recursive mapping of the alternate pmap.
 *      to set the alternate PDP, one just has to put the correct
 *	PA info in *APDP_PDE.
 *
 * note that in the APTE_BASE space, the APDP appears at VA
 * "APDP_BASE" (0xfffff000).
