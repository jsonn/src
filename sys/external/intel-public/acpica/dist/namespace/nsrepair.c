/*******************************************************************************
 *
 * This module attempts to repair or convert objects returned by the
 * predefined methods to an object type that is expected, as per the ACPI
 * specification. The need for this code is dictated by the many machines that
 * return incorrect types for the standard predefined methods. Performing these
 * conversions here, in one place, eliminates the need for individual ACPI
 * device drivers to do the same. Note: Most of these conversions are different
 * than the internal object conversion routines used for implicit object
 * conversion.
 *
 * The following conversions can be performed as necessary:
 *
 * Integer -> String
 * Integer -> Buffer
 * String  -> Integer
 * String  -> Buffer
 * Buffer  -> Integer
 * Buffer  -> String
 * Buffer  -> Package of Integers
 * Package -> Package of one Package
 *
 * Additional possible repairs:
 *
 * Optional/unnecessary NULL package elements removed
 * Required package elements that are NULL replaced by Integer/String/Buffer
 * Incorrect standalone package wrapped with required outer package
 *
