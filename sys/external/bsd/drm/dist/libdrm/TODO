- Build and install the test apps by default
- Additional API for unified memory manager
  see http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/DriMemoryManagerDesign for proposal
- Any changes needed to enable the XvMC drivers to link against libdrm
- Header cleanup
- Unify libdrm code paths between client and server
  - drmMsg, xf86DrvMsgVerb versus vfprintf
  - drmOpenDevice tries chmod/chown if in server
  - drmOpen{,ByName} tries to load kernel module if in server
  All but the last two should probably be factored out into libdri.
