 * This file defines the interface between layer 1 (physical card hardware)
 * and layer 2 of a passive ISDN card (i.e. a card that does not run it's
 * own ISDN stack in firmware).
 *
 * The layer 2 is represented in all functions by an opaque layer2token type,
 * internally representing the layer 2 struct softc (which is unknown to
 * layer 1).
 * Similarily layer 1 is represented by a layer1token type, typically
 * representing its struct device derived softc pointer. If someone ever
 * creates a multi-bri passive isdn card, it would need to be something
 * else (i.e. pointer to a struct containing the softc pointer and a
 * interface index), so we do not define it as 'struct device *' here.
