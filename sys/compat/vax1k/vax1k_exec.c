 * Exec glue to provide compatibility with older NetBSD vax1k exectuables.
 *
 * Because NetBSD/vax now uses 4k page size, older binaries (that started
 * on an 1k boundary) cannot be mmap'ed. Therefore they are read in 
 * (via vn_rdwr) as OMAGIC binaries and executed. This will use a little
 * bit more memory, but otherwise won't affect the execution speed.
