	 * XXX The following code is evil.
	 *
	 * The OSF/1 mmap() function attempts to map non-fixed entries
	 * near the address that the user specified.  Therefore, for
	 * non-fixed entires we try to find space in the address space
	 * starting at that address.  If the user specified zero, we
	 * start looking at at least NBPG, so that programs can't
	 * accidentally live through deferencing NULL.
	 *
	 * The need for this kludgery is increased by the fact that
	 * the loader data segment is mapped at
	 * (end of user address space) - 1G, MAXDSIZ is 1G, and
	 * the VM system tries allocate non-fixed mappings _AFTER_
	 * (start of data) + MAXDSIZ.  With the loader, of course,
	 * that means that it'll start trying at
	 * (end of user address space), and will never succeed!
	 *
	 * Notes:
	 *
	 * * Though we find space here, if something else (e.g. a second
	 *   thread) were mucking with the address space the mapping
	 *   we found might be used by another mmap(), and this call
	 *   would clobber that region.
	 *
	 * * In general, tricks like this only work for MAP_ANON mappings,
	 *   because of sharing/cache issues.  That's not a problem on
	 *   the Alpha, and though it's not good style to abuse that fact,
	 *   there's little choice.
	 *
	 * * In order for this to be done right, the VM system should
	 *   really try to use the requested 'addr' passed in to mmap()
	 *   as a hint, even if non-fixed.  If it's passed as zero,
	 *   _maybe_ then try (start of data) + MAXDSIZ, or maybe
	 *   provide a better way to avoid the data region altogether.
