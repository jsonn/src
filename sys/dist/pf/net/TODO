+ = done, - = todo

pf specific TODO:
+ use mbuf tags in pf, don't put everything in mbuf like openbsd does.
+ interfaces must be known when loading rules and pf it not enabled
  do this in pfi_initialize - requires ifinit() to be setup.
- create groups like openbsd 3.7 pf (mostly done? -- testing needed)
- implement if_destroy_groups
- implement pf_modulate_sack
- implement bound_iface for NAT rules
- make LKM load/unload work, fix memory leaks if any
- ALTQ, make it work
- anything else?


non-pf specific (but needed for pf) TODO:
+ figure out what to do with ip_icmp.c packet tag
- add gid to uidinfo
