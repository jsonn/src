pf specific:

TODO:
- implement bound_iface for NAT rules
- make filter on gid/pid work
- resolve XXXPF comments

DONE:
+ use mbuf tags in pf, don't put everything in mbuf like openbsd does.
+ interfaces must be known when loading rules and pf is not enabled.
  do this in pfi_initialize, requires ifinit() to be setup.
+ ALTQ, make it work
+ make LKM load/unload work, fix memory leaks if any
+ create groups like openbsd 3.7 pf (still needs testing)


non-pf specific (but needed for pf):

TODO:
- add gid to uidinfo
- add creator pid to socket

DONE:
+ figure out what to do with ip_icmp.c packet tag
