 * device.  Instead of needing a declaration in the kernel
 * configuration, we teach autoconf(9) the availability of the
 * pseudo-device at run time.
 *
 * Once our autoconf(9) structures are committed to the kernel's
 * arrays, we can attach a device.  It is done through config_attach
 * for a real device, but for a pseudo-device it is a bit different
 * and one has to use config_pseudo_attach.
 *
 * And since we want the user to be responsible for creating device,
 * we use the interface cloning mechanism, and advertise our interface
 * to the kernel.

 * Cleaning up is the most critical part of a LKM, since a module is not

 * to be loaded, you'd better link it to the kernel in the first place.
 *
 * The interface cloning mechanism is really simple, with only two void
 * returning functions.  It will always do its job. You should note though
 * that if an instance of tap can't be detached, the module won't
 * unload and you won't be able to create interfaces anymore.
 *
 * We have to make sure the devices really exist, because they can be
 * destroyed through ifconfig, hence the test whether cd_devs[i] is NULL
 * or not.
 *
 * The cd_devs array is somehow the downside of the whole autoconf(9)
 * mechanism, since if you only create 'tap150', you'll get an array of
 * 150 elements which 149 of them are NULL.
