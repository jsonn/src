 * should be supplied.  They are called with the same arguments (cmd is
 * included to allow the use of a single function, ver is included for
 * version matching between modules and the kernel loader for the modules).

 * Since we expect to link in the kernel and add external symbols to
 * the kernel symbol name space in a future version, generally all
 * functions used in the implementation of a particular module should
 * be static unless they are expected to be seen in other modules or
 * to resolve unresolved symbols alread existing in the kernel (the
 * second case is not likely to ever occur).
 *
 * The entry point should return 0 unless it is refusing load (in which
 * case it should return an errno from errno.h).
