Always a lot to do.  :)

o  Learn how loadable devices can configure themselves, like the interrupt,
   dma, probing, attaching, etc.  Then start adding some of those to the
   lkm tree.

o  Test compat and exec modules on more platforms, make necessary MD
   changes to sys/arch/ or sys/compat/ code to make those modules actually
   usable.

o  decide if it is even useful to make ffs into a loadable module.
   [for diskless boots, sure, why not]

o  what about nfs?  Server and client should both be loadable I suppose.
   [good luck...]
