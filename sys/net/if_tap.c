/*
 * sysctl management routines
 * You can set the address of an interface through:
 * net.link.tap.tap<number>
 *
 * Note the consistent use of tap_log in order to use
 * sysctl_teardown at unload time.
 *
 * In the kernel you will find a lot of SYSCTL_SETUP blocks.  Those
 * blocks register a function in a special section of the kernel
 * (called a link set) which is used at init_sysctl() time to cycle
 * through all those functions to create the kernel's sysctl tree.
 *
 * It is not (currently) possible to use link sets in a LKM, so the
 * easiest is to simply call our own setup routine at load time.
 *
 * In the SYSCTL_SETUP blocks you find in the kernel, nodes have the
 * CTLFLAG_PERMANENT flag, meaning they cannot be removed.  Once the
 * whole kernel sysctl tree is built, it is not possible to add any
 * permanent node.
 *
 * It should be noted that we're not saving the sysctlnode pointer
 * we are returned when creating the "tap" node.  That structure
 * cannot be trusted once out of the calling function, as it might
 * get reused.  So we just save the MIB number, and always give the
 * full path starting from the root for later calls to sysctl_createv
 * and sysctl_destroyv.

 * The helper functions make Andrew Brown's interface really

 *
 * As shown as an example in the man page, the first step is to
 * create a copy of the node to have sysctl_lookup work on it.
 *
 * Here, we have more work to do than just a copy, since we have
 * to create the string.  The first step is to collect the actual
 * value of the node, which is a convenient pointer to the softc
 * of the interface.  From there we create the string and use it
 * as the value, but only for the *copy* of the node.
 *
 * Then we let sysctl_lookup do the magic, which consists in
 * setting oldp and newp as required by the operation.  When the
 * value is read, that means that the string will be copied to
 * the user, and when it is written, the new value will be copied
 * over in the addr array.
 *
 * If newp is NULL, the user was reading the value, so we don't
 * have anything else to do.  If a new value was written, we
 * have to check it.
 *
 * If it is incorrect, we can return an error and leave 'node' as
 * it is:  since it is a copy of the actual node, the change will
 * be forgotten.
 *
 * Upon a correct input, we commit the change to the ifnet
