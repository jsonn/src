/*
 * The networking code runs off software interrupts.
 *
 * You can switch into the network by doing splsoftnet() and return by splx().
 * The software interrupt level for the network is higher than the software
 * level for the clock (so you can enter the network in routines called
 * at timeout time).
 *
 * The routine to request a network software interrupt, setsoftnet(),
 * is defined in the machine-specific include files.
 */

/*
 * Each ``pup-level-1'' input queue has a bit in a ``netisr'' status
 * word which is used to de-multiplex a single software
 * interrupt used for scheduling the network code to calls
 * on the lowest level routine of each protocol.
