/*
 * Null Layer vnode routines.
 *
 * (See mount_null(8) for more information.)
 *
 * The layer.h, layer_extern.h, layer_vfs.c, and layer_vnops.c files provide
 * the core implementation of the null file system and most other stacked
 * fs's. The description below refers to the null file system, but the
 * services provided by the layer* files are useful for all layered fs's.
 *
 * The null layer duplicates a portion of the file system
 * name space under a new name.  In this respect, it is
 * similar to the loopback file system.  It differs from
 * the loopback fs in two respects:  it is implemented using
 * a stackable layers techniques, and it's "null-node"s stack above
 * all lower-layer vnodes, not just over directory vnodes.
 *
 * The null layer has two purposes.  First, it serves as a demonstration
 * of layering by proving a layer which does nothing.  (It actually
 * does everything the loopback file system does, which is slightly
 * more than nothing.)  Second, the null layer can serve as a prototype
 * layer.  Since it provides all necessary layer framework,
 * new file system layers can be created very easily be starting
 * with a null layer.
 *
 * The remainder of the man page examines the null layer as a basis
 * for constructing new layers.
 *
 *
 * INSTANTIATING NEW NULL LAYERS
 *
 * New null layers are created with mount_null(8).
 * Mount_null(8) takes two arguments, the pathname
 * of the lower vfs (target-pn) and the pathname where the null
 * layer will appear in the namespace (alias-pn).  After
 * the null layer is put into place, the contents
 * of target-pn subtree will be aliased under alias-pn.
 *
 * It is conceivable that other overlay filesystems will take different
 * parameters. For instance, data migration or access controll layers might
 * only take one pathname which will serve both as the target-pn and
 * alias-pn described above.
 *
 *
 * OPERATION OF A NULL LAYER
 *
 * The null layer is the minimum file system layer,
 * simply bypassing all possible operations to the lower layer
 * for processing there.  The majority of its activity centers
 * on the bypass routine, through which nearly all vnode operations
 * pass.
 *
 * The bypass routine accepts arbitrary vnode operations for
 * handling by the lower layer.  It begins by examing vnode
 * operation arguments and replacing any layered nodes by their
 * lower-layer equivalents.  It then invokes the operation
 * on the lower layer.  Finally, it replaces the layered nodes
 * in the arguments and, if a vnode is return by the operation,
 * stacks a layered node on top of the returned vnode.
 *
 * The bypass routine in this file, layer_bypass(), is suitable for use
 * by many different layered filesystems. It can be used by multiple
 * filesystems simultaneously. Alternatively, a layered fs may provide
 * its own bypass routine, in which case layer_bypass() should be used as
 * a model. For instance, the main functionality provided by umapfs, the user
 * identity mapping file system, is handled by a custom bypass routine.
 *
 * Typically a layered fs registers its selected bypass routine as the
 * default vnode operation in its vnodeopv_entry_desc table. Additionally
 * the filesystem must store the bypass entry point in the layerm_bypass
 * field of struct layer_mount. All other layer routines in this file will
 * use the layerm_bypass routine.
 *
 * Although the bypass routine handles most operations outright, a number
 * of operations are special cased, and handled by the layered fs. One
 * group, layer_setattr, layer_getattr, layer_access, layer_open, and
 * layer_fsync, perform layer-specific manipulation in addition to calling
 * the bypass routine. The other group

 * Although bypass handles most operations, vop_getattr, vop_lock,
 * vop_unlock, vop_inactive, vop_reclaim, and vop_print are not
 * bypassed. Vop_getattr must change the fsid being returned.
 * Vop_lock and vop_unlock must handle any locking for the
 * current vnode as well as pass the lock request down.
 * Vop_inactive and vop_reclaim are not bypassed so that
 * they can handle freeing null-layer specific data. Vop_print
 * is not bypassed to avoid excessive debugging information.
 * Also, certain vnode operations change the locking state within
 * the operation (create, mknod, remove, link, rename, mkdir, rmdir,
 * and symlink). Ideally these operations should not change the
 * lock state, but should be changed to let the caller of the
 * function unlock them. Otherwise all intermediate vnode layers
 * (such as union, umapfs, etc) must catch these functions to do
 * the necessary locking at their layer.
 *
 *
 * INSTANTIATING VNODE STACKS
 *
 * Mounting associates the null layer with a lower layer,
 * effect stacking two VFSes.  Vnode stacks are instead
 * created on demand as files are accessed.
 *
 * The initial mount creates a single vnode stack for the
 * root of the new null layer.  All other vnode stacks
 * are created as a result of vnode operations on
 * this or other null vnode stacks.
 *
 * New vnode stacks come into existence as a result of
 * an operation which returns a vnode.
 * The bypass routine stacks a null-node above the new
 * vnode before returning it to the caller.
 *
 * For example, imagine mounting a null layer with
 * "mount_null /usr/include /dev/layer/null".
 * Changing directory to /dev/layer/null will assign
 * the root null-node (which was created when the null layer was mounted).
 * Now consider opening "sys".  A vop_lookup would be
 * done on the root null-node.  This operation would bypass through
 * to the lower layer which would return a vnode representing
 * the UFS "sys".  layer_bypass then builds a null-node
 * aliasing the UFS "sys" and returns this to the caller.
 * Later operations on the null-node "sys" will repeat this
 * process when constructing other vnode stacks.
 *
 *
 * CREATING OTHER FILE SYSTEM LAYERS
 *
 * One of the easiest ways to construct new file system layers is to make
 * a copy of the null layer, rename all files and variables, and
 * then begin modifing the copy.  Sed can be used to easily rename
 * all variables.
 *
 * The umap layer is an example of a layer descended from the
 * null layer.
 *
 *
 * INVOKING OPERATIONS ON LOWER LAYERS
 *
 * There are two techniques to invoke operations on a lower layer
 * when the operation cannot be completely bypassed.  Each method
 * is appropriate in different situations.  In both cases,
 * it is the responsibility of the aliasing layer to make
 * the operation arguments "correct" for the lower layer
 * by mapping an vnode arguments to the lower layer.
 *
 * The first approach is to call the aliasing layer's bypass routine.
 * This method is most suitable when you wish to invoke the operation
 * currently being handled on the lower layer.  It has the advantage
 * that the bypass routine already must do argument mapping.
 * An example of this is null_getattrs in the null layer.
 *
 * A second approach is to directly invoke vnode operations on
 * the lower layer with the VOP_OPERATIONNAME interface.
 * The advantage of this method is that it is easy to invoke
 * arbitrary operations on the lower layer.  The disadvantage
 * is that vnodes' arguments must be manually mapped.

/*
 * This is the 08-June-99 bypass routine, based on the 10-Apr-92 bypass
 *		routine by John Heidemann.
 *	The new element for this version is that the whole nullfs
 * system gained the concept of locks on the lower node, and locks on
 * our nodes. When returning from a call to the lower layer, we may
 * need to update lock state ONLY on our layer. The LAYERFS_UPPER*LOCK()
 * macros provide this functionality.
 *    The 10-Apr-92 version was optimized for speed, throwing away some
 * safety checks.  It should still always work, but it's not as
 * robust to programmer errors.
 *    Define SAFETY to include some error checking code.
 *
 * In general, we map all vnodes going down and unmap them on the way back.
 *
 * Also, some BSD vnode operations have the side effect of vrele'ing
 * their arguments.  With stacking, the reference counts are held
 * by the upper node, not the lower one, so we must handle these
 * side-effects here.  This is not of concern in Sun-derived systems
 * since there are no such side-effects.
 *
 * New for the 08-June-99 version: we also handle operations which unlock
 * the passed-in node (typically they vput the node).
 *
 * This makes the following assumptions:
 * - only one returned vpp
 * - no INOUT vpp's (Sun's vop_open has one of these)
 * - the vnode operation vector of the first vnode should be used
 *   to determine what implementation of the op should be invoked
 * - all mapped vnodes are of our vnode-type (NEEDSWORK:
 *   problems on rmdir'ing mount points and renaming?)
