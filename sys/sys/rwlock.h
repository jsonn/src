/*
 * The rwlock provides exclusive access when held as a "writer",
 * and shared access when held as a "reader".
 *
 * Machine dependent code must provide the following:
 *
 *	struct krwlock
 *		The actual rwlock structure.  This structure is mostly
 *		opaque to machine-independent code; most access are done
 *		through macros.  However, machine-independent code must
 *		be able to access the following member:
 *
 *			volatile uintptr_t	rw_owner
 *
 *		The rw_owner field is laid out like so:
 *
 *		 N                    4       3        2        1      0
 *		+-------------------------------------------------------+
 *		| owner or read count | unused | wrlock | wrwant | wait |
 *		+-------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 *	RW_RECEIVE(rw)
 *		Receive the lock from the giver (direct-handoff).  This
 *		is the place to do a load fence.
 *
 *	RW_GIVE(rw)
 *		This is the place to do a load/store fence before the
 *		lock is released.
 *
 *
 * If an architecture can be considered 'simple' (no interlock required in
 * the MP case, or no MP) it need only define __HAVE_SIMPLE_RW_LOCKS and
 * provide the following:
 *
 * 	RW_CAS(ptr, old, new)
 *		Perform an atomic "compare and swap" operation and
 *		evaluate to true or false according to the success
 *
 * Otherwise, the following must be defined:
 *
 *	RW_ACQUIRE(rw, old, new)
 *		Perform an atomic "compare and swap" operation and
 *		evaluate to true or false according to the success
 *		of the operation, such that:
 *			if (rw->rw_owner == old) {
 *				rw->rw_owner = new;
 *				return 1;
 *			} else
 *				return 0;
 *		Must be MP/interrupt atomic.
 *
 *	RW_RELEASE(rw, old, new)
 *		As above, but for releasing the lock.  Must be
 *		MP/interrupt atomic.
 *
 *	RW_SET_WAITERS(rw, need_wait, set_wait)
 *		Set the has-waiters indication.  If the needs-waiting
 *		condition becomes false, abort the operation.  Must
 *		be MP/interrupt atomic.
 *
 *	RW_SETDEBUG(rw, dodebug)
 *		Set the debugging boolean flag.  The flag is only used in
 *		the LOCKDEBUG case.  Used by rw_init to initialize a lock.
 *
 *	RW_DEBUG_P(rw)
 *		Evaluate to true if the lock is initialized by RW_SETDEBUG
 *		with dodebug==true.  Only used in the LOCKDEBUG case.
 *
 * Architectures may optionally provide stubs for the following functions to
 * implement the easy (unlocked, no waiters) cases.  If these stubs are
 * provided, __HAVE_RW_STUBS should be defined.
 *
 *	rw_enter()
 *	rw_exit()
