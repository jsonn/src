/*
 * The rwlock provides exclusive access when held as a "writer",
 * and shared access when held as a "reader".
 *
 * Machine dependent code must provide the following:
 *
 *	struct rwlock
 *		The actual rwlock structure.  This structure is mostly
 *		opaque to machine-independent code; most access are done
 *		through macros.  However, machine-independent code must
 *		be able to access the following member:
 *
 *			__volatile unsigned long rwl_owner
 *
 *		The rwl_owner field is laid out like so:
 *
 *		 N                   4 3    2        1       0
 *		+------------------------------------------------+
 *		| owner or read count | | wrlock | wrwant | wait |
 *		+------------------------------------------------+
 *
 *	RWLOCK_INITIALIZER
 *		Static initializer for rwlocks.
 *
 *	RWLOCK_INIT(rwl)
 *		Initialize the rwlock.
 *
 *	RWLOCK_ACQUIRE(rwl, old, new, actual)
 *		Perform an atomic "compare and swap" operation such
 *		that:
 *			if ((actual = rwl->rwl_owner) == old)
 *				rwl->rwl_owner = new;
 *
 *	RWLOCK_RELEASE(rwl, old, new, actual)
 *		As above, but for releasing the lock.
 *
 *	RWLOCK_SET_WAITERS(rwl, need_wait, set_wait)
 *		Set the has-waiters indication.  If the needs-waiting
 *		condition becomes false, abort the operation.
 *		Memory barriers are for the "acquire
 *
 *	RWLOCK_THREAD
 *		Mask if valid thread/count bits.
