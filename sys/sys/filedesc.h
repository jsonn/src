/*
 * This structure is used for the management of descriptors.  It may be
 * shared by multiple processes.
 *
 * A process is initially started out with NDFILE descriptors stored within
 * this structure, selected to be enough for typical applications based on
 * the historical limit of 20 open files (and the usage of descriptors by
 * shells).  If these descriptors are exhausted, a larger descriptor table
 * may be allocated, up to a process' resource limit; the internal arrays
 * are then unused.  The initial expansion is set to NDEXTENT; each time
 * it runs out, it is doubled until the resource limit is reached. NDEXTENT
 * should be selected to be the biggest multiple of OFILESIZE (see below)
 * that will fit in a power-of-two sized piece of memory.
