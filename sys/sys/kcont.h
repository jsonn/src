 * kcont -- Continuation-passing for BSD kernels.
 *
 * This module defines structures that implement a
 * continuation-passing model in C which can be used as a
 * ``callback''-like alternative to using a process context to
 * tsleep() on an object address, waiting for some event or status
 * change on that object.  Since ANSI C provides neither
 * lexically-nested functions nor heap allocation of activation
 * records, we implement a continuation as a struct containing:
 * 1. A function pointer, pointing to the continuation.
 * 2. A object pointer: the object being "slept" upon.
 * 3. An argument pointer: a pointer to private storage containing
 *    other arguments to the continuation function, including any
 *    additional state beyond the "slept-upon" object.
