/*
 * There are 2 types of mutexes:
 *
 *	* Adaptive -- If the lock is already held, the thread attempting
 *	  to acquire the lock determines if the thread that holds it is
 *	  currently running.  If so, it spins, else it sleeps.
 *
 *	* Spin -- These mutexes always spin, and are thus safe to use
 *	  when there is no valid thread context.  These are similar to
 *	  the Mach `simplelock'.  They also block interrupts as specified
 *	  at mutex init time.
 *
 * When adaptive mutexes are held, they are owned by threads.  When
 * Spin mutexes are held, they are owned by CPUs.
 *
 * Machine dependent code must provide the following:
 *
 *	struct mutex
 *		The actual mutex structure.  This structure is mostly
 *		opaque to machine-independent code; most access are done
 *		through macros.  However, machine-independent code must
 *		be able to access the following members:
 *
 *			__cpu_simple_lock_t m_spinlock
 *			int m_oldspl
 *			int m_minspl
 *
 *	MUTEX_INITIALIZER_ADAPTIVE
 *		Static initializer for adaptive mutexes.
 *
 *	MUTEX_INITIALIZER_SPIN(ipl)
 *		Static initializer for spin mutexes.
 *
 *	MUTEX_INIT(mtx, type)
 *		Initialize the machine-dependent mutex fields.
 *
 *	MUTEX_ADAPTIVE_P(mtx)
 *		Evaluates to true if the mutex is an adaptive mutex.
 *
 *	MUTEX_SPIN_P(mtx)
 *		Evaluates to true if the mutex is a spin mutex.
 *
 *	MUTEX_OWNER(mtx)
 *		Returns the owner of the adaptive mutex (struct proc *).
 *
 *	MUTEX_HAS_WAITERS(mtx)
 *		Returns true if the mutex has waiters.
 *
 *	MUTEX_SET_WAITERS(mtx)
 *		Mark the mutex has having waiters.
 *
 *	MUTEX_RELEASE(mtx)
 *		Release the lock and clear the "has waiters" indication.
 *
 *	mutex_enter(kmutex_t *mtx)
 *		Try to acquire the mutex.  If it is held, call
 *		mutex_vector_enter().
 *
 *	mutex_tryenter(kmutex_t *mtx)
 *		Try to acquire the mutex.  If it is held, call
 *		mutex_vector_tryenter().
 *
 *	mutex_exit(kmutex_t *mtx)
 *		Try to release the mutex.  If the owner field is
 *		not the current thread, call mutex_vector_exit().
