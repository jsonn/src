 * The following macros are used to convert from a ucontext to sigcontext,

 * signal handlers, and converting back (in the event the handler modifies
 * the context).
 *
 * The only valid use of these macros is to convert a ucontext to a
 * sigcontext for old-style signal delivery and then back to the same
 * ucontext after the handler has returned.
 *
 * The _MCONTEXT_TO_SIGCONTEXT() and _SIGCONTEXT_TO_MCONTEXT() macros
 * should be provided by <machine/signal.h>.
