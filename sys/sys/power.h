/*
 * Power Switches:
 *
 * Power switches are devices on the system that are used by the system
 * operator to cause certain types of power management events to happen.
 * This may be the closing of a laptop lid, the pressing of a power button,
 * or some other type of user-initiated hardware event.
 *
 * We define the following types of power switches:
 *
 *	Power button		This is the "on/off" button on a system,
 *				or another button which provides a similar
 *				function.  If there is no power management
 *				daemon present, an event on this button will
 *				cause a semi-graceful shutdown of the system
 *				to occur.  This kind of button doesn't keep
 *				state; we only know (care) if an event occurs.
 *
 *	Reset button		This is the "reset" button on a system, or
 *				another button which provides a similar
 *				function.  If there is no power management
 *				daemon present, an event on this button will
 *				cause a semi-graceful reboot of the system
 *				to occur.  This kind of button doesn't keep
 *				state; we only know (care) if an event occurs.
 *
 *	Sleep button		This is a button which is dedicated to a
 *				"sleep" function.  This kind of button doesn't
 *				keep state; we only know (care) if an event
 *				occurs.
 *
 *	Lid switch		This is e.g. the lid of a laptop.  This kind
 *				of switch has state.  We know if it is open
 *				or closed.
