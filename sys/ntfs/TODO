NTFS - list of things to do in no particular order:

- handle Unicode chars more inteligently - currently only iso-8859-1
  chars are supported, it should be possible to get the filename
  converted into koi-8, iso-8859-2 & utf-8 at least - there is
  some Unicode support present under FreeBSD, would be worth considering
  for adoption (it's needed to properly support Juliet CDs anyway)

  * not very hard

- better support for writing; tricky is crash recovery

- cleanup the mess with several *readattr*() functions if possible

- convert the code to do caching in buffer cache indexed by
  file-vnode/file-offset so that NTFS would take advantage of UBC;
  it should also improve performance somewhat, because if it's necessary
  to find some offset in a file, it's possible to check if the data
  are available in the cache before doing the bmap operation first

- working VOP_BALLOC() (new in UBC)
	(from Chuq)

- implement writing into resident attributes, so it would be possible
   to write into "small" files (<30KB) too
	(from Semen Ustimenko <semenu@FreeBSD.org>)

- support mount update

- really implement sync

- write necessary bits to support NTFS in libsa

- ntfs_nt{get|put|rele}() - investigate if they are really necessary;
	if not, drop them if yes, convert them to use lockmgr()-style locking
