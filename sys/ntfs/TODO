$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.12.2.1 2000/11/20 18:11:23 bouyer Exp $

- Windows 2000 NTFS support

- basic sysinst support for NTFS

- handle Unicode chars more inteligently - currently only iso-8859-1
  chars are supported, it should be possible to get the filename
  converted into koi-8, iso-8859-2 & utf-8 at least - there is a set
  of patches for FreeBSD adding Unicode support for Joliet CDs worth
  adopting:
  	http://triaez.kaisei.org/~mzaki/joliet/
  [almost done]

- better support for writing; tricky is crash recovery

- cleanup the mess with several *readattr*() functions if possible

- convert the code to do caching in buffer cache indexed by
  file-vnode/file-offset so that NTFS would take advantage of UBC;
  it should also improve performance somewhat, because if it's necessary
  to find some offset in a file, it's possible to check if the data
  are available in the cache before doing the bmap operation first
	(from Chuq)

- working VOP_BALLOC() (new in UBC)
	(from Chuq)

- implement writing into resident attributes, so it would be possible
   to write into "small" files (<30KB) too
	(from Semen Ustimenko <semenu@FreeBSD.org>)

- support mount update

- really implement sync

- write necessary bits to support NTFS in libsa

- NTFS ACL support (though usefullness of such feature is arguable)
