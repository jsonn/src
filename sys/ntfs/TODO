- convert the code to do caching in buffer cache indexed by
  file-vnode/file-offset so that NTFS would take advantage of UBC;
  it should also improve performance somewhat, because if it's necessary
  to find some offset in a file, it's possible to check if the data
  are available in the cache before doing the bmap operation first
	(from Chuq)

- working VOP_BALLOC() (new in UBC)
	(from Chuq)

- Windows 2000 NTFS support (need windows 2000 machine to test)

- handle Unicode chars more inteligently - the code now mangles filenames
  to something close to iso-8859-1, the default should be to encode them
  to utf-8 with option to use other character sets like iso-8859-[12], koi-8
  and the like.
  There is a set of patches for FreeBSD adding Unicode support for Joliet CDs
  worth adopting:

- cleanup the mess with several *readattr*() functions if possible

- implement writing into resident attributes, so it would be possible
   to write into "small" files (<30KB) too
	(from Semen Ustimenko <semenu@FreeBSD.org>)
  generally, better write support


- support mount update

- really implement sync

- write necessary bits to support NTFS in libsa

- basic sysinst support for NTFS

- NTFS ACL support (though usefullness of such feature is arguable)
