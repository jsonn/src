# standard MI 'options'
#
# this file is for options which can't be off-by-default for some reasons.
# "it's commonly used" is NOT a good reason to enable options here.

# the following options are on-by-default to keep
# kernel config file compatibility.
options	VMSWAP		# Swap device/file support
options	BUFQ_FCFS	# First-come First-serve strategy
options	BUFQ_DISKSORT	# Traditional min seek sort strategy
