 *	Management of resident (logical) pages.

 *	page, indexed by page number.  Each structure
 *	is an element of several lists:
 *
 *		A hash table bucket used to quickly
 *		perform object/offset lookups
 *
 *		A list of all pages for a given object,
 *		so they can be quickly deactivated at
 *		time of deallocation.
 *
 *		An ordered list of pages due for pageout.
 *
 *	In addition, the structure contains the object
 *	and offset to which this page belongs (for pageout),
 *	and sundry status bits.
 *
 *	Fields in this structure are locked either by the lock on the
 *	object that the page belongs to (O) or by the lock on the page
 *	queues (P) [or both].

 * that is fine for a single threaded uniprocessor OS, but bad if you
 * want to actual make use of locking (simple_lock's).  so, we've
 * seperated things back out again.
