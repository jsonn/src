 * These macros perform sequence number arithmetic modulo (2**7 or 2**31).
 * The relevant fields in the tpcb are: tp_seqmask : the mask of bits that
 * define the sequence space. tp_seqbit  : 1 + tp_seqmask tp_seqhalf :
 * tp_seqbit / 2 or half the sequence space (rounded up) Not exactly fast,
 * but at least it's maintainable.
