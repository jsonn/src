/* 
 * ARGO TP
 *
 * Contains all the timer code.  
 * There are two sources of calls to these routines:
 * the clock, and tp.trans. (ok, and tp_pcb.c calls it at init time)
 *
 * Timers come in two flavors - those that generally get
 * cancelled (tp_ctimeout, tp_cuntimeout)
 * and those that either usually expire (tp_etimeout, 
 * tp_euntimeout, tp_slowtimo) or may require more than one instance
 * of the timer active at a time.
 *
 * The C timers are stored in the tp_ref structure. Their "going off"
 * is manifested by a driver event of the TM_xxx form.
 *
 * The E timers are handled like the generic kernel callouts.
 * Their "going off" is manifested by a function call w/ 3 arguments.
