.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can digitally sign files and verify that the signatures
attached to files were signed by a given user identifier.
.Nm
can also encrypt files using the public or private keys of
users and, in the same manner, decrypt files which were encrypted.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can also be used to generate a new key-pair for a user.
This key is in two parts, the public key (which can be
used by other people) and a private key.
.Pp
In addition to these primary uses, the third way of using
.Nm
is to maintain keyrings.
Keyrings are collections of public keys belonging to other users.
By using other means of identification, it is possible to establish
the bona fides of other users.
Once trust has been established, the public key of the other
user will be signed.
The other user's public key can be added to our keyring.
The other user will add our public key to their keyring.
.Pp
Keys can be listed, exported (i.e. made available to others),
and imported (i.e. users who have signed our public key).
.Pp
One of the following commands must be present:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl Fl clearsign
The signature of the file named on the command line is calculated
in the same manner as the
.Fl Fl sign
command, but the text is added to the file such that
the text itself is not in binary format, but can be read by mere mortals.
.It Fl Fl decrypt
Decrypt the file using the user's private key.
The pass phrase will be optained by prompting the user
to type it in, using
.Xr getpass 3 .
.It Fl Fl encrypt
Use the user's public key to encrypt the files named on the command line.
.It Fl Fl export-key
Display the current public key in a format suitable for export.
This can be used to place the keyring on one of the
public key servers, for example.
.It Fl Fl find-key
Find the appropriate public key from the current keyring.
If no keyring is provided, the user's public keyring is used.
.It Fl Fl generate-key
This command is used to generate a new public and private key pair.
The user id is taken from the command line, and the user will be
prompted to provide a suitable pass phrase.
.It Fl Fl import-key
Import a public key as retrieved from one of the public key servers.
This is in the form of a file which has previously been
retrieved from elsewhere.
.It Fl Fl list-keys
List all the public keys in the current keyring.
If no keyring is provided, the user's public keyring is used.
.It Fl Fl sign
The private key is used to digitally sign the files named on the
command line.
Extra text is added to the file.
In rough terms, this text is a digest of the file's contents,
encrypted with the user's private key.
Since together, the private and public keys identify the user
uniquely, the added text can be used to identify the exact version
of the file, and any changes made to the file will mean that the
signature no longer matches.
The file and its attached signature are created with a
.Dq Pa .gpg
extension to the original file name.
The user will be prompted for their pass phrase using
.Xr getpass 3 .
.It Fl Fl verify
For each of the files named on the command line, the signature of the file
is verified, checking the contents against the user's public signature.
.It Fl Fl version
Print the version information from the
.Xr libnetpgp 3
library.
.El
.Pp
In addition to one of the preceding commands, a number of qualifiers
or options may be given.
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl Fl armour , Fl armor
This option, however it is spelled, wraps the signature as an
ASCII-encoded piece of text, for ease of use.
.It Fl Fl homedir Ar home-directory
Keyrings are normally located, for historical reasons, within
the user's home directory in a subdirectory called
.Dq Pa .gnupg
and this option specifies an alternative location in which to
find that sub-directory.
.It Fl Fl keyring Ar keyring
This option specifies an alternative keyring to be used.
All keyring operations will be relative to this alternative keyring.
.It Fl Fl numbits Ar numbits
specifies the number of bits to be used when generating a key.
The default number of bits is 2048.
This is considered the absolute
minimum which should be chosen at the time of writing (2009).
Due to advances in computing power every year, this number should
be reviewed, and increased when it becomes easier to factor 2048
bit numbers.
.It Fl Fl userid Ar userid
This option specifies the user identity to be used for all operations.
This identity can either be in the form of the full name, or as an
email address.
Care should be exercised with these ways of specifying the user identity,
since the
.Nm
utility has no way of verifying that an email address is valid, or
that a key belongs to a certain individual.
The trust for a signed key is given by the other signers of that key.
The 16 hexadecimal digit user identity should be used when specifying
user identities - email addresses and names are provided as aliases.
.El
.Sh PASS PHRASES
The pass phrase cannot be changed once it has been chosen, and will
be used for the life of the key, so a wise choice is advised.
The pass phrase should not be an easily guessable word or phrase,
or related to information that can be gained through
.Dq social engineering
using search engines, or other public information retrieval methods.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility includes an option to provide the pass phrase as a command
line option.
The use of this option is strongly discouraged, since it could
lead to involuntary information disclosure.
.Xr getpass 3
will be used to obtain the pass phrase from the user if it is
needed,
such as during signing or encryption, or key generation,
so that any secret information cannot be viewed by other users
using the
.Xr ps 1
or
.Xr top 1
commands, or by looking over the shoulder at the screen.
.Pp
Since the public and private key pair can be used to verify
a person's identity, and since identity theft can have
far-reaching consequences, users are strongly encouraged to
enter their pass phrases only when prompted by the application.
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl passphrase
option is deprecated, and will be removed in future versions
of the tool.
.Sh SIGNING AND VERIFICATION
Signing and verification of a file is best viewed using the following example:
.Bd -literal

.Ed
.Pp
In the example above, a signature is made on a single file called
.Dq a
using a user identity corresponding to
.Dq agc@netbsd.org
The key located for the user identity is displayed, and
the user is prompted to type in their passphrase.
The resulting file, called
.Dq a.gpg
is placed in the same directory.
The second part of the example shows a verification of the signed file
taking place.
The time and user identity of the signatory is displayed, followed
by a fuller description of the public key of the signatory.
In both cases, the exit value from the utility was a successful one.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
utility will return 0 for success,
1 if the file's signature does not match what was expected,
or 2 if any other error occurs.
