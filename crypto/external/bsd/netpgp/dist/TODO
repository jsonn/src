To Do
=====
need a netpgp_set_{pub,sec}key()? vs _init()?
default compression when signing
get rid of ops_memory after used literal_data_body
sort out callback - ops_export_key, packet-parse callback etc
Simplify IO
Make into SHA1Init, SHA1End, SHA1File style of calls
Work out a way to get text out of a signed file
Multiple recipients for encryption
Look at inefficiencies - read() etc

Done
====
autoconf
libtool
name change
content_ naming scheme
Brief test script
get rid of C global
put all readers and writers together in one file
Add mmapped method
merge mmap'ed and fd reads - if mmap fails, fall back to read
Make sure all openpgpsdk changes are brought forward
look at header file fun
new version number in autoconf
Make decrypt work with files > 8192 bytes
dynamically size literal_data_body before decompressing?
restore ops_export_key functionality
match keyids using case insensitive matching - (c0596823 == C0596823)
use PRIsize appropriately
make a high-level interface
get rid of multiple local headers
get rid of long identifier names - all done internally now
Finish name change for everything
work out what's exported and what's not
finish off main header file
init(&netpgp, userid, pubring, secring)
__ops
real naming scheme
get rid of malloc() instances -> calloc()
change include directory
Install man pages
