IPsec-tools
===========

This package provides a way to use the native IPsec functionality 
in the Linux 2.6+ kernel. It works as well on NetBSD and FreeBSD.

	- libipsec, a PF_KEYv2 library
	- setkey, a tool to directly manipulate policies and SAs
	- racoon, an IKEv1 keying daemon

IPsec-tools were ported to Linux from the KAME project 
(http://www.kame.net) by Derek Atkins  <derek@ihtfp.com>.

Currently the package is actively maintained and developed 
by Michal Ludvig <mludvig@suse.cz>, Aidas Kasparas <a.kasparas@gmc.lt>
Emmanuel Dreyfus <manu@netbsd.org>, VANHULLEBUS Yvan <vanhu@zeninc.net>,
and Fred Senault <fred.letter@lacave.net>.
