# To trigger the SA negotiation there must be an appropriate

# networks 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24 with gateways 
# 172.16.0.1 and 172.16.1.1, where the first gateway is behind 
# a NAT which translates its address to 172.16.1.3, you need the 
# following rules:
# On 172.16.0.1 (e.g. behind the NAT):
#     spdadd 192.168.0.0/24 192.168.1.0/24 any -P out ipsec \
#            esp/tunnel/172.16.0.1-172.16.1.1/require;
#     spdadd 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.0.0/24 any -P in ipsec \
#            esp/tunnel/172.16.1.1-172.16.0.1/require;
# On the other side (172.16.1.1) either use a "generate_policy on"
# statement in the remote block, or in case that you know 
# the translated address, use the following policy:
#     spdadd 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.0.0/24 any -P out ipsec \
#            esp/tunnel/172.16.1.1-172.16.1.3/require;
#     spdadd 192.168.0.0/24 192.168.1.0/24 any -P in ipsec \
#            esp/tunnel/172.16.1.3-172.16.1.1/require;
