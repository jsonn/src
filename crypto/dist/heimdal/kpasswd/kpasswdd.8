.Sh NAME
.Nm kpasswdd
.Nd
Kerberos 5 password changing server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -check-library= Ns Ar library
.Op Fl -check-function= Ns Ar function
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
serves request for password changes. It listens on UDP port 464
(service kpasswd) and processes requests when they arrive. It changes
the database directly and should thus only run on the master KDC.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Fl -check-library= Ns Ar library
.Xc
If your system has support for dynamic loading of shared libraries,
you can use an external function to check password quality. This
option specifies which library to load.
.It Xo
.Fl -check-function= Ns Ar function
.Xc
This is the function to call in the loaded library. The function
should look like this:
.Pp
.Ft const char *
.Fn passwd_check "krb5_context context" "krb5_principal principal" "krb5_data *password"
.Pp
.Fa context
is an initialized context;
.Fa principal
is the one who tries to change passwords, and
.Fa password
is the new password. Note that the password (in
.Fa password->data )
is not zero terminated.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If an error occurs, the error message is returned to the user and/or
logged to syslog.
.Sh BUGS
The default password quality checks are too basic.
