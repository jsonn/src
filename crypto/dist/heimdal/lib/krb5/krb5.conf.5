Configuration file for Kerberos 5
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
file specifies several configuration parameters for the Kerberos 5
library, as well as for some programs.
.Pp
The file consists of one or more sections, containing a number of
bindings. The value of each binding can be either a string or a list
of other bindings. The grammar looks like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
file:
	/* empty */
	sections

sections:
	section sections
	section

section:
	'[' section_name ']' bindings

section_name:
	STRING

bindings:
	binding bindings
	binding

binding:
	name '=' STRING
	name '=' '{' bindings '}'

name:
	STRING

.Ed
.Li STRINGs
consists of one or more non-white space characters.
Currently recognised sections and bindings are:
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Li [libdefaults]
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Li default_realm = Va REALM
Default realm to use, this is also known as your 
.Dq local realm .
The default is the result of
.Fn krb5_get_host_realm "local hostname" .
.It Li clockskew = Va time
Maximum time differential (in seconds) allowed when comparing
times. Default is 300 seconds (five minutes).
.It Li kdc_timeout = Va time
Maximum time to wait for a reply from the kdc, default is 3 seconds.
.It v4_name_convert
.It v4_instance_resolve
These are decribed in the 
.Xr krb5_425_conv_principal  3
manual page.
.It Li capath = {
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Va destination-realm Li = Va next-hop-realm
.It ...
.El
Normally, all requests to realms different from the one of the current
client are sent to this KDC to get cross-realm tickets.
If this KDC does not have a cross-realm key with the desired realm and
the hierarchical path to that realm does not work, a path can be
configured using this directive.
The text shown above instructs the KDC to try to obtain a cross-realm
ticket to
.Va next-hop-realm
when the desired realm is
.Va destination-realm .
This configuration should preferably be done on the KDC where it will
help all its clients but can also be done on the client itself.
.It Li }
.It Li default_etypes = Va etypes...
A list of default etypes to use.
.It Li default_etypes_des = Va etypes...
A list of default etypes to use when requesting a DES credential.
.It Li default_keytab_name = Va keytab

.Dq FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab .
.It Li kdc_timesync = Va boolean

and the KDC, and then compensate for that when issuing requests.

perid.

.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Va REALM Li = {
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Li kdc = Va host[:port]

.It Li admin_server = Va host[:port]
Specifies the admin server for this realm, where all the modifications
to the database are perfomed.

try to parse it as a sequence of
.Va etype:salttype:salt
syntax of this if something like:
.Pp
[(des|des3|etype):](pw-salt|afs3-salt)[:string]
.Pp
if
.Ar etype
is omitted it means everything, and if string is omitted is means the default string (for that principal). Additional special values of keyttypes are:
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It v5 
The kerberos 5 salt
.Va pw-salt
.It v4
The kerberos 4 type
.Va des:pw-salt:
.El
.It use_v4_salt = Va BOOL
When true, this is the same as
.Pp
.Va default_keys = Va des3:pw-salt Va v4
.Pp

.Ev KRB5_CONFIG

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Since
.Nm
is read and parsed by the krb5 library, there is not a lot of
opportunities for programs to report parsing errors in any useful
format.
To help overcome this problem, there is a program
.Nm verify_krb5_conf
that reads
.Nm
and tries to emit useful diagnostics from parsing errors.  Note that
this program does not have any way of knowing what options are
actually used and thus cannot warn about unknown or misspelt ones.
