  release. For more details please read the CHANGES file.

  Major changes between OpenSSL 0.9.5 and OpenSSL 0.9.5a:

      o Bug fixes for Win32, SuSE Linux, NeXTSTEP and FreeBSD 2.2.8 
      o Shared library support for HPUX and Solaris-gcc
      o Support of Linux/IA64
      o Assembler support for Mingw32
      o New 'rand' application
      o New way to check for existence of algorithms from scripts

  Major changes between OpenSSL 0.9.4 and OpenSSL 0.9.5:

      o S/MIME support in new 'smime' command
      o Documentation for the OpenSSL command line application
      o Automation of 'req' application
      o Fixes to make s_client, s_server work under Windows
      o Support for multiple fieldnames in SPKACs
      o New SPKAC command line utilty and associated library functions
      o Options to allow passwords to be obtained from various sources
      o New public key PEM format and options to handle it
      o Many other fixes and enhancements to command line utilities
      o Usable certificate chain verification
      o Certificate purpose checking
      o Certificate trust settings
      o Support of authority information access extension
      o Extensions in certificate requests
      o Simplified X509 name and attribute routines
      o Initial (incomplete) support for international character sets
      o New DH_METHOD, DSA_METHOD and enhanced RSA_METHOD
      o Read only memory BIOs and simplified creation function
      o TLS/SSL protocol bugfixes: Accept TLS 'client hello' in SSL 3.0
        record; allow fragmentation and interleaving of handshake and other
        data
      o TLS/SSL code now "tolerates" MS SGC
      o Work around for Netscape client certificate hang bug
      o RSA_NULL option that removes RSA patent code but keeps other
        RSA functionality
      o Memory leak detection now allows applications to add extra information
        via a per-thread stack
      o PRNG robustness improved
      o EGD support
      o BIGNUM library bug fixes
      o Faster DSA parameter generation
      o Enhanced support for Alpha Linux
      o Experimental MacOS support

  Major changes between OpenSSL 0.9.3 and OpenSSL 0.9.4:

      o Transparent support for PKCS#8 format private keys: these are used
        by several software packages and are more secure than the standard
        form
      o PKCS#5 v2.0 implementation
      o Password callbacks have a new void * argument for application data
      o Avoid various memory leaks
      o New pipe-like BIO that allows using the SSL library when actual I/O
        must be handled by the application (BIO pair)

  Major changes between OpenSSL 0.9.2b and OpenSSL 0.9.3:
      o Lots of enhancements and cleanups to the Configuration mechanism
      o RSA OEAP related fixes
      o Added `openssl ca -revoke' option for revoking a certificate
      o Source cleanups: const correctness, type-safe stacks and ASN.1 SETs
      o Source tree cleanups: removed lots of obsolete files
      o Thawte SXNet, certificate policies and CRL distribution points
        extension support
      o Preliminary (experimental) S/MIME support
      o Support for ASN.1 UTF8String and VisibleString
      o Full integration of PKCS#12 code
      o Sparc assembler bignum implementation, optimized hash functions
      o Option to disable selected ciphers

  Major changes between OpenSSL 0.9.1c and OpenSSL 0.9.2b:
      o Fixed a security hole related to session resumption
      o Fixed RSA encryption routines for the p < q case
      o "ALL" in cipher lists now means "everything except NULL ciphers"
      o Support for Triple-DES CBCM cipher
      o Support of Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) for RSA
      o First support for new TLSv1 ciphers
      o Added a few new BIOs (syslog BIO, reliable BIO)
      o Extended support for DSA certificate/keys.
      o Extended support for Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)
      o Initial support for X.509v3 extensions
      o Extended support for compression inside the SSL record layer
      o Overhauled Win32 builds
      o Cleanups and fixes to the Big Number (BN) library
      o Support for ASN.1 GeneralizedTime
      o Splitted ASN.1 SETs from SEQUENCEs
      o ASN1 and PEM support for Netscape Certificate Sequences
      o Overhauled Perl interface
      o Lots of source tree cleanups.
