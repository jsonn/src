* New option `-w' to rxtelnet, rxterm.

Major changes in release 0.9.5:

* We made some changes to be compatible with the other kerberised ftp
  implementations and this means that an old kerberised ftp client will
  not be able to talk to a new ftp server.  So try to upgrade your ftp
  clients and servers at the same time.  The reason for this change is
  described in more detail below.

* The interpretation of /etc/ftpusers has changed slightly, see
  ftpusers(5). These changes come from NetBSD.

* The function `des_quad_cksum', which is used by `krb_rd_safe', and
  `krb_mk_safe', has never been compatible with MIT's DES
  library. This has now been fixed.

  This fix will however break some programs that used those functions,
  for instance `ftp'. In this version `krb_rd_safe' is modified to
  accept checksums of both the new and the old format; `krb_mk_safe'
  will always emit checksums of the new type *unless* `krb_rd_safe'
  has detected that the client is using the old checksum (this feature
  may be removed in some future release).

  If you have programs that use `krb_mk_safe' and `krb_rd_safe' you
  should upgrade all clients before upgrading your servers. Client is
  here defined as the program that first calls `krb_rd_safe'.

  If you are using some protocol that talks to more than one client or
  server in one session, the heuristics to detect which kind of
  checksum to use might fail.

  The problem with `des_quad_cksum' was just a byte-order problem, so
  there are no security problems with using the old versions. Thanks
  to Derrick J Brashear <shadow@DEMENTIA.ORG> for pointing in the
  right general direction.

* Rewrote kx to work always open TCP connections in the same
  direction.  This was needed to make it work through NATs and is
  generally a cleaner way of doing it.  Also added `tenletxr'.
  Unfortunately the new protocol is not compatible with the old one.
  The new kx and kxd programs try to figure out if they are talking to
  old versions.

* Quite a bit of new functionality in otp.  Changed default hash
  function to `md5'.  Fixed implementation of SHA and added downcasing
  of seed to conform with `draft-ietf-otp-01.txt'.  All verification
  examples in the draft now work.

* Fixed buffer overflows.

* Add history/line editing in kadmin and ftp.

* utmp/utmpx and wtmp/wtmpx might work better on strange machines.

* Bug fixes for `rsh -n' and `rcp -x'.

* reget now works in ftp and ftpd.  Passive mode works.  Other minor
  bug fixes as well.

* New option `-g umask' to ftpd for specifying the umask for anonymous users.

* Fix for `-l' option in rxtelnet and rxterm.

* XOVER support in popper.

* Better support for building shared libraries.

* Better support for talking to the KDC over TCP.  This could make it
  easier to use brain-damaged firewalls.

* Support FreeBSD-style MD5 /etc/passwd.

* New option `-createuser' to afslog.

* Upgraded to work with socks5-v1.0r1.

* Almost compiles and works on OS/2 with EMX, and Win95/NT with gnu-win32.

* Merged in win32-telnet, see README-WIN32 for more details.

* Possibly fixed telnet bug on HP-UX 10.

* Updated man-pages.

* Support for NetBSD/OpenBSD manual page circus.

* Bug fixes.

Major changes in release 0.9.3:

* kx has been rewritten and is now a lot easier to use.  Two new
  scripts: rxtelnet and rxterm.  It also works on machines such as
  Cray where the X-libraries cannot talk unix sockets.
	
* experimental OTP (RFC1938).  Included in login, ftpd, and popper.

* authentication modules: PAM for linux, SIA for OSF/1, and

* popper now has the UIDL command.

* ftpd can now tar and compress files and directories on the fly, also
  added a find site command.

  entry of .klogin, even when it's not possible to verify that there
  is no such file or the file is unreadable.

* Support for SRV-records.

* Socks v5 support.

* rcp is AFS-aware.

* allow for other transport mechanisms than udp (useful for firewall
  tormented souls); as a side effect the format of krb.conf had to
  become more flexible

* sample programs included.

* more portable

* quite a number of improvments/bugfixes

* New platforms: HP-UX 10, Irix 6.2

* New platforms: Digital UNIX 4.0 and Fujitsu UXP/V

* New mechanism to determine realm from hostname based on DNS. To find
  the realm of a.b.c.d it tries to find krb4-realm.a.b.c.d and then
  krb4-realm.b.c.d and so on. The entry in DNS should be a TXT record
  with the realm name.

  krb4-realm.pdc.kth.se.  7200    TXT     "NADA.KTH.SE"

	Use stdarg instead of varargs. The code is still broken though,
	you'll realize	that on a machine with 64 bit pointers and 32 bit 
	int:s and no vsprintf, let's hope there will be no such beasts ;-).

	* appl/telnet/telnetd/sys_term.c (getptyslave): Not all systems

	there is no such thing try afs@CELL instead. There is now two
	arguments to k_afslog(char *cell, char *realm).

	* kadmin/admin_server.c (kadm_listen): If we are multihomed we
        need to figure out which local address that is used this time
        since it is used in "direction" comparison.

	* kadmin/kadm_ser_wrap.c (kadm_ser_init): Fallback to use default
        port number.

	* lib/krb/send_to_kdc.c (send_to_kdc): Default port number

	variable DISPLAY and if hostname is not the full name, try to get
	the full name from DNS.

	* appl/telnet/telnet/main.c (main): Option -k realm was broken due
        to a bogous external declaration.

	* kadmin/kadmin.c (add_new_key): Kadmin now properly sets
	lifetime, expiration date and attributes in add_new_key command.

	* appl/bsd/su.c (main): Don't handle '-' option with getopt.

	10h so this should rarely be necessary.

	* lib/krb/krb_equiv.c (krb_equiv): If you don't want to use
	ipaddress protection of tickets set krb_ignore_ip_address. This
	makes it possible for an intruder to steal a ticket and then use
	it from som other machine anywhere on the net.

	* appl/telnet/telnetd/sys_term.c (login_tty): Ioctl TIOCSCTTY
        should not be used on HP-UX.

==========================*** Released 0.2? ***=============================

ksrvutil
  If there is a dot in the about to be added principals name there is
  no need to ask for instance name.

kerberos & kadmind
  Logfiles are created with small permissions (600).

krb.conf and krb.realms
 Use domain part as realm name if there is no match in krb.realms.
 Use kerberos.REALMNAME if there is no match in krb.realms.

rlogin
  The rlogin client is supported both with and without encryption,
  there is no rlogind yet though.

login
  There is login program that supports the -f option. Both kerberos
  and /etc/passwd authentication is enabled.

  Vendors login programs typically have no -f option (needed by
  telnetd) and also does not know how to verify passwords againts
  kerberos.

appl/bsd/*
  Now uses POSIX signals.

kdb_edit, kadmin
  Generate random passwords if administrator enters empty password.

lib/kafs
  New library to support AFS. Routines:
  int k_hasafs(void);
  int k_afsklog(...); or some other name
  int k_setpag(void);
  int k_unlog(void);
  int k_pioctl(char *, int, struct ViceIoctl *, int);

  Library supports more than one single entry point AFS syscalls
  (needed be HP/UX and OSF/1 when running DFS). Doesn't rely on
  transarc headers or library code. Same binaries can be used both on
  machines running AFS and others.

  This library is used in telnetd, login and the r* programs.

telnet & telnetd
  Based on telnet.95.05.31.NE but with the encryption hacks from
  ftp.funet.fi:/pub/unix/security/esrasrc-1.0 added.  This encryption
  stuff needed some more modifications (done by joda@nada.kth.se)
  before it was usable. Telnet has also been modified to use GNU
  autoconf.

Numerous other changes that are long since forgotten.
