PAM
---

The PAM module was written more out of curiosity that anything else. It
has not been updated for quite a while, but it seems to mostly work on
both Linux and Solaris.

To use this module you should:

   * Make sure `pam_krb4.so' is available in `/usr/athena/lib'. You
     might actually want it on local disk, so `/lib/security' might be a
     better place if `/usr/athena' is not local.

   * Look at `pam.conf.add' for examples of what to add to
     `/etc/pam.conf'.

There is currently no support for changing kerberos passwords. Use
kpasswd instead.

See also Derrick J Brashear's `<shadow@dementia.org>' Kerberos PAM
module at
<ftp://ftp.dementia.org/pub/pam>. It has a lot more features, and it is
also more in line with other PAM modules.
