 * krb_rd_priv() decrypts and checks the integrity of an

 * the length of that message, "in_length", the key "schedule"
 * and "key", and the network addresses of the
 * "sender" and "receiver" of the message, krb_rd_safe() returns
 * RD_AP_OK if the message is okay, otherwise some error code.
 *
 * The message data retrieved from "in" are returned in the structure
 * "m_data".  The pointer to the application data
 * (m_data->app_data) refers back to the appropriate place in "in".
 *
 * See the file "mk_priv.c" for the format of the AUTH_MSG_PRIVATE
