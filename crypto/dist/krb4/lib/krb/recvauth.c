/*
 * krb_recvauth() reads (and optionally responds to) a message sent
 * using krb_sendauth().  The "options" argument is a bit-field of
 * selected options (see "sendauth.c" for options description).
 * The only option relevant to krb_recvauth() is KOPT_DO_MUTUAL
 * (mutual authentication requested).  The "fd" argument supplies
 * a file descriptor to read from (and write to, if mutual authenti-
 * cation is requested).
 *
 * Part of the received message will be a Kerberos ticket sent by the
 * client; this is read into the "ticket" argument.  The "service" and
 * "instance" arguments supply the server's Kerberos name.  If the
 * "instance" argument is the string "*", it is treated as a wild card
 * and filled in during the krb_rd_req() call (see read_service_key()).
 *
 * The "faddr" and "laddr" give the sending (client) and receiving
 * (local server) network addresses.  ("laddr" may be left NULL unless
 * mutual authentication is requested, in which case it must be set.)
 *
 * The authentication information extracted from the message is returned
 * in "kdata".  The "filename" argument indicates the file where the
 * server's key can be found.  (It is passed on to krb_rd_req().)  If
 * left null, the default "/etc/srvtab" will be used.
 *
 * If mutual authentication is requested, the session key schedule must
 * be computed in order to reply; this schedule is returned in the
 * "schedule" argument.  A string containing the application version
 * number from the received message is returned in "version", which
 * should be large enough to hold a KRB_SENDAUTH_VLEN-character string.
 *
 * See krb_sendauth() for the format of the received client message.
 *
 * krb_recvauth() first reads the protocol version string from the
 * given file descriptor.  If it doesn't match the current protocol
 * version (KRB_SENDAUTH_VERS), the old-style format is assumed.  In
 * that case, the string of characters up to the first space is read
 * and interpreted as the ticket length, then the ticket is read.
 *
 * If the first string did match KRB_SENDAUTH_VERS, krb_recvauth()
 * next reads the application protocol version string.  Then the
 * ticket length and ticket itself are read.
 *
 * The ticket is decrypted and checked by the call to krb_rd_req().
 * If no mutual authentication is required, the result of the
 * krb_rd_req() call is retured by this routine.  If mutual authenti-
 * cation is required, a message in the following format is returned
 * on "fd":
 *
 * Size			Variable		Field
 * ----			--------		-----
 *
 * 4 bytes		tkt_len			length of ticket or -1
 *						if error occurred
 *
 * priv_len		tmp_buf			"private" message created
 *						by krb_mk_priv() which
 *						contains the incremented
 *						checksum sent by the client
 *						encrypted in the session
 *						key.  (This field is not
 *						present in case of error.)
 *
 * If all goes well, KSUCCESS is returned; otherwise KFAILURE or some
 * other error code is returned.
