/*
 * krb_sendauth() transmits a ticket over a file descriptor for a
 * desired service, instance, and realm, doing mutual authentication
 * with the server if desired.
 */

/*
 * The first argument to krb_sendauth() contains a bitfield of
 * options (the options are defined in "krb.h"):
 *
 * KOPT_DONT_CANON	Don't canonicalize instance as a hostname.
 *			(If this option is not chosen, krb_get_phost()
 *			is called to canonicalize it.)
 *
 * KOPT_DONT_MK_REQ 	Don't request server ticket from Kerberos.
 *			A ticket must be supplied in the "ticket"
 *			argument.
 *			(If this option is not chosen, and there
 *			is no ticket for the given server in the
 *			ticket cache, one will be fetched using
 *			krb_mk_req() and returned in "ticket".)
 *
 * KOPT_DO_MUTUAL	Do mutual authentication, requiring that the
 * 			receiving server return the checksum+1 encrypted
 *			in the session key.  The mutual authentication
 *			is done using krb_mk_priv() on the other side
 *			(see "recvauth.c") and krb_rd_priv() on this
 *			side.
 *
 * The "fd" argument is a file descriptor to write to the remote
 * server on.  The "ticket" argument is used to store the new ticket
 * from the krb_mk_req() call. If the KOPT_DONT_MK_REQ options is
 * chosen, the ticket must be supplied in the "ticket" argument.
 * The "service", "inst", and "realm" arguments identify the ticket.
 * If "realm" is null, the local realm is used.
 *
 * The following arguments are only needed if the KOPT_DO_MUTUAL option
 * is chosen:
 *
 *   The "checksum" argument is a number that the server will add 1 to
 *   to authenticate itself back to the client; the "msg_data" argument
 *   holds the returned mutual-authentication message from the server
 *   (i.e., the checksum+1); the "cred" structure is used to hold the
 *   session key of the server, extracted from the ticket file, for use
 *   in decrypting the mutual authentication message from the server;
 *   and "schedule" holds the key schedule for that decryption.  The
 *   the local and server addresses are given in "laddr" and "faddr".
 *
 * The application protocol version number (of up to KRB_SENDAUTH_VLEN
 * characters) is passed in "version".
 *
 * If all goes well, KSUCCESS is returned, otherwise some error code.
 *
 * The format of the message sent to the server is:
 *
 * Size			Variable		Field
 * ----			--------		-----
 *
 * KRB_SENDAUTH_VLEN	KRB_SENDAUTH_VER	sendauth protocol
 * bytes					version number
 *
 * KRB_SENDAUTH_VLEN	version			application protocol
 * bytes					version number
 *
 * 4 bytes		ticket->length		length of ticket
 *
 * ticket->length	ticket->dat		ticket itself
