/*
 * This routine takes a ticket and pointers to the variables that
 * should be filled in based on the information in the ticket.  It
 * fills in values for its arguments.
 *
 * The routine returns KFAILURE if any of the "pname", "pinstance",
 * or "prealm" fields is too big, otherwise it returns KSUCCESS.
 *
 * The corresponding routine to generate tickets is create_ticket.
 * When changes are made to this routine, the corresponding changes
 * should also be made to that file.
 *
 * See create_ticket.c for the format of the ticket packet.
