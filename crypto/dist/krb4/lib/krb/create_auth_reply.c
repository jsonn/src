/*
 * This routine is called by the Kerberos authentication server
 * to create a reply to an authentication request.  The routine
 * takes the user's name, instance, and realm, the client's
 * timestamp, the number of tickets, the user's key version
 * number and the ciphertext containing the tickets themselves.
 * It constructs a packet and returns a pointer to it.
 *
 * Notes: The packet returned by this routine is static.  Thus, if you
 * intend to keep the result beyond the next call to this routine, you
 * must copy it elsewhere.
 *
 * The packet is built in the following format:
 * 
 * 			variable
 * type			or constant	   data
 * ----			-----------	   ----
 * 
 * unsigned char	KRB_PROT_VERSION   protocol version number
 * 
 * unsigned char	AUTH_MSG_KDC_REPLY protocol message type
 * 
 * [least significant	HOST_BYTE_ORDER	   sender's (server's) byte
 *  bit of above field]			   order
 * 
 * string		pname		   principal's name
 * 
 * string		pinst		   principal's instance
 * 
 * string		prealm		   principal's realm
 * 
 * unsigned long	time_ws		   client's timestamp
 * 
 * unsigned char	n		   number of tickets
 * 
 * unsigned long	x_date		   expiration date
 * 
 * unsigned char	kvno		   master key version
 * 
 * short		w_1		   cipher length
 * 
 * ---			cipher->dat	   cipher data
