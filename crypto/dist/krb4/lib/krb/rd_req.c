 * checks its integrity and returns a judgement as to the requestor's
 * identity.
 *
 * The "authent" argument is a pointer to the received message.
 * The "service" and "instance" arguments name the receiving server,
 * and are used to get the service's ticket to decrypt the ticket
 * in the message, and to compare against the server name inside the
 * ticket.  "from_addr" is the network address of the host from which
 * the message was received; this is checked against the network
 * address in the ticket.  If "from_addr" is zero, the check is not
 * performed.  "ad" is an AUTH_DAT structure which is
 * filled in with information about the sender's identity according
 * to the authenticator and ticket sent in the message.  Finally,
 * "fn" contains the name of the file containing the server's key.
 * (If "fn" is NULL, the server's key is assumed to have been set
 * by krb_set_key().  If "fn" is the null string ("") the default
 * file KEYFILE, defined in "krb.h", is used.)
 *
 * krb_rd_req() returns RD_AP_OK if the authentication information
 * was genuine, or one of the following error codes (defined in
 * "krb.h"):
 *
 *	RD_AP_VERSION		- wrong protocol version number
 *	RD_AP_MSG_TYPE		- wrong message type
 *	RD_AP_UNDEC		- couldn't decipher the message
 *	RD_AP_INCON		- inconsistencies found
 *	RD_AP_BADD		- wrong network address
 *	RD_AP_TIME		- client time (in authenticator)
 *				  too far off server time
 *	RD_AP_NYV		- Kerberos time (in ticket) too
 *				  far off server time
 *	RD_AP_EXP		- ticket expired
 *
 * For the message format, see krb_mk_req().
 *
 * Mutual authentication is not implemented.
