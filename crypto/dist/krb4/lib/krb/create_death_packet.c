/*
 * This routine creates a packet to type AUTH_MSG_DIE which is sent to
 * the Kerberos server to make it shut down.  It is used only in the
 * development environment.
 *
 * It takes a string "a_name" which is sent in the packet.  A pointer
 * to the packet is returned.
 *
 * The format of the killer packet is:
 *
 * type			variable		data
 *			or constant
 * ----			-----------		----
 *
 * unsigned char	KRB_PROT_VERSION	protocol version number
 * 
 * unsigned char	AUTH_MSG_DIE		message type
 * 
 * [least significant	HOST_BYTE_ORDER		byte order of sender
 *  bit of above field]
 * 
 * string		a_name			presumably, name of
