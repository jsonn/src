/*
 * The private keys for servers on a given host are stored in a
 * "srvtab" file (typically "/etc/srvtab").  This routine extracts
 * a given server's key from the file.
 *
 * read_service_key() takes the server's name ("service"), "instance",
 * and "realm" and a key version number "kvno", and looks in the given
 * "file" for the corresponding entry, and if found, returns the entry's
 * key field in "key".
 * 
 * If "instance" contains the string "*", then it will match
 * any instance, and the chosen instance will be copied to that
 * string.  For this reason it is important that the there is enough
 * space beyond the "*" to receive the entry.
 *
 * If "kvno" is 0, it is treated as a wild card and the first
 * matching entry regardless of the "vno" field is returned.
 *
 * This routine returns KSUCCESS on success, otherwise KFAILURE.
 *
 * The format of each "srvtab" entry is as follows:
 *
 * Size			Variable		Field in file
 * ----			--------		-------------
 * string		serv			server name
 * string		inst			server instance
 * string		realm			server realm
 * 1 byte		vno			server key version #
 * 8 bytes		key			server's key
 * ...			...			...
