/*
 * get_ad_tkt obtains a new service ticket from Kerberos, using
 * the ticket-granting ticket which must be in the ticket file.
 * It is typically called by krb_mk_req() when the client side
 * of an application is creating authentication information to be
 * sent to the server side.
 *
 * get_ad_tkt takes four arguments: three pointers to strings which
 * contain the name, instance, and realm of the service for which the
 * ticket is to be obtained; and an integer indicating the desired
 * lifetime of the ticket.
 *
 * It returns an error status if the ticket couldn't be obtained,
 * or AD_OK if all went well.  The ticket is stored in the ticket
 * cache.
 *
 * The request sent to the Kerberos ticket-granting service looks
 * like this:
 *
 * pkt->dat
 *
 * TEXT			original contents of	authenticator+ticket
 *			pkt->dat		built in krb_mk_req call
 * 
 * 4 bytes		time_ws			always 0 (?)
 * char			lifetime		lifetime argument passed
 * string		service			service name argument
 * string		sinstance		service instance arg.
 *
 * See "prot.h" for the reply packet layout and definitions of the
 * extraction macros like pkt_version(), pkt_msg_type(), etc.
