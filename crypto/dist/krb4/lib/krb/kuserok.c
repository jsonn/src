/* 
 * Given a Kerberos principal and a local username, determine whether
 * user is authorized to login according to the authorization file
 * ("~luser/.klogin" by default).  Returns OK if authorized, NOTOK if
 * not authorized.
 *
 * IMPORTANT CHANGE: To eliminate the need of making a distinction
 * between the 3 cases:
 *
 * 1. We can't verify that a .klogin file doesn't exist (no home dir).
 * 2. It's there but we aren't allowed to read it.
 * 3. We can read it and ~luser@LOCALREALM is (not) included.
 *
 * We instead make the assumption that luser@LOCALREALM is *always*
 * included. Thus it is impossible to have an empty .klogin file and
 * also to exclude luser@LOCALREALM from it. Root is treated differently
 * since it's home should always be available.
 *
 * OLD STRATEGY:
 * If there is no account for "luser" on the local machine, returns
 * NOTOK.  If there is no authorization file, and the given Kerberos
 * name "kdata" translates to the same name as "luser" (using
 * krb_kntoln()), returns OK.  Otherwise, if the authorization file
 * can't be accessed, returns NOTOK.  Otherwise, the file is read for
 * a matching principal name, instance, and realm.  If one is found,
 * returns OK, if none is found, returns NOTOK.
 *
 * The file entries are in the format:
 *
 *	name.instance@realm
 *
 * one entry per line.
