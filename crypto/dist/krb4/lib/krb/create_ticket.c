/*
 * Create ticket takes as arguments information that should be in a
 * ticket, and the KTEXT object in which the ticket should be
 * constructed.  It then constructs a ticket and returns, leaving the
 * newly created ticket in tkt.
 * The length of the ticket is a multiple of
 * eight bytes and is in tkt->length.
 *
 * If the ticket is too long, the ticket will contain nulls.
 *
 * The corresponding routine to extract information from a ticket it
 * decomp_ticket.  When changes are made to this routine, the
 * corresponding changes should also be made to that file.
 *
 * The packet is built in the following format:
 * 
 * 			variable
 * type			or constant	   data
 * ----			-----------	   ----
 *
 * tkt->length		length of ticket (multiple of 8 bytes)
 * 
 * tkt->dat:
 * 
 * unsigned char	flags		   namely, HOST_BYTE_ORDER
 * 
 * string		pname		   client's name
 * 
 * string		pinstance	   client's instance
 * 
 * string		prealm		   client's realm
 * 
 * 4 bytes		paddress	   client's address
 * 
 * 8 bytes		session		   session key
 * 
 * 1 byte		life		   ticket lifetime
 * 
 * 4 bytes		time_sec	   KDC timestamp
 * 
 * string		sname		   service's name
 * 
 * string		sinstance	   service's instance
 * 
 * <=7 bytes		null		   null pad to 8 byte multiple
