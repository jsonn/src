	How to update your files in the /etc directory!

/etc/services (all machines)

  The contents of services.append can probably just be appended to
your local file. If you use NIS (YP) you need to do this on the NIS
master. Delete and duplicate definitions to prevent inconsistencies.

/etc/krb.conf (all machines)

  Create a krb.conf file by substituting MY.REALM.NAME with your
domain name. If you create a domain name alias (CNAME) kerberos.domain
pointing to your master server, unconfigured clients will have a
chance to find your realm.

  It is no longer necessary to put each and every realm in
krb.{conf,realms}. If the domain name matches your realm name and you
have a CNAME kerberos.REALMNAME pointing at your kerberos server other
sites will find your realm even if it is not listed in krb.conf.  
*** Please add this CNAME to your local DNS ***

/etc/krb.realms (all machines)

  Substitue MY.REALM.NAME in krb.realms with your domain name.
  Not strictly necessary when domain and realm names match.

/etc/inetd.conf (all machines supporting incoming telnet, rsh etc.)

  Comment out the lines starting with shell, login and telnet and
append inetd.conf.changes. Be carefull to check that there are no
additional old entries of kshell, ekshell, klogin and eklogin left.

  The -v option to rshd and rlogin turns off that service and echo
an informational message to the user.

/etc/srvtab

  With 'ksrvutil get' you can add entries to the Kerberos database and
put the service keys into your srvtab file.
