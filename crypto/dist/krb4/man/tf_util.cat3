      This group of routines are provided to manipulate the Kerberos tickets
      file.  A ticket file has the following format:

          principal's name          (null-terminated string)
          principal's instance      (null-terminated string)
          CREDENTIAL_1
          CREDENTIAL_2
            ...
          CREDENTIAL_n
          EOF

      Where "CREDENTIAL_x" consists of the following fixed-length
      fields from the CREDENTIALS structure (defined in <krb.h>):

               char      service[ANAME_SZ]
               char      instance[INST_SZ]
               char      realm[REALM_SZ]
               des_cblock     session
               int       lifetime
               int       kvno
               KTEXT_ST  ticket_st
               long      issue_date


      _t_f___i_n_i_t must be called before the other ticket file routines.  It
      takes the name of the ticket file to use, and a read/write flag as

      arguments.  It tries to open the ticket file, checks the mode and if
      everything is okay, locks the file.  If it's opened for reading, the
      lock is shared.  If it's opened for writing, the lock is exclusive.
      KSUCCESS is returned if all went well, otherwise one of the following:

      NO_TKT_FIL     - file wasn't there
      TKT_FIL_ACC    - file was in wrong mode, etc.
      TKT_FIL_LCK    - couldn't lock the file, even after a retry


      The _t_f___g_e_t___p_n_a_m_e reads the principal's name from a ticket file.  It
      should only be called after tf_init has been called.  The principal's
      name is filled into the _p_n_a_m_e parameter.  If all goes well, KSUCCESS
      is returned.  If tf_init wasn't called, TKT_FIL_INI is returned.  If
      the principal's name was null, or EOF was encountered, or the name was
      longer than ANAME_SZ, TKT_FIL_FMT is returned.

      The _t_f___g_e_t___p_i_n_s_t reads the principal's instance from a ticket file.
      It should only be called after tf_init and tf_get_pname have been
      called.  The principal's instance is filled into the _p_i_n_s_t parameter.
      If all goes well, KSUCCESS is returned.  If tf_init wasn't called,
      TKT_FIL_INI is returned.  If EOF was encountered, or the name was
      longer than INST_SZ, TKT_FIL_FMT is returned.  Note that, unlike the
      principal name, the instance name may be null.

      The _t_f___g_e_t___c_r_e_d routine reads a CREDENTIALS record from a ticket file
      and fills in the given structure.  It should only be called after
      tf_init, tf_get_pname, and tf_get_pinst have been called.  If all goes
      well, KSUCCESS is returned.  Possible error codes are:

      TKT_FIL_INI    - tf_init wasn't called first
      TKT_FIL_FMT    - bad format
      EOF       - end of file encountered


      _t_f___c_l_o_s_e closes the ticket file and releases the lock on it.
