      _P_o_p_p_e_r is an implementation of the Post Office  Protocol  server  that
      runs  on  a  variety  of  Unix computers to manage electronic mail for
      Macintosh and MS-DOS computers.   The  server  was  developed  at  the
      University  of  California  at  Berkeley  and  conforms  fully  to the
      specifications in RFC 1081 and RFC 1082.  The Berkeley server also has
      extensions to send electronic mail on behalf of a client.

      The  --dd flag sets the socket to debugging and turns on debugging.  All
      debugging information is saved using syslog(8).

      The --tt  ttrraaccee--ffiillee  flag  turns  on  debugging  and  saves  the  trace
      information in _t_r_a_c_e_-_f_i_l_e using fprintf(s).

      The --kk flag tells popper to talk the kerberised POP protocol (KPOP).

      The  --aa  flag  tells popper not to accept any cleartext passwords, but
      only OTPs.

      The --ii flag tells popper it has not been started by inetd  and  should
      create its own socket and listen on it.  This is useful for debugging.

      The --pp ppoorrttnnuumm flag tells popper on which port it  should  listen  for
      connections when creating a socket.

      The POP server is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.CC.Berkeley.EDU
      (128.32.136.9,  128.32.206.12).   It  is  in  two  files  in  the  pub
      directory:  a compressed tar file popper.tar.Z and a Macintosh StuffIt
      archive in BinHex format called MacPOP.sit.hqx.

      The Berkeley POP server is a single program (called  popper)  that  is
      launched  by inetd when it gets a service request on the POP TCP port.
      (The official port number specified in RFC 1081 for POP version  3  is
      port 110.  However, some POP3 clients attempt to contact the server at
      port 109, the POP version 2 port.  Unless you are  running  both  POP2
      and POP3 servers, you can simply define both ports for use by the POP3
      server.  This is explained in the installation instructions later on.)
      The  popper  program initializes and verifies that the peer IP address
      is registered in the local domain, logging a warning  message  when  a
      connection  is  made  to  a  client  whose  IP address does not have a
      canonical name.  For systems using BSD 4.3 bind, it also checks to see
      if  a  cannonical  name lookup for the client returns the same peer IP

      address, logging a warning message if it does  not.   The  the  server
      enters the authorization state, during which the client must correctly
      identify itself by providing a valid Unix userid and password  on  the
      server's  host  machine.   No  other exchanges are allowed during this
      state (other than a request to  quit.)   If  authentication  fails,  a
      warning  message  is  logged  and  the session ends.  Once the user is
      identified, popper changes its user and group ids to match that of the
      user  and  enters the transaction state.  The server makes a temporary
      copy of the user's maildrop (ordinarily in /usr/spool/mail)  which  is
      used  for  all subsequent transactions.  These include the bulk of POP
      commands to retrieve mail, delete mail, undelete mail, and  so  forth.
      A  Berkeley  extension also allows the user to submit a mail parcel to
      the server who mails it using the sendmail program (this extension  is
      supported  in the HyperMail client distributed with the server).  When
      the client quits, the server enters  the  final  update  state  during
      which  the network connection is terminated and the user's maildrop is
      updated with the (possibly) modified temporary maildrop.

      The POP server uses syslog to keep a record  of  its  activities.   On
      systems  with  BSD 4.3 syslogging, the server logs (by default) to the
      "local0"  facility  at  priority  "notice"  for  all  messages  except
      debugging  which  is logged at priority "debug".  The default log file
      is /usr/spool/mqueue/POPlog.  These can be changed,  if  desired.   On
      systems  with  4.2 syslogging all messages are logged to the local log
      file, usually /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog.

 DDEEBBUUGGGGIINNGG
      The  popper  program  will  log  debugging  information  when  the  -d
      parameter  is  specified  after its invocation in the inetd.conf file.
      Care should be exercised in  using  this  option  since  it  generates
      considerable output in the syslog file.  Alternatively, the "-t <file-
      name>" option will place debugging information into file "<file-name>"
      using fprintf instead of syslog.

      For  SunOS  version  3.5, the popper program is launched by inetd from
      /etc/servers.  This file does not allow you to  specify  command  line
      arguments.   Therefore,  if  you  want  to  enable  debugging, you can
      specify a shell script in  /etc/servers  to  be  launched  instead  of
      popper and in this script call popper with the desired arguments.

      You can confirm that the POP server is running on Unix by telneting to
      port 110 (or 109 if you set it up that way).  For example:

      %telnet myhost 110
      Trying...
      Connected to myhost.berkeley.edu.
      Escape character is '^]'.
      +OK UCB Pop server (version 1.6) at myhost starting.
      quit
      Connection closed by foreign host.

      Extensive re-write of the  maildrop  processing  code  contributed  by
      Viktor  Dukhovni  <viktor@math.princeton.edu> that greatly reduces the
      possibility that the maildrop  can  be  corrupted  as  the  result  of
      simultaneous access by two or more processes.

      Added  "pop_dropcopy"  module  to create a temporary maildrop from the
      existing, standard maildrop as root before the setuid and  setgid  for
      the user is done.  This allows the temporary maildrop to be created in
      a mail spool area that is not world read-writable.

      This version does *not* send the sendmail "From "  delimiter  line  in
      response to a TOP or RETR command.

      Encased  all debugging code in #ifdef DEBUG constructs.  This code can
      be included by specifying the DEGUG compiler flag.  Note:   You  still
      need to use the -d or -t option to obtain debugging output.

 LLIIMMIITTAATTIIOONNSS
      The  POP  server  copies  the  user's entire maildrop to /tmp and then
      operates on that copy.  If the  maildrop  is  particularly  large,  or
      inadequate  space is available in /tmp, then the server will refuse to
      continue and terminate the connection.

      Simultaneous modification of a single maildrop can result in confusing
      results.   For  example, manipulating messages in a maildrop using the
      Unix /usr/ucb/mail command while a copy of it is  being  processed  by
      the  POP  server  can cause the changes made by one program to be lost
      when the other terminates.  This problem is being worked on  and  will
      be fixed in a later release.
