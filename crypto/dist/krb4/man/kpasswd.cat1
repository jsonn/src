      The _k_p_a_s_s_w_d command is used to change a Kerberos principal's password.

      If the _-_h option is specified, a brief summary of the options is
      printed, and _k_p_a_s_s_w_d then exits.

      If the _-_n option is specified, _n_a_m_e is used as the principal name
      rather than the username of the user running _k_p_a_s_s_w_d.  (This is
      determined from the ticket file if it exists; otherwise, it is
      determined from the unix user id.)

      If the _-_i option is specified, _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e is used as the instance rather
      than a null instance.

      If the _-_r option is specified, _r_e_a_l_m is used as the realm rather than
      the local realm.

      If the _-_u option is specified, a fully qualified kerberos principal
      can be given.

      The utility prompts for the current Kerberos password (printing the
      name of the principal for which it intends to change the password),
      which is verified by the Kerberos server.  If the old password is
      correct, the user is prompted twice for the new password.  A message
      is printed indicating the success or failure of the password changing
      operation.


 BBUUGGSS
      _k_p_a_s_s_w_d does not handle names, instances, or realms with special
      characters in them when the -n, -i, or -r options are used.  Any valid
      fullname is accepted, however, if the -u option is used.

      If the principal whose password you are trying to change does not
      exist, you will not be told until after you have entered the old
      password.
