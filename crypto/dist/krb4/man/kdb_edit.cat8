      _k_d_b___e_d_i_t is used to create or change principals stored in the Kerberos
      key distribution center (KDC) database.

      When executed, _k_d_b___e_d_i_t prompts for the master key string and verifies
      that it matches the master key stored in the database.  If the --nn
      option is specified, the master key is instead fetched from the master
      key cache file.

      Once the master key has been verified, _k_d_b___e_d_i_t begins a prompt loop.
      The user is prompted for the principal and instance to be modified.
      If the entry is not found the user may create it.  Once an entry is
      found or created, the user may set the password, expiration date,
      maximum ticket lifetime, and attributes.  Default expiration dates,
      maximum ticket lifetimes, and attributes are presented in brackets; if
      the user presses return the default is selected.  There is no default
      password.  The password RANDOM is interpreted specially, and if
      entered the user may have the program select a random DES key for the
      principal.

      Upon successfully creating or changing the entry, ``Edit O.K.'' is
      printed.
