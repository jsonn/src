     Changes to the database, such as changed passwords, are only made to the
     master server through the kkaaddmmiinndd service. To propagate these changes to
     the slave servers, kkpprroopp should be run regularly on the master server.

     The following options are recognised.


     --ffoorrccee  Propagate even if there hasn't been an update to the dump file
             since last time.

     --rreeaallmm  Realm if other than the default.

     dump-file
             is a file created with kkddbb__uuttiill ssllaavvee__dduummpp, default is
             _/_v_a_r_/_k_e_r_b_e_r_o_s_/_s_l_a_v_e___d_u_m_p.

     slave-file
             Contains the names of the slave servers. Default is
             _/_v_a_r_/_k_e_r_b_e_r_o_s_/_s_l_a_v_e_s.

     kkpprroopp will use the principal rrccmmdd..kkeerrbbeerrooss to authenticate to the master
     servers. This principal has to be added to the database, and it should
     also be put into the service key file on the master server.
