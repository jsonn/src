      _k_u_s_e_r_o_k determines whether a Kerberos principal described by the
      structure _a_u_t_h___d_a_t_a is authorized to login as user _l_o_c_a_l_u_s_e_r according
      to the authorization file ("~_l_o_c_a_l_u_s_e_r/.klogin" by default).  It
      returns 0 (zero) if authorized, 1 (one) if not authorized.

      If there is no account for _l_o_c_a_l_u_s_e_r on the local machine,
      authorization is not granted.  If there is no authorization file, and
      the Kerberos principal described by _a_u_t_h___d_a_t_a translates to _l_o_c_a_l_u_s_e_r
      (using _k_r_b___k_n_t_o_l_n(3)), authorization is granted.  If the authorization
      file can't be accessed, or the file is not owned by _l_o_c_a_l_u_s_e_r_,
      authorization is denied.  Otherwise, the file is searched for a
      matching principal name, instance, and realm.  If a match is found,
      authorization is granted, else authorization is denied.

      The file entries are in the format:
                name.instance@realm
      with one entry per line.

      For convenience ~localuser@LOCALREALM is always considered to be an
      entry in the file even when there is no file or the file is
      unreadable.
