.TH KRB.REALMS 5 "Kerberos Version 4.0" "MIT Project Athena"
.SH NAME
/etc/krb.realms \- host to Kerberos realm translation file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb.realms
provides a translation from a hostname to the Kerberos realm name for
the services provided by that host.
.PP
Each line of the translation file is in one of the following forms
(domain_name should be of the form .XXX.YYY, e.g. .LCS.MIT.EDU):
.nf
.in +5n
host_name kerberos_realm
domain_name kerberos_realm
.in -5n
.fi
If a hostname exactly matches the 
.I host_name
field in a line of the first
form, the corresponding realm is the realm of the host.
If a hostname does not match any 
.I host_name
in the file, but its
domain exactly matches the 
.I domain_name
field in a line of the second
form, the corresponding realm is the realm of the host.
.PP
If no translation entry applies, the host's realm is considered to be
the hostname's domain portion converted to upper case.
