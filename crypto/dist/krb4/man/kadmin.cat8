     This utility provides a unified administration interface to the Kerberos
     master database.  Kerberos administrators use kkaaddmmiinn to register new
     users and services to the master database, and to change information
     about existing database entries, such as changing a user's Kerberos pass-
     word. A Kerberos administrator is a user with an ``admin'' instance whose
     name appears on one of the Kerberos administration access control lists.

     Supported options:

     --pp _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
             This is the adminstrator principal to use when talking to the
             Kadmin server. The default is taken from the users environment.

     --rr _r_e_a_l_m
             This is the default realm to use for transactions. Default is the
             local realm.

     --uu _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
             This is similar to --pp, but specifies a name, that gets appended
             with a ``admin'' instance.

     --TT _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
             To prevent someone from walking up to an unguarded terminal and
             doing malicious things, administrator tickets are destroyed after
             a period of inactivity. This flag changes the timeout from the
             default of one minute. A timeout of zero seconds disables this
             functionality.

     --mm      Historically kkaaddmmiinn destroyed tickets after every command; this
             flag used to stop this behaviour (only destroying tickets upon
             exit). Now it's just a synonym for --TT _0.

     --tt      Use existing tickets (if any are available), this also disbles
             timeout, and doesn't destroy any tickets upon exit.

             These tickets have to be for the changepw.kerberos service.  Use
             kkiinniitt --pp to acquire them.

     The kkaaddmmiinn program communicates over the network with the kkaaddmmiinndd pro-
     gram, which runs on the machine housing the Kerberos master database, and
     does the actual modifications to the database.

     When you enter the kkaaddmmiinn command, the program displays a message that
     welcomes you and explains how to ask for help.  Then kkaaddmmiinn waits for you
     to enter commands (which are described below).  It then asks you for your
     administrator's password before accessing the database.

     All commands can be abbreviated as long as they are unique.  Some short
     versions of the commands are also recognized for backwards compatibility.

     Recognised commands:

     add_new_key _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
             Creates a new principal in the Kerberos database. You give the
             name of the new principal as an argument. You will then be asked
             for a maximum ticket lifetime, attributes, the expiration date of
             the principal, and finally the password of the principal.

     change_password _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
             Changes a principal's password. You will be prompted for the new
             password.

     change_key _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
             This is the same as change_password, but the password is given as
             a raw DES key (for the few occations when you need this).

     change_admin_password
             Changes your own admin password. It will prompt you for you old
             and new passwords.

     del_entry _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
             Removes principal from the database.

     get_entry _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
             Show various information for the given principal. Note that the
             key is shown as zeros.

     mod_entry _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l
             Modifies a particular entry, for instance to change the expira-
             tion date.

     destroy_tickets
             Destroys your admin tickets explicitly.

     quit    Obvious.

     The user interface is primitive, and the command names could be better.
