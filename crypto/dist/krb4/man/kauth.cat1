     The kkaauutthh command obtains ticket granting tickets as well as AFS ticket
     and tokens. It also does a whole lot of other stuff.

     The following flags are supported:

     --nn    Principal to get tickets for. If no other arguments are present
           this can be given without the --nn flag.

     --hh    Remote hosts to obtain tickets for. This works similar to the MIT
           Athena Kerberos 4 patchlevel 10 command rkinit(1),  however not in
           a compatible way. It requires that the remote host runs the
           kauthd(8),  server. The --rr and --tt flags are useful only with this
           option.

     --rr    User on the remote host that should own the ticket file.

     --tt    Ticket file on remote host.

     --ll    Lifetime of tickets in minutes. A value of -1 is used for maximum
           ticket lifetime.

     --ff    Srvtab to get service keys from. Default is _/_e_t_c_/_s_r_v_t_a_b. This is
           mainly used with batch services that need to run authenticated. If
           any command is given, it will be executed in an authenticated fash-
           ion and when the program exits the tickets are destroyed. For long
           running jobs the tickets will be renewed.

     --cc    AFS cell to get tokens for, default is your local cell.
