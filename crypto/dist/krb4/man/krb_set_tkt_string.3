.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb_set_tkt_string
sets the name of the file that holds the user's
cache of Kerberos server tickets and associated session keys.
.PP
The string 
.I filename
passed in is copied into local storage.
Only MAXPATHLEN-1 (see <sys/param.h>) characters of the filename are
copied in for use as the cache file name.

This routine should be called during initialization, before other
Kerberos routines are called; otherwise the routines which fetch the
ticket cache file name may be called and return an undesired ticket file
name until this routine is called.
.SH FILES

default ticket file name, unless the environment variable KRBTKFILE is set.
[uid] denotes the user's uid, in decimal.
