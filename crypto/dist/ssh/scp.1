.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
copies files between hosts on a network.
It uses
.Xr ssh 1
for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the
same security as
.Xr ssh 1 .
Unlike
.Xr rcp 1 ,
.Nm
will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
authentication.
.Pp
Any file name may contain a host and user specification to indicate
that the file is to be copied to/from that host.
Copies between two remote hosts are permitted.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar cipher
Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl i Ar identity_file
Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for RSA
authentication is read.
This option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl p
Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
original file.
.It Fl r
Recursively copy entire directories.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Causes
.Nm
and
.Xr ssh 1
to print debugging messages about their progress.
This is helpful in
debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.
.It Fl B
Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or passphrases).
.It Fl q
Disables the progress meter.
.It Fl C
Compression enable.
Passes the
.Fl C
flag to
.Xr ssh 1
to enable compression.
.It Fl P Ar port
Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
Note that this option is written with a capital
.Sq P ,
because
.Fl p
is already reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file in
.Xr rcp 1 .
.It Fl S Ar program
Name of
.Ar program
to use for the encrypted connection.
The program must understand
.Xr ssh 1
options.
.It Fl o Ar option
The given option is directly passed to
.Xr ssh 1 .
.It Fl 4
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Forces
.Nm
to use IPv6 addresses only.
