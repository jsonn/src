/*
 * SSH Protocol 1.5 aka New Channel Protocol
 * Thanks to Martina, Axel and everyone who left Erlangen, leaving me bored.
 * Written by Markus Friedl in October 1999
 *
 * Protocol versions 1.3 and 1.5 differ in the handshake protocol used for the
 * tear down of channels:
 *
 * 1.3:	strict request-ack-protocol:
 * 	CLOSE	->
 * 		<-  CLOSE_CONFIRM
 *
 * 1.5:	uses variations of:
 * 	IEOF	->
 * 		<-  OCLOSE
 * 		<-  IEOF
 * 	OCLOSE	->
 * 	i.e. both sides have to close the channel
 *
 * See the debugging output from 'ssh -v' and 'sshd -d' of
 * ssh-1.2.27 as an example.
 *
