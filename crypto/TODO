$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.3.2.2 2000/06/21 04:08:33 thorpej Exp $

- Make KTH Kerberos IV API like the Berkeley'ized MIT API that
  appeared in 4.4BSD.  This also means include paths and library
  requirements.

- Make the Heimdal Kerberos V API much more like the MIT API.  The
  current situation means that basically no krb5-aware programs can
  work with Heimdal without significant modification.  This includes
  making compatibility links for e.g. libk5crypto -> libcrypto, etc.

  Currently known-broken Kerberos-aware packages:

  - ssh and ssh6
  - cvs
  - sudo

- Fix the telnet situation.  The Heimdal telnet suite appears to
  be an older version of the NetBSD telnet suite with all of the
  tn3270 support ripped out.  What we should probably just do is
  lift the crypto-us telnet suite and add support for Heimdal krb5
  to it.

- Make rcp, rlogin, ftpd, and ftp work with Kerberos again.

- Decide if we're going to really try and support both krb4 and
  krb5.  It's hard to make programs work with both, and having
  to decide at compile-time really sucks.

- Make passwd(1) fall back to non-Kerberos properly.  Right now, it
  aborts, meaning you have to specify -l, or whatever.

- Nuke .cat* and .info files from src/crypto/dist.
