.Sh NAME
.Nm rcp
.Nd remote file copy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Kpx
.Op Fl k Ar realm
.Ar file1 file2
.Nm ""
.Op Fl Kprx
.Op Fl k Ar realm
.Ar file ...
.Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
copies files between machines.  Each
.Ar file
or
.Ar directory
argument is either a remote file name of the
form ``rname@rhost:path'', or a local file name (containing no `:' characters,
or a `/' before any `:'s).
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl K
The
.Fl K
option turns off all Kerberos authentication.
.It Fl k
The
.Fl k
option requests
.Nm
to obtain tickets
for the remote host in realm
.Ar realm
instead of the remote host's realm as determined by
.Xr krb_realmofhost  3  .
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option causes
.Nm
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Ar umask  .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar file2
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask  2
on the destination host is used.
.It Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option turns on
.Tn DES
encryption for all data passed by
.Nm "" .
This may impact response time and
.Tn CPU
utilization, but provides
increased security.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar path
is not a full path name, it is interpreted relative to
the login directory of the specified user
.Ar ruser
on
.Ar rhost  ,
or your current user name if no other remote user name is specified.
A
.Ar path
on a remote host may be quoted (using \e, ", or \(aa)
so that the metacharacters are interpreted remotely.
.Pp
.Nm
does not prompt for passwords; it performs remote execution
via
.Xr rsh  1  ,
and requires the same authorization.
.Pp
.Nm
handles third party copies, where neither source nor target files
are on the current machine.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr ftp 1 ,
.Xr rsh 1 ,
.Xr rlogin 1 ,
.Xr hosts.equiv 5 ,
.Xr rhosts 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
The version of
.Nm
described here
has been reimplemented with Kerberos in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
.Sh BUGS
Doesn't detect all cases where the target of a copy might
be a file in cases where only a directory should be legal.
.Pp
Is confused by any output generated by commands in a
.Pa \&.login ,
.Pa \&.profile ,
or
.Pa \&.cshrc
file on the remote host.
.Pp
The destination user and hostname may have to be specified as
``rhost.rname'' when the destination machine is running the
.Bx 4.2
version of
.Nm "" .
