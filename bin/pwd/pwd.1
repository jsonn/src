.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd
.Nd return working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl LP
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl L
Print the logical path to the current working directory, as indicated
by the shell in the evironment variable
.Ev PWD ,
if possible.
.It Fl P
Print the physical path to the current working directory, with symbolic
links in the path resolved. This is the default.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cd 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is expected to be conforming to
.St -p1003.2 .
The options are extensions to the standard.
.Sh BUGS
In
.Xr csh 1
the command
.Ic dirs
is always faster (although it can give a different answer in the rare case
that the current directory or a containing directory was moved after
the shell descended into it).
