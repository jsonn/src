.Dt GETNAME 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getNAME
.Nd "get NAME sections from manual source for whatis/apropos data base"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl itvw
.Ar path Op Ar path ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility looks inside manual page sources to find the name of the page.
It can be used to create a table of contents, report the style of manual,
or to create an introductory manual page.
By default,
.Nm
returns data for use in an
.Xr apropos 1
database.
.Nm
is designed to be called from manual grovelling tools, not to be used directly.
.Pp
Historically,
.Xr makewhatis 8
used to use
.Nm
to get manpage names, but that's no longer the case.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Print information useful in creating an introduction manual.
See
.Xr intro 1 ,
.Xr intro 2 ,
etc. for examples.
.It Fl t
Print information useful for creating a table of contents.
.It Fl v
Complain about incorrectly formatted man pages.
.It Fl w
Print information whether the manpage uses traditional man
.Pq Dq OLD ,
new mandoc
.Pq Dq NEW ,
or some unknown
.Pq Dq UNKNOWN
macros.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr man 1 ,
.Xr catman 8 ,
.Xr makewhatis 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Bx 2.0 .
.Sh BUGS
It would be nice if
.Nm
could deal with compressed and/or preformatted manual pages.
Looks for .S[Hh] NAME for consistency checking, but that breaks man pages
in other languages.
