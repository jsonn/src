.Sh NAME
.Nm ftpd.conf
.Nd
.Xr ftpd 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies various configuration options for
.Xr ftpd 8
that apply once a user has authenticated their connection.
.Pp
Each authenticated user is a member of a
.Sy class ,
which is determined by
.Xr ftpusers 5 .
.Sy class
is used to determine which
.Nm
entries apply to the user.
The following special classes exist when parsing entries in
.Nm "" :
.Bl -tag -width "chroot" -compact -offset indent
.It Sy all
Matches any class.
.It Sy none
Matches no class.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
consists of a series of lines, each of which may contain a
configuration directive, a comment, or a blank line.
Directives that appear later in the file override settings by previous
directives.
This allows
.Sq wildcard
entries to define defaults, and then have class-specific overrides.
.Pp
A
.Dq \e
is the escape character; it can be used to escape the meaning of the
comment character, or if it is the last character on a line, extends
a configuration directive across multiple lines.
A
.Dq #
is the comment character, and all characters from it to the end of
line are ignored (unless it is escaped with the escape character).
.Pp
The
.Xr ftpd 8
.Sy STAT
command will return the class settings for the current user as defined by
.Nm "" .
.Pp
Each configuration line may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy checkportcmd Ar class Op Sy off
Check the
PORT
command for validity.
The
PORT
command will fail if the IP address specified does not match the
.Tn FTP
command connection, or if the remote TCP port number is less than
.Dv IPPORT_RESERVED .
It is
.Em strongly
encouraged that this option be used, espcially for sites concerned
with potential security problems with
.Tn FTP
bounce attacks.
If class is
.Dq none
or
.Sy off
is given, disable this feature, otherwise enable it.
.It Sy classtype Ar class Ar type
Set the class type of
.Ar class
to
.Ar type .
.Ar type
may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width "CHROOT" -offset indent
.It Sy GUEST
Guests (as per the
.Dq anonymous
and
.Dq ftp
logins).
A
.Xr chroot 2
is performed after login.
.It Sy CHROOT
.Xr chroot 2 ed
users (as per
.Xr ftpchroot 5 ) .
A
.Xr chroot 2
is performed after login.
.It Sy REAL
Normal users.
.El
.It Xo Sy conversion Ar class
.Ar suffix Op Ar "type disable command"
.Xc
Define an automatic in-line file conversion.
If a file to retrieve ends in
.Ar suffix ,
and a real file (sans
.Ar suffix )
exists, then the output of
.Ar command
is returned instead of the contents of the file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "disable" -offset indent
.It Ar suffix
The suffix to initiate the conversion.
.It Ar type
A list of valid filetypes for the conversion.
Valid types are:
.Sq f
(file), and
.Sq d
(directory).
.It Ar disable
The name of file that will prevent conversion if it exists.
A filename of
.Dq Pa \&.
will prevent this disabling action
(i.e., the conversion is always permitted.)
.It Ar command
The command to run for the conversion.
The first word should be the full path name
of the command, as
.Xr execv 3
is used to execute the command.
All instances of the word
.Dq %s
in
.Ar command
are replaced with the requested file (sans
.Ar suffix ) .
.El
.Pp
Conversion directives specified later in the file override earlier
conversions with the same suffix.
.It Sy display Ar class Op Ar file
If
.Ar file
is not given or
.Ar class
is
.Dq none ,
disable this.
Otherwise, each time the user enters a new directory, check if
.Ar file
exists, and if so, display its contents to the user.
Escape sequences are supported; refer to
.Sx Display file escape sequences
in 
.Xr ftpd 8
for more information.
.It Sy maxtimeout Ar class Ar time
Set the maximum timeout period that a client may request,
defaulting to two hours.
This cannot be less than 30 seconds, or the value for
.Sy timeout .
Ignored if class is
.Dq none
or
.Ar time
is not specified.
.It Sy modify Ar class Op Sy off
If class is
.Dq none
or
.Sy off
is given, disable the following commands:
CHMOD, DELE, MKD, RMD, RNFR, and UMASK.
Otherwise, enable them.
.It Sy motd Ar class Op Ar file
If
.Ar file
is not given or
.Ar class
is
.Dq none ,
disable this.
Otherwise, use
.Ar file
as the message of the day file to display after login.
Escape sequences are supported; refer to
.Sx Display file escape sequences
in 
.Xr ftpd 8
for more information.
.It Sy notify Ar class Op Ar fileglob
If
.Ar fileglob
is not given or
.Ar class
is
.Dq none ,
disable this.
Otherwise, each time the user enters a new directory,
notify the user of any files matching
.Ar fileglob .
.It Sy passive Ar class Op Sy off
If class is
.Dq none
or
.Sy off
is given, disallow passive (PASV/LPSV/EPSV) connections.
Otherwise, enable them.
.It Sy rateget Ar rate
Set the maximum get (RETR) transfer rate throttle to
.Ar rate .
If
.Ar rate
is 0, the throttle is disabled.
.Pp
An optional suffix may be provided, which changes the intrepretation of 
.Ar rate
as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 3n -offset indent -compact
.It b
Causes no modification. (Optional)
.It k
Kilo; multiply the argument by 1024
.It m
Mega; multiply the argument by 1048576
.It g
Giga; multiply the argument by 1073741824
.El
.It Sy rateput Ar class
Set the maximum put (STOR) transfer rate throttle to
.Ar rate ,
which is parsed as per
.Sy rateget Ar rate .
.It Sy timeout Ar class Ar time
Set the inactivity timeout period.
(the default is fifteen minutes).
This cannot be less than 30 seconds, or greater than the value for
.Sy maxtimeout .
Ignored if class is
.Dq none
or
.Ar time
is not specified.
.It Sy umask Ar class Ar umaskval
Set the umask to
.Ar umaskval .
Ignored if class is
.Dq none
or
.Ar umaskval
is not specified.
.It Sy upload Ar class Op Sy off
If class is
.Dq none
or
.Sy off
is given, disable the following commands:
APPE, STOR, and STOU,
as well as the modify commands:
CHMOD, DELE, MKD, RMD, RNFR, and UMASK.
Otherwise, enable them.
