/*
 * Here we define the NetBSD OS Version and emulation name in two
 * NetBSD ELF .note sections, which are structured like:
 *
 * [NOTE HEADER]
 *	long		name size
 *	long		description size
 *	long		note type
 *
 * [NOTE DATUM]
 *	string		OS name
 *
 * OSVERSION notes also have:
 *	long		OS version (NetBSD constant from param.h)
 *
 * EMULNAME notes also have:
 *	string		OS emulation name (netbsd == native)
 *
 * The DATUM fields should be padded out such that their actual (not
 * declared) sizes % 4 == 0.
 *
 * These are (not yet!) used by the kernel to determine if this binary
 * is really a NetBSD binary, or some other OS's.
