	 *	.
	 *	. 12 bytes
	 *	.
	 *	etc.
	 *
	 * The old-format entries look like (displacements filled in
	 * by the linker):
	 *
	 *	ldah	$28, 0($31)		# 0x279f0000
	 *	lda	$28, 0($28)		# 0x239c0000

	 *
	 *	br	$28, plt0		# 0xc3800000
	 *					# 0x00000000
	 *					# 0x00000000
	 *
	 * What we do is fetch the first PLT entry and check to
	 * see the first word of it matches the first word of the
	 * old format.  If so, we use a binding routine that can
	 * handle the old format, otherwise we use a binding routine
	 * that handles the new format.
	 *
	 * Note that this is done on a per-object basis, we can mix
	 * and match shared objects build with both the old and new
	 * linker.
