.Sh NAME
.Nm p2k
.Nd puffs to kernel vfs translation library
.Sh LIBRARY
p2k Library (libp2k, \-lp2k)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In rump/p2k.h
.Ft int
.Fo p2k_run_fs
.Fa "const char *vfsname" "const char *devpath" "const char *mountpath"
.Fa "int mntflags" "void *arg" "size_t alen" "uint32_t puffs_flags"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library translates the puffs protocol to the kernel vfs protocol and
back again.
It can therefore be used to mount and run kernel file system code as
a userspace daemon.
.Pp
Calling the library interface function mounts the file system and,
if succesful, starts handling requests.
The parameters are handled by
.Fn ukfs_mount
(see
.Xr ukfs 3 ) ,
with the exception that
.Fa mountpath
and
.Fa puffs_flags
are handled by
.Xr puffs 3 .
