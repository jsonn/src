.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions compute the complex arc tangent of \fIz\fP,
with branch cuts outside the interval
[-\fIi\fP,\ +\fIi\fP] along the imaginary axis.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
These functions return the complex arc tangent value, in the
range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the imaginary
axis and in the interval [-pi/2,\ +pi/2] along the
real axis.
