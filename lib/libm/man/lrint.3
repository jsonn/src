.Sh NAME
.Nm llrint ,
.Nm llrintf ,
.Nm lrint ,
.Nm lrintf
.Nd convert to integer
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft long long
.Fn llrint "double x"
.Ft long long
.Fn llrintf "float x"
.Ft long
.Fn lrint "double x"
.Ft long
.Fn lrintf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn lrint
function returns the integer nearest to its argument
.Fa x
according to the current rounding mode.
.Pp
The
.Fn llrint ,
.Fn llrintf ,
and
.Fn lrintf
functions differ from
.Fn lrint
only in their input and output types.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm llrint ,
.Nm llrintf ,
.Nm lrint ,
and
.Nm lrintf
functions return the integer nearest to their argument
.Fa x
according to the current rounding mode.
If the rounded result is too large to be represented as a
.Vt long long
or
.Vt long
value, respectively,
.\" an invalid exception is raised and
the return value is undefined.
.\" Otherwise, if
.\" .Fa x
.\" is not an integer,
.\" .Fn lrint
.\" raises an inexact exception.
.\" If
.\" .Fa x
.\" is too large, a range error may occur.
