is passed a command that is greater than MAX_COMMAND then the command
passed is assumed to be a user defined command and 
.Fn menu_driver
returns E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND.  Otherwise if the command is a printable
character then the character represented by the command is placed at
the end of the pattern buffer and an attempt is made to match the
pattern buffer against the items in the menu.
