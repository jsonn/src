.Sh NAME
.Nm ossaudio
.Nd OSS audio emulation
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libossaudio
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In soundcard.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an emulation of the OSS (Linux) audio
interface.
.Pp
Use the native interface for new programs and the emulation
library only for porting programs.
.Ss Mixer Control Map
The following table summarizes the mappings from native interface
device names to OSS mixer controls.
.Pp
.Bl -column ".Sy Native Device Name" "SOUND_MIXER_SPEAKER"
.It Sy "Native Device Name" Ta Sy "OSS Mixer Control"
.It *.mic Ta SOUND_MIXER_MIC
.It *.line Ta SOUND_MIXER_LINE
.It *.cd Ta SOUND_MIXER_CD
.It *.dac Ta SOUND_MIXER_PCM
.It *.aux Ta SOUND_MIXER_LINE1
.It *.record Ta SOUND_MIXER_IMIX
.It *.master Ta SOUND_MIXER_VOLUME
.It *.treble Ta SOUND_MIXER_TREBLE
.It *.bass Ta SOUND_MIXER_BASS
.It *.speaker Ta SOUND_MIXER_SPEAKER
.It *.output Ta SOUND_MIXER_OGAIN
.It *.input Ta SOUND_MIXER_IGAIN
.It *.fmsynth Ta SOUND_MIXER_SYNTH
.It *.midi Ta SOUND_MIXER_SYNTH
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr midi 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh BUGS
The emulation uses a #define for
.Fn ioctl
so some obscure programs
can fail to compile.
.Pp
The emulation is incomplete.
.Pp
The emulation only covers
.Fn ioctl ,
there are other differences as well.
E.g., on a write
that would block in non-blocking mode Linux returns
.Dv EINTR
whereas
.Nx 1.3
returns
.Dv EAGAIN .
