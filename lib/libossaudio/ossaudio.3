.Sh NAME
.Nm ossaudio
.Nd OSS audio emulation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <soundcard.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an emulation of the OSS (Linux) audio
interface.
.Pp
Use the native interface for new programs and the emulation
library only for porting programs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4
.Sh BUGS
The emulation uses an #define for 
.Va ioctl()
so some obscure programs
can fail to compile.
.Pp
The emulation is incomplete.
.Pp
The emulation only covers 
.Va ioctl() ,
there are other differences as well.  E.g., on a write
that would block in non-blocking mode Linux returns
.Dv EINTR
whereas
.Nx 1.3
returns
.Dv EWOULDBLOCK .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
