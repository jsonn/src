.Sh NAME
.Nm pw_lock ,
.Nm pw_mkdb ,
.Nm pw_abort
.Nd passwd file update functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <util.h>
.Ft int
.Fn pw_lock "int retries"
.Ft int
.Fn pw_mkdb
.Ft void
.Fn pw_abort
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pw_lock ,
.Fn pw_mkdb ,
and
.Fn pw_abort
functions allow a program to update the system passwd database.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_lock
function attempts to lock the passwd database by creating the file
.Pa /etc/ptmp ,
and returns the file descriptor of that file.  If
.Fa retries
is greater than zero,
.Fn pw_lock
will try multiple times to open
.Pa /etc/ptmp ,
waiting one second between tries.  In addition to being a lock file,
.Pa /etc/ptmp
will also hold the contents of the new passwd file.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_mkdb
function updates the passwd file from the contents of
.Pa /etc/ptmp .
You should finish writing to and close the file descriptor returned by
.Fn pw_lock
before calling
.Fn pw_mkdb .
If
.Fn pw_mkdb
fails and you do not wish to retry, you should make sure to call
.Fn pw_abort
to clean up the lock file.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_abort
function aborts a passwd file update by deleting
.Pa /etc/ptmp .
The passwd database remains unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pw_lock
and
.Fn pw_mkdb
functions return -1 if they are unable to complete properly.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/master.passwd -compact
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
