.Lb libutil
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In util.h
.Ft void
.Fn pw_getconf "char *data" "size_t len" "const char *key" "const char *option"
.Ft void
.Fn pw_getpwconf "char *data" "size_t len" "const struct passwd *pwd" "const char *option"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pw_getconf
function reads
.Pa /etc/passwd.conf
and retrieves the value of the option specified
by
.Pa option
from the section given by
.Pa key .
If no suitable entry is found
for the
.Pa key
an empty string will be returned in data.
.Pp
To retrieve default values the key
.Pa default
can be used.
In this case, if
.Pa /etc/passwd.conf
does not exist or does not contain a
.Pa default
section, the built-in defaults will be returned.
They are as follows:
.Bl -column localcipher data -offset indent
.It Sy option	data
.It ypcipher	old
.It localcipher	old
.El
.Pp
An empty string is returned for all errors.
.Pp
.Nm pw_getpwconf
returns the value for the option specified for the particular user
specified in
.Ar pwd .
If that option is not found, then it tries to find the option in
the primary group of that user, and if that fails, then it returns
the default entry.
