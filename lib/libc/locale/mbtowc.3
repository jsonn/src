.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]stdlib.h\*[Gt]
.Ft int
.Fn mbtowc "wchar_t * restrict pwc" "const char * restrict s" "size_t n"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mbtowc
usually converts the multibyte character pointed by
.Fa s
to the wide character, and store it to the wchar_t object pointed by
.Fa pwc
if
.Fa pwc
is non-null and
.Fa s
points a valid character.
This function may inspect at most n bytes of the array beginning from
.Fa s .
.Pp
In state-dependent encodings,
.Fa s
may point the special sequence bytes to change the shift-state.
Although such sequence bytes corresponds to no individual
wide-character code,
the
.Fn mbtowc
changes its own state by the sequence bytes and treats them
as if they are a part of the subsequence multibyte character.
.Pp
Unlike
.Xr mbrtowc 3 ,
the first
.Fa n
bytes pointed by
.Fa s
need to form an entire multibyte character.
Otherwise, this function causes an error.
.Pp
Calling any other functions in the
.Lb libc
never change the internal
state of the
.Fn mbtowc ,
except for calling
.Xr setlocale 3
with changing LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
Such
.Xr setlocale 3
call causes the internal state of this function to be indeterminate.
.Pp
The behaviour of the
.Fn mbtowc
is affected by LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
.Pp
There are special cases:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It s == NULL
.Fn mbtowc
initializes its own internal state to an initial state, and
determines whether the current encoding is state-dependent.
This function returns 0 if the encoding is state-independent,
otherwise non-zero.
In this case,
.Fa pwc
is completely ignored.
.It pwc == NULL
.Fn mbtowc
executes the conversion as if
.Fa pwc
is non-null, but a result of the conversion is discarded.
.It n == 0
In this case,
the first
.Fa n
bytes of the array pointed by
.Fa s
never form a complete character.
Thus, the
.Fn mbtowc
always fails.
.El
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
In the usual cases, the
.Fn mbtowc
returns:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It 0
.Fa s
points a null byte (\'\\0\').
.It positive
number of bytes for the valid multibyte character pointed by
.Fa s .
There is no cases that the value returned is greater than
the value of MB_CUR_MAX macro.
.It -1
.Fa s
points an invalid or an incomplete multibyte character.
The
.Fn mbtowc
also sets errno to indicate the error.
.El
.Pp
In the case that
.Fa s
is equal to NULL, the
.Fn mbtowc
returns:
.Bl -tag -width 0123456789
.It 0
The current encoding is state-independent.
.It non-zero
The current encoding is state-dependent.
.El

.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn mbtowc
may causes an error in the following case:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
.Fa s
points an invalid or incomplete multibyte character.

.Sh STANDARDS
The

function conforms to

The restrict qualifier is added at
.St -isoC99 .
