.Sh NAME
.Nm isnormal
.Nd test for normal value
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft int
.Fn isnormal "real-floating x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isnormal
macro determines whether its argument
.Fa x
has a normal value.
An argument represented in a format wider than its semantic type is
converted to its semantic type first.
The determination is then based on the type of the argument.
.Ss IEEE 754
It is determined whether the value of
.Fa x
is normal, and neither zero, subnormal, infinite nor NaN.
.Ss VAX
It is determined whether the value of
.Fa x
is finite, and neither true zero, dirty zero nor ROP.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn isnormal
macro returns a non-zero value if the value of
.Fa x
is finite.
Otherwise 0 is returned.
.Sh ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr isfinite 3 ,
.Xr math 3 ,
.Xr signbit 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isnormal
macro conforms to
.St -isoC-99 .
