.Dt ULIMIT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ulimit
.Nd get and set process limits
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <ulimit.h>
.Ft long int
.Fn ulimit "int cmd" ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ulimit
function provides a method to query or alter resource limits of the calling
process.  The method to be performed is specified by the
.Fa cmd
argument; possible values are:
.Bl -tag -width UL_GETFSIZEXX
.It Li UL_GETFSIZE
Return the soft file size limit of the process.
The value returned is in units of 512-byte blocks.
If the result cannot be represented in an object of type
.Fa long int ,
the result is unspecified.
.It Li UL_SETFSIZE
Set the hard and soft file size limits of the process to the value of the
second argument passed, which is in units of 512-byte blocks, and which is
expected to be of type
.Fa long int .
The new file size limit of the process is returned.
Any process may decrease the limit, but raising it is only permitted if
the caller is the super-user.
.El
.Pp
If successful, the
.Fn ulimit
function will not change the setting of
.Va errno .
.Pp
The
.Fn ulimit
function is an obsolete interface; applications are encouraged to use
.Xr getrlimit 2
and
.Xr setrlimit 2
instead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn ulimit
function returns the value of the requested limit.
Otherwise, it returns -1, sets
.Va errno
to indicate an error, and the limit is not changed.
Therefore, to detect an error condition applications should set
.Va errno
to 0, call
.Fn ulimit ,
and check if -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is non-zero.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn ulimit
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa cmd
argument is not valid.
.It Bq Er EPERM
It was attempted to increase a limit, and the caller is not the super-user.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getrlimit 2 ,
.Xr setrlimit 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn ulimit
function conforms to
.St -xsh5 .
