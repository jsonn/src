.Dt SIGSET 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sigset
.Nd manipulate signal dispositions
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In signal.h
.\" The following is Quite Ugly, but syntactically correct.  Don't try to
.\" fix it.
.Ft void \*(lp*
.Fn sigset "int sig" "void \*(lp*disp\*(rp\*(lpint\*(rp\*(rp\*(rp\*(lpint"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is made obsolete by
.Xr sigaction 2
and
.Xr sigprocmask 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn sigset
function manipulates the disposition of the signal
.Fa sig .
The new disposition is given in
.Fa disp .
.Pp
If
.Fa disp
is one of
.Dv SIG_DFL ,
.Dv SIG_IGN ,
or the address of a handler function,
the disposition of
.Fa sig
is changed accordingly, and
.Fa sig
is removed from the process' signal mask.
Also, if
.Fa disp
is the address of a handler function,
.Fa sig
will be added to the process' signal mask during execution of the handler.
.Pp
If
.Fa disp
is equal to
.Dv SIG_HOLD ,
.Fa sig
is added to the calling process' signal mask and the disposition of
.Fa sig
remains unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn sigset
function returns
.Dv SIG_HOLD
if
.Fa sig
had been blocked,
and the previous disposition of
.Fa sig
if it had not been blocked.
Otherwise
.Dv SIG_ERR
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn sigset
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Fa sig
is not a valid signal number.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
An attempt is made to ignore a signal that cannot be ignored,
such as
.Dv SIGKILL
or
.Dv SIGSTOP .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sigaction 2 ,
.Xr sigprocmask 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn sigset
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
