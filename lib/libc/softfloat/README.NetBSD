This is a modified version of part of John Hauser's SoftFloat 2a package.
This version has been heavily modified to support its use with GCC to
implement built-in floating-point operations, but compiling
softfloat.c without SOFTFLOAT_FOR_GCC defined should get you the same
results as from the original.
