.Sh NAME
.Nm statfs ,
.Nm fstatfs
.Nd get file system statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Ft int
.Fn statfs "const char *path" "struct statfs *buf"
.Ft int
.Fn fstatfs "int fd" "struct statfs *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Statfs
returns information about a mounted file system.
.Fa Path
is the path name of any file within the mounted file system.
.Fa Buf
is a pointer to a
.Nm statfs
structure defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct { int32_t val[2]; } fsid_t;

#define MFSNAMELEN   16 /* length of fs type name, including nul */
#define MNAMELEN     32	/* length of buffer for returned name */

struct statfs {
    short   f_type;	/* type of file system (unused; zero) */
    short   f_flags;	/* copy of mount flags */
    long    f_bsize;	/* fundamental file system block size */
    long    f_iosize;	/* optimal transfer block size */
    long    f_blocks;	/* total data blocks in file system */
    long    f_bfree;	/* free blocks in fs */
    long    f_bavail;	/* free blocks avail to non-superuser */
    long    f_files;	/* total file nodes in file system */
    long    f_ffree;	/* free file nodes in fs */
    fsid_t  f_fsid;	/* file system id */
    uid_t   f_owner;	/* user that mounted the file system */
    long    f_spare[4];	/* spare for later */
    char    f_fstypename[MFSNAMELEN]; /* fs type name */
    char    f_mntonname[MNAMELEN];    /* directory on which mounted */
    char    f_mntfromname[MNAMELEN];  /* mounted file system */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Fields that are undefined for a particular file system are set to -1.
.Fn Fstatfs
returns the same information about an open file referenced by descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Statfs
fails if one or more of the following are true:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix of
.Fa Path
is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The length of a component of
.Fa path
exceeds 
.Dv {NAME_MAX}
characters, or the length of
.Fa path
exceeds 
.Dv {PATH_MAX}
characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The file referred to by
.Fa path
does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of
.Fa path .
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
.Fa path .
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa Buf
or
.Fa path
points to an invalid address.
.It Bq Er EIO
An
.Tn I/O
error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
.El
.Pp
