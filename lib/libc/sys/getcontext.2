.Dt GETCONTEXT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getcontext ,
.Nm setcontext
.Nd get and set current user context
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <ucontext.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getcontext "ucontext_t *ucp"
.Ft int
.Fn setcontext "const ucontext_t *ucp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getcontext
function initializes the object pointed to by
.Fa ucp
to the current user context of the calling thread.
The user context defines a thread's execution environment and includes
the contents of its machine registers,
its signal mask,
and its current execution stack.
.Pp
The
.Fn setcontext
restores the user context defined in the object pointed to by
.Fa ucp
as most recently initialized by a previous call to either
.Fn getcontext
or
.Xr makecontext(3) .
.\" TODO: signal handler
If successful, execution of the program resumes as defined in the
.Fa ucp
argument, and
.Fn setcontext
will not return.
If
.Fa ucp
was initialized by the
.Fn getcontext
function, program execution continues as if the curresponding invocation of
.Fn getcontext
had just returned (successfully).
If
.Fa ucp
was initialized by the
.Xr makecontext 3
function, program execution continues with the function (and function
arguments) passed to
.Xr makecontext 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful completion,
.Fn getcontext
returns 0 and
.Fn setcontext
does not return.
Otherwise a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn getcontext
and
.Fn setcontext
functions will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The
.Fa ucp
argument points to an invalid address.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn setcontext
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The contents of the datum pointed to by
.Fa ucp
are invalid.
.El

.Xr longjmp 3 ,
.Xr setjmp 3 ,
.Xr makecontext 3 ,
.Xr swapcontext 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn getcontext
and
.Fn setcontext
functions conform to
.St -xsh5 .
The
.Va errno
indications are an extension to the standard.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getcontext
and
.Fn setcontext
functions first appeared in
.At V.4 .
