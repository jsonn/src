.Dt MMAP 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mmap
.Nd map files or devices into memory
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/mman.h>
.Ft void *
.Fn mmap "void *addr" "size_t len" "int prot" "int flags" "int fd" "off_t offset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mmap
function causes the pages starting at
.Fa addr
and continuing for at most
.Fa len
bytes to be mapped from the object described by
.Fa fd ,
starting at byte offset
.Fa offset .
If
.Fa len
is not a multiple of the pagesize, the mapped region may extend past the
specified range.
Any such extension beyond the end of the mapped object will be zero-filled.
.Pp
If
.Fa addr
is non-zero, it is used as a hint to the system.
(As a convenience to the system, the actual address of the region may differ
from the address supplied.)
If
.Fa addr
is zero, an address will be selected by the system.
The actual starting address of the region is returned.
A successful
.Fa mmap
deletes any previous mapping in the allocated address range.
.Pp
The protections (region accessibility) are specified in the
.Fa prot
argument by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width MAP_FIXEDX
.It Dv PROT_EXEC
Pages may be executed.
.It Dv PROT_READ
Pages may be read.
.It Dv PROT_WRITE
Pages may be written.
.It Dv PROT_NONE
Pages may not be accessed.
.El
.Pp
.Bf -symbolic
Note that, due to hardware limitations, on some platforms
.Dv PROT_WRITE
may imply
.Dv PROT_READ ,
and
.Dv PROT_READ
may imply
.Dv PROT_EXEC .
Portable programs should not rely on these flags being separately
enforcable.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
parameter specifies the type of the mapped object, mapping options and
whether modifications made to the mapped copy of the page are private
to the process or are to be shared with other references.
Note that either
.Dv MAP_SHARED ,
.Dv MAP_PRIVATE
or
.Dv MAP_COPY
must be specified.
Sharing, mapping type and options are specified in the
.Fa flags
argument by
.Em or Ns 'ing
the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width MAP_FIXEDX
.It Dv MAP_ANON
Map anonymous memory not associated with any specific file.
The file descriptor used for creating
.Dv MAP_ANON
regions is used only for
naming, and may be specified as \-1 if no name is associated with the
region.
.It Dv MAP_FILE
Mapped from a regular file or character-special device memory.
.It Dv MAP_FIXED
Do not permit the system to select a different address than the one
specified.
If the specified address cannot be used,
.Nm mmap
will fail.
If MAP_FIXED is specified,
.Fa addr
must be a multiple of the pagesize.
Use of this option is discouraged.
.It Dv MAP_HASSEMAPHORE
Notify the kernel that the region may contain semaphores and that special
handling may be necessary.
.It Dv MAP_INHERIT
Permit regions to be inherited across
.Xr execve 2
system calls.
.It Dv MAP_PRIVATE
Modifications made by this process are private, however modifications made by
other processes using
.Dv MAP_SHARED
will be seen.
.It Dv MAP_SHARED
Modifications are shared.
.It Dv MAP_COPY
Modifications are private, including other processes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr close 2
function does not unmap pages, see
.Xr munmap 2
for further information.
.Pp
The current design does not allow a process to specify the location of
swap space.
In the future we may define an additional mapping type,
.Dv MAP_SWAP ,
in which
the file descriptor argument specifies a file or device to which swapping
should be done.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Nm mmap
returns a pointer to the mapped region.
Otherwise, a value of
.Dv MAP_FAILED
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
The symbol
.Dv MAP_FAILED
is defined in the header
.Ao Pa sys/mman.h Ac .
No successful return from
.Fn mmap
will return the value
.Dv MAP_FAILED .
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn mmap
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
The flag
.Dv PROT_READ
was specified as part of the
.Fa prot
parameter and
.Fa fd
was not open for reading.
The flags
.Dv MAP_SHARED
and
.Dv PROT_WRITE
were specified as part of the
.Fa flags
and
.Fa prot
parameters and
.Fa fd
was not open for writing.
.It Bq Er EBADF
.Fa fd
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.\"One of
.\".Dv MAP_ANON
.\"or
.\".Dv MAP_FILE
.\"was not specified as part of the
.\".Fa flags
.\"parameter.
.Dv MAP_FIXED
was specified and the
.Fa addr
parameter was not page aligned or was outside of the
valid address range for a process.
.Dv MAP_ANON was specified and
.Fa fd
was not \-1.
.Fa len
was less than zero.
.It Bq Er ENODEV
.Fa fd
did not reference a regular or character special file.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
.Dv MAP_FIXED
was specified and the
.Fa addr
parameter wasn't available.
.Dv MAP_ANON
was specified and insufficient memory was available.
.It Bq Er EOVERFLOW
.Fa fd
references a regular file and the value of
.Fa offset
plus
.Fa len
would exceed the offset maximum established in its open file description.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Dv MAP_COPY
flag is not implemented.  The current
.Dv MAP_COPY
semantics are the same as those of the
.Dv MAP_PRIVATE
flag.
