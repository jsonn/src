.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn sa_setconcurrency
is used to increase the number of scheduler activation virtual processors
used by the process.
.Fn sa_setconcurrency
increases the number of virtual processors, i.e., execution concurrency,
up to
.Fa concurrency .
However,
.Fn sa_setconcurrency
won't try to allocate more virtual processors than there are physical
processors on the system.
.Pp
Scheduler activation should be enabled by
.Fn sa_enable
beforehand.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success,
.Fn sa_setconcurrency
returns the number of newly added virtual processors.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
