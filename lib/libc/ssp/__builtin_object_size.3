.Sh NAME
.Nm __builtin_object_size
.Nd return the size of the given object
.Sh LIBRARY
.Ft size_t
.Fn __builtin_object_size "void *ptr" "int type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn __builtin_object_size
function is a
.Xr gcc 1
built-in function that returns the size of the
.Fa ptr
object if known at compile time and the object does not have any side
effects.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the size of the object is not known or it has side effects the
.Fn __builtin_object_size
function returns:
.Bl -tag -width (size_t)-1
.It Dv (size_t)-1
for
.Fa type
.Dv 0
and
.Dv 1 .
.It Dv (size_t)0
for
.Fa type
.Dv 2
and
.Dv 3 .
.El
.Pp
If the size of the object is known, then the
.Fn __builtin_object_size
function returns the maximum size of all the objects that the compiler
knows that they can be pointed to by
.Fa ptr
when
.Fa type
.Dv & 2 == 0 ,
and the minimum size when
.Fa type
.Dv & 2 != 0 .

.Xr ssp 3 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
