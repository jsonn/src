/*
 * Requirements:
 * 
 * 1. The thread safe mechanism should be lightweight so the library can
 *    be used by non-threaded applications without unreasonable overhead.
 * 
 * 2. There should be no dependency on a thread engine for non-threaded
 *    applications.
 * 
 * 3. There should be no dependency on any particular thread engine.
 * 
 * 4. The library should be able to be compiled without support for thread
 *    safety.
 * 
 * 
 * Rationale:
 * 
 * One approach for thread safety is to provide discrete versions of the
 * library: one thread safe, the other not.  The disadvantage of this is
 * that libc is rather large, and two copies of a library which are 99%+
 * identical is not an efficent use of resources.
 * 
 * Another approach is to provide a single thread safe library.  However,
 * it should not add significant run time or code size overhead to non-
 * threaded applications.
 * 
 * Since the NetBSD C library is used in other projects, it should be
 * easy to replace the mutual exclusion primitives with ones provided by
 * another system.  Similarly, it should also be easy to remove all
 * support for thread safety completely if the target environment does
 * not support threads.
 * 
 * 
 * Implementation Details:
 * 
 * The mutex primitives used by the library (mutex_t, mutex_lock, etc.)
 * are macros which expand to the cooresponding primitives provided by
 * the thread engine or to nothing.  The latter is used so that code is
 * not unreasonably cluttered with #ifdefs when all thread safe support
 * is removed.
 * 
 * The mutex macros can be directly mapped to the mutex primitives from
 * pthreads, however it should be reasonably easy to wrap another mutex
 * implementation so it presents a similar interface.
 * 
 * Stub implementations of the mutex functions are provided with *weak*
 * linkage.  These functions simply return success.  When linked with a
 * thread library (i.e. -lpthread), the functions will override the
 * stubs.
