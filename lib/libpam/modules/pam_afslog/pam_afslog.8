.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_afslog
.Nd AFS credentials PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_afslog
.Op Ar arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
authentication service module for PAM provides functionality for
only one PAM category: authentication
.Ar ( module-type
of
.Dq Li auth ) .
.Pp
The
.Fn pam_sm_authenticate
function does nothing and thus the module should be used with an
.Ar control-flag
of
.Dq Li optional .
.Pp
The value of the module comes from its
.Fn pam_sm_setcred
function.
If the
.Ar afslog
parameter is enabled in
.Xr krb5.conf 5 ,
then the module will take Kerberos 5 credentials from the cache
created by
.Xr pam_krb5 8
and convert them into AFS tokens, after first creating a PAG (Process
Authentication Group) if necessary.

.Sh HISTORY
