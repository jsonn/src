.Sh NAME
.Nm curses_default_colors ,
.Nm assume_default_colors ,
.Nm use_default_colors
.Nd curses default colors setting routines
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libcurses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In curses.h
.Ft int
.Fn assume_default_colors "short fore" "short back"
.Ft int
.Fn use_default_colors ""
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions tell the curses library to set the default colors or to use
the terminal's default colors instead of using the default colors for curses
applications (which are white foreground on black background).
.Pp
The function
.Fn assume_default_colors fore back
sets the default colors to foreground color
.Fa fore
and background color
.Fa back .
If a value of \-1 is used for a color, then the terminal default color is used
for that color.
.Pp
The function
.Fn use_default_colors
sets both the foreground and background colors to the terminal default colors.
This is equivalent to
.Fn assume_default_colors \-1 \-1 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return OK on success and ERR on failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr curses_color 3
.Sh STANDARDS
These functions are based on
.Em ncurses
extensions to the curses standards.
.Sh HISTORY
These functions first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
