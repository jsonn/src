.Sh STANDARDS

conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Applications using spinlocks are vulnerable to the effects of priority
inversion.
Applications using real-time threads
.Pq Dv SCHED_FIFO , SCHED_RR
should not use these interfaces.
Outside carefully controlled environments, priority inversion with spinlocks
can lead to system deadlock.
Mutexes are preferable in nearly every possible use case.
