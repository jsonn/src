	 * ...
	 * [*] That is, unfortunately, not what the standard

	 * they say what they say, not what they were intended to
	 * say. Somehow, an error crept in, and the sentence
	 * specifying that "the implementation clears the
	 * thread-specific data value before calling the destructor"
	 * was deleted. Nobody noticed, and the standard was approved
	 * with the error. So the standard says (by omission) that if
	 * you want to write a portable application using
	 * thread-specific data, that will not hang on thread
	 * termination, you must call pthread_setspecific within your
	 * destructor function to change the value to NULL. This would
	 * be silly, and any serious implementation of Pthreads will
	 * violate the standard in this respect. Of course, the
	 * standard will be fixed, probably by the 1003.1n amendment
	 * (assorted corrections to 1003.1c-1995), but that will take
	 * a while.''
