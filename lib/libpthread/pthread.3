.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread
.Nd POSIX Threads Library
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpthread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Pp
.Nm cc
.Op Ar flags
.Ar files
.Fl lpthread
.Op Ar libraries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an implementation of the standard
.Tn POSIX
threads framework.
.Pp
Note that the system private thread interfaces upon which the
.Nm
library is built are subject to change without notice.
In order to remain compatible with future
.Nx
releases, programs must be linked against the dynamic version of the
thread library.
Statically linked programs using the
.Tn POSIX
threads framework may not work when run on a future version of the system.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PTHREAD_DEBUGCOUNTERSXX
.It Ev PTHREAD_CONCURRENCY
The current version of the system does not inspect this variable.
It is reserved for use by the
.Nm
library.
.It Ev PTHREAD_DIAGASSERT
Possible values are any combinations of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ignoreXX -offset indent -compact
.It Sy A
Report errors to application by error return, but do not abort.
.It Sy a
Abort on errors, creating a core dump for further debugging.
.It Sy E
Do not log errors to stdout.
.It Sy e
Log errors to stdout.
.It Sy L
Do not log errors via
.Xr syslogd 8 .
.It Sy l
Log errors via
.Xr syslogd 8 .
.El
.Pp
If not set in the environment, the
.Nm
library behaves as if
.Sy AEL
has been specified.
.It Ev PTHREAD_RRTIME
The current version of the system does not inspect this variable.
It is reserved for use by the
.Nm
library.
.It Ev PTHREAD_STACKSIZE
Integer value giving the stack size in kilobytes.
This allows to set a smaller stack size than the default stack size.
The default stack size is the current limit on the stack size as
set with the shell's command to change limits
.Ic ( limit
for
.Xr csh 1 ,
or
.Ic ulimit
for
.Xr sh 1 ) .

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
library conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Due to limitations in the current pthread implementation,
.Xr makecontext 3
and
.Xr sigaltstack 2
should not be used in programs which link against the
.Nm
library (whether threads are used or not).
