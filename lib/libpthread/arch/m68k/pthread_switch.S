/*
 * Utility macro to switch to the stack of another thread.
 * WARNING: This is more subtle than it looks.
 *
 * There are a couple of motivations for stack switching. One is that
 * when exiting an upcall and running a thread, we want to recycle the
 * state of the upcall before continuing the thread. However, the
 * stack is part of the upcall state, and we can't be on the upcall
 * stack when we want to recycle it. Therefore, we pre-switch to the
 * stack of the thread we're about to switch to and borrow some space
 * on its stack so that we can recycle the upcall.
 *
 * Another is that when performing the slightly sensitive operation of
 * putting the currently running thread on a (locked) sleep queue then
 * switching to another thread, we don't want to release the queue
 * lock until we are no longer on the original stack - if we released
 * it any earlier, it's possible (epecially on a multiprocessor
 * system) that the original thread could get taken off the queue and
 * restarted while we're still using its stack, which would be bad
 * ("Important saftey tip. Thanks, Egon").
 *
 * The subtlety comes from the contents of the stack of the thread
 * being switched to. Our convention is that the ucontext_t of the
 * thread is stored near the top of the stack. When the kernel
 * preempts a thread, it stores the ucontext_t just above the current
 * top-of-stack and passes the upcall handler the pointer to the
 * ucontext_t, and the upcall handler stores it in the the pt_uc field
 * of the thread structure. When user-level code voluntairly switches
 * from one thread to another, the ucontext_t is just below the top of
 * the stack, and we impose a limit on the amount of stack space above
 * the ucontext_t that may be used. This way, we can perform the stack
 * switch safely by setting the stack pointer to thread->pt_uc -
 * STACKSPACE.
 * Note carefully that we do the subtraction *before* putting the
 * value in the stack pointer. Since preemption can occur at any time,
 * and the kernel will happily write the new ucontext_t below the
 * current stack pointer, it is unsafe for us to ever set the stack
 * pointer above potentially valid data, even for one instruction.
 *
 * Got it? Good. Now go read it again.
