.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/atomic.h
.Ft uint32_t
.Fn atomic_swap_32 "volatile uint32_t *ptr" "uint32_t new"
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn atomic_swap_uint "volatile unsigned int *ptr" "unsigned int new"
.Ft unsigned long
.Fn atomic_swap_ulong "volatile unsigned long *ptr" "unsigned long new"
.Ft void *
.Fn atomic_swap_ptr "volatile void *ptr" "void *new"
.Ft uint64_t
.Fn atomic_swap_64 "volatile uint64_t *ptr" "uint64_t new"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm atomic_swap
family of functions perform a swap operation in an atomic fashion.
The value of the variable referenced by
.Fa ptr
is replaced by
.Fa new
and the old value returned.
.Pp
The 64-bit variants of these functions are available only on platforms
that can support atomic 64-bit memory access.
Applications can check for the availability of 64-bit atomic memory
operations by testing if the pre-processor macro
.Dv __HAVE_ATOMIC64_OPS
is defined.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atomic_ops 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm atomic_swap
functions first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
