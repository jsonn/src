# Note: The atomic operations here in these assembly files are atomic
# only with respect to regular memory on uniprocessor systems.  Since
# we don't support any MP m68k systems, this is just fine.  If we ever
# do, then these routines will probably need to be replaced with CAS-
# based routines (CAS generates an atomic bus cycle, whereas these
# others are merely single-instruction).
