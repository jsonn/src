.Sh NAME
.Nm slattach ,
.Nm slip
.Nd attach serial lines as network interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hm
.Op Fl s Ar baudrate
.Op Fl t Ar ldisc
.Ar ttyname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to assign a tty line to a network interface,
and to define the network source and destination addresses.
The following operands are supported by
.Nm "" :
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl h
Turn on RTS/CTS flow control.  By default, no flow control is done.
.It Fl H
Turn on DTR/CTS flow control.  By default, no flow control is done.
.It Fl m
Maintain modem control signals after closing the line.  Specifically,
this disables HUPCL.
.It Fl s Ar baudrate
Specifies the speed of the connection.  If not specified, the
default of 9600 is used.
.It Fl t Ar ldisc
Specifies the line discipline to use for the tty.  Supported line
disciplines are
.Dq slip
(creates a
.Xr sl 4
instance) and
.Dq strip
(creates a
.Xr strip 4
instance).
If this option is not specified, the default is
.Dq slip .
.It Ar ttyname
Specifies the name of the tty device.
.Ar Ttyname
should be a string of the form
.Ql ttyXX ,
or
.Ql /dev/ttyXX .
.El
.Pp
In addition, the following flags to
.Xr ifconfig 8
control various properties of a SLIP link:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar link0
Turn on Van Jacobsen header compression.
.It Ar -link0
Turn off header compression.
.It Ar link1
Don't pass through ICMP packets.
.It Ar -link1
Do pass through ICMP packets.
.It Ar link2
If a packet with a compressed header is received, automatically enable
compression of outgoing packets.
.It Ar -link2
Don't auto-enable compression.
.El
.Pp
Only the super-user may attach a network interface.
.Pp
To detach the interface, use
.Dq Li ifconfig interface-name down
after killing off the
.Nm
process.
.Ar Interface-name
is the name that is shown by
.Xr netstat 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
slattach ttyh8
slattach \-s 4800 /dev/tty01
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified interface does not exit, the
requested address is unknown, the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an interface's configuration.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netstat 1 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr sl 4 ,
.Xr strip 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr rc 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
