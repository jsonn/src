.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_isofs
.Nd mount an ISO-9660 filesystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_isofs
.Op Fl F Ar fsoptions
.Op Fl norrip
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_isofs
command attaches the ISO-9660 filesystem residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8 .
at boot time.
.Pp
If the filesystem includes Rockridge extensions, they are
used unless the
.Fl norrip
flag is used.  If that option is given to
.Nm
then the Rockridge extensions will be ignored.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
mount_isofs /dev/cd0d /cdrom
mount_isofs \-norrip /dev/cd0d /cdrom
mount \-t isofs /dev/cd0d /cdrom
mount \-t isofs \-o \-norrip /dev/cd0d /cdrom

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5
.Sh BUGS
The isofs filesystem should support the original "High Sierra"
("CDROM001") format;
it does not.
.Pp
POSIX device nodes are currently not supported.
.Pp
The filesystem name might need some rethinking, and some would
say it should run as a user process.
.Pp
There is no ECMA support.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mount_isofs
utility first appeared in NetBSD 0.8.
Handling of Rockridge extensions was added for NetBSD 0.9.
