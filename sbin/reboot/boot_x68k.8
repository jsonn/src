system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery.
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts.
The X68000/X68030 system boots from the device
which is determined by the configuration of
battery-backuped SRAM.
By default, the boot rom attempt to boot from
floppy disk drive (from 0 to 3) first,
and then attempt to boot from hard disk (SASI or SCSI).
On the NetBSD/X68k, booting from partition A of SCSI disks (sd?a) 
and 2HD floppy disks (fd?a, fd?c) is currently supported.
.Pp
First, the initial program loader of IOCS ROM or SCSI disk
(or equivalent) reads
.Pa boot
program at the top of the disk,
and then the boot program loads the NetBSD kernel
.Pa /netbsd
which is in the same partition of the disk.
If you press
.Pa [SHIFT]
key when booting, the boot program enables you to change
boot flag
.Dv RB_SINGLE
with the
.Pa [SHIFT]
key, and to choose which kernel
to be used with arrow keys.
If the LED of
.Pa [HIRAGANA]
key is turned on, the boot program adds
.Dv RB_KDB
flag and tries to boot the system in debug mode; see
.Xr ddb 8
for details.
.Pp
Note for X68030+MC68030 systems:
Nothing special to be attended to; you can boot NetBSD just like as
other operating systems such as Human68k and OS-9.
.Pp
Note for X68030/040turbo(68040 accelerator by BEEPs) systems:
NetBSD can boot under 040 mode.
It can also boot under 030 mode if you have MC68030 on the board.
.Pp
Note for X68000/Xellent30(68030 accelerator by TSR)+MC68030 systems:
In order to boot NetBSD, you must choose 030 mode by using
.Pa CH30.SYS ,
which must reside in the battery-backuped SRAM.
.Pp
Note for X68000/Jupiter-X(68040/060 accelerator by FTZ-net) systems:
The system must be in 040/060 processor mode.
