.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows a user or system administrator to issue commands to and otherwise
control SCSI devices and busses.  It is used by specifying a device or
bus to manipulate, the command to perform, and any arguments the command
may require.
.Nm
determines if the specified device is an actual device or a SCSI bus
automatically, and selects the appropriate command set.
.Pp
For commands which
.Nm
issues a SCSI command to the device directly, any returned sense information
will be decoded by
.Nm
and displayed to the standard output.
.Sh DEVICE COMMANDS
The following commands are supported for SCSI devices:
.Pp
.Nm format
.Pp
(Low level) format the named revice.
.Pp
.Nm identify
.Pp
Identify the specified device, displaying the device's SCSI
bus, target, and lun, as well as the device's vendor, product,
and revision strings.
.Pp
.Nm reassign
.Ar blkno
.Oo blkno Oo ...
.Oc
.Oc
.Pp
Issues a
.Li REASSIGN BLOCKS
command to the device, adding the specified blocks to the
grown defect list.  This command is only supported on
direct access devices.
.Pp
.Nm reset
.Pp
Reset the device.  This command is only supported for devices which
support the
.Li SCIOCRESET
ioctl.
.Sh BUS COMMANDS

.Pp
.Nm reset
.Pp
Reset the SCSI bus.  This command is only supported if the host adapter
supports the
.Li SCBUSIORESET
ioctl.
.Pp
.Nm scan
.Ar target
.Ar lun
.Pp
Scan the SCSI bus for devices.  This is useful if a device was not
connected or powered on when the system was booted.  The
.Ar target
and
.Ar lun
arguments specify which SCSI target and lun on the bus is to be scanned.
Either may be wildcarded by specifying the keyword
.Dq any
or
.Dq all .
