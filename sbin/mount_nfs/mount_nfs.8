.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm mount_nfs
command
calls the
.Xr mount 2
system call to prepare and graft a remote nfs file system (rhost:path)
on to the file system tree at the point
.Ar node.
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8 .
It implements the mount protocol as described in RFC 1094, Appendix A.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl D
Used with NQNFS to set the
.Dq "dead server threshold"
to the specified number of round trip timeout intervals.
After a
.Dq "dead server threshold"
of retransmit timeouts,
cached data for the unresponsive server is assumed to still be valid.
Values may be set in the range of 1 - 9, with 9 referring to an
.Dq "infinite dead threshold"
(i.e. never assume cached data still valid).
This option is not generally recommended and is really an experimental
feature.
.It Fl K
Pass Kerberos authenticators to the server for client-to-server
user-credential mapping.
This may only be used over TCP mounts between 4.4BSD clients and servers.
.It Fl L
Used with NQNFS to set the lease term to the specified number of seconds.
Only use this argument for mounts with a large round trip delay.
Values are normally in the 10-30 second range.
.It Fl M
Assume that other clients are not writing a file concurrently with this client.
This implements a slightly less strict consistency criteria than 4.3BSD-Reno
did, that is more in line with most commercial client implementations.
This is recommended for servers that do not support leasing.
.It Fl P
Use a reserved socket port number.
This is useful for mounting servers that require clients to use a
reserved port number.
.It Fl R
Set the retry count for doing the mount to the specified value.
.It Fl T
Use TCP transport instead of UDP.
This is recommended for servers that are not on the same LAN cable as
the client.
(NB: This is NOT supported by most non-BSD servers.)
.It Fl a
Set the read-ahead count to the specified value.
This may be in the range of 0 - 4, and determines how many blocks
will be read ahead when a large file is being read sequentially.
This is recommended for mounts with a large bandwidth * delay product.
.It Fl b
If an initial attempt to contact the server fails, fork off a child to keep
trying the mount in the background.
Useful for
.Xr fstab 5 ,
where the filesystem mount is not critical to multiuser operation.
.It Fl c
For UDP mount points, do not do a
.Xr connect 2 .
This must be used for servers that do not reply to requests from the
standard port number.
.It Fl d
Do not estimate retransmit timeout dynamically.
This may be useful for UDP mounts that exhibit high retry rates.
.It Fl g
Set the maximum size of the group list for the credentials to the
specified value.
This should be used for mounts on old servers that cannot handle a
group list size of 16, as specified in RFC 1057.
Try 8, if users in a lot of groups cannot get response from the mount
point.
.It Fl i
Make the mount interruptible, which implies that file system calls that
are delayed due to an unresponsive server will fail with EINTR when a
termination signal is posted for the process.
.It Fl k
Used with NQNFS to specify
.Dq get a lease
for the file name being looked up.
This is recommended unless the server is complaining about excessive
lease load.
.It Fl l
Used with NQNFS to specify that the \fBReaddir_and_Lookup\fR RPC should
be used.
This option reduces RPC traffic for cases such as
.Dq "ls -l" ,
but increases the lease load on the server.
This is recommended unless the server is complaining about excessive
lease load.
.It Fl m
Set the Kerberos realm to the string argument.
Used with the
.Fl K
option for mounts to other realms.
.It Fl o
Options are specified with a
.Fl o
flag followed by a comma separated string of options.
See the
.Xr mount 8
man page for possible options and their meanings.
.It Fl q
Use the leasing extensions to the protocol to maintain cache consistency.
This protocol, referred to as Not Quite Nfs (NQNFS),
is only supported by 4.4BSD servers.
.It Fl r
Set the read data size to the specified value.
It should be a power of 2 greater than or equal to 1024.
This should be used for UDP mounts when the
.Dq "fragments dropped due to timeout"
value is getting large while actively using a mount point.
(Use
.Xr netstat 1
with the
.Fl s
option to see what the
.Dq "fragments dropped due to timeout"
value is.)
See the
.Fl w
option as well.
.It Fl s
A soft mount, which implies that file system calls will fail
after \fBRetry\fR round trip timeout intervals.
.It Fl t
Set the initial retransmit timeout to the specified value.
May be useful for fine tuning UDP mounts over internetworks
with high packet loss rates or an overloaded server.
Try increasing the interval if
.Xr nfsstat 1
shows high retransmit rates while the file system is active or reducing the
value if there is a low retransmit rate but long response delay observed.
.It Fl w
Set the write data size to the specified value.
Ditto the comments w.r.t. the
.Fl r
option, but using the
.Dq "fragments dropped due to timeout"
value on the server instead of the client.
Note that both the
.Fl r
and
.Fl w
options should only be used as a last ditch effort at improving performance
when mounting servers that do not support TCP mounts.
.It Fl x
Set the retransmit timeout count for soft mounts to the specified value.

.Sh BUGS
Due to the way that Sun RPC is implemented on top of UDP (unreliable datagram)
transport, tuning such mounts is really a black art that can only be expected
to have limited success.
For clients mounting servers that are not on the same
LAN cable or that tend to be overloaded,
TCP transport is strongly recommended,
but unfortunately this is restricted to mostly 4.4BSD servers.
