.Op Fl c Ar raidlevel
.Op Fl H Ar channel:target[.lun]

.Sh DESCRIPTION
RAID device drivers which support management functionality can
register their services with the
.Xr bio 4
driver.
.Nm bioctl
then can be used to maintain RAID volumes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar alarm-function
Control the RAID card's alarm functionality, if supported.
.Ar alarm-function
may be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width disable -compact
.It Ar disable
Disable the alarm on the RAID controller.
.It Ar enable
Enable the alarm on the RAID controller.
.It Ar get
Retrieve the current alarm state (enabled or disabled).
.It Ar silence | Ar quiet
Silence the alarm if it is currently beeping.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar alarm-function
may be specified as given above,
or by the first letter only
(e.g. -a e).
.It Fl b Ar channel:target[.lun]
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
to start blinking, if there is
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Fl c Ar raidlevel
Create a
.Xr softraid 4
device of level
.Ar raidlevel .
The device must begin with
.Dq softraid
followed by a number.
.It Fl D
Enable debug output.
.It Fl H Ar channel:target[.lun]
If the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
is currently marked
.Dq Unused ,
promote it to being a
.Dq Hot Spare .
.It Fl h
Where necessary, produce "human-readable" output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to four or less.
.It Fl i
Enumerate the selected RAID devices.
.It Fl l Ar special[,special[,...]]
Use
.Ar special
device list to create within the
.Xr softraid 4
framework.
Requires
.Fl c .
.It Fl u Ar channel:target[.lun]
Instruct the device at
.Ar channel:target[.lun]
to cease blinking, if there is
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
support in the enclosure.
.It Fl v
Be more verbose in output.
.It Ar device
Select a drive by name (e.g. sd0) or a RAID controller by name (e.g. ami0).
For operations which will be performed against
.Xr ses 4
or
.Xr safte 4
enclosures, it is also possible to directly specify the enclosure name
(e.g. safte0).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command, executed from the command line, shows the status of
the logical drives on the RAID controller:
