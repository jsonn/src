 *      2) What attributes to set once a device is matched

 * Matching a device:   
 *      We can match a device by any one of these characteristics (starting
 * from specific ones, which may only be implemented by certain subsystems,
 * to the more generic ones which all devices will have).
 *       
 * Attributes:
 *      Once we've matched a rule to a device this section specifices the
 * attributes to set on this device node. For example, we can set the perms
 * and owner/group.
