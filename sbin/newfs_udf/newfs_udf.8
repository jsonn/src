.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_udf
.Nd construct a new UDF file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl F
.Op Fl L Ar loglabel
.Op Fl M
.Op Fl v Ar min_udf
.Op Fl V Ar max_udf
.Op Fl P Ar discid
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Op Fl S Ar setlabel
.Op Fl t Ar gmtoff
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility creates an UDF file system on device 
.Ar special 
suitable for the media currently inserted.
.Pp
The options are as follow:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Perform a crude surface check first to weed out disc faults on rewritable
media.
.It Fl F
Force file system construction on non-empty recordable media.
.It Fl L Ar loglabel
Set the disc logical label to the specified
.Ar loglabel .
.It Fl M
Disable metadata partition flavour selection.
.It Fl v Ar min_udf
Select
.Ar min_udf
as the minimum UDF version to be supported. Notation "0x201" for UDF version
2.01.
.It Fl V Ar max_udf
Select
.Ar max_udf
as the maximum UDF version to be supported. Notation "0x250" for UDF version
2.50.
.It Fl P Ar discid
Set the phyisical disc label to the specified
.Ar discid .
For strict conformance and interchange dont set this manually.
.It Fl s Ar size
Ignored for now.
.It Fl S Ar setlabel
Set the disc set label to the specified
.Ar setlabel .
For strict conformance and interchange dont set this manually.
.It Fl t Ar gmtoff
Use the specified
.Ar gmtoff
as gmt time offset for recording times on the disc.
.El
.Sh NOTES
The UDF file system is defined for the entire optical medium. It can only
function on the entire CD/DVD/BD so the raw partition has to be specified for
read/write actions. For
.Nm
this means specifying the raw device with the raw partition. i.e.
.Pa /dev/rcd0d
or
.Pa /dev/rcd0c.
.Pp
Some rewritable optical media needs to be formatted first before it can be
used by UDF. This can be done using
.Xr mmcformat 8 .
.Pp
The default UDF version is version 2.01 that can be specified if required
as "0x201".
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs_udf -S "Encyclopedia" -L "volume 2" -P "copy-nr-1" /dev/rcd0d
.Ed
.Pp
Create a file system, using the specified names on the device
.Pa /dev/rcd0d
with the default UDF version.
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dd if=/dev/zero of=bigdisk.2048.udf seek=9999999 count=1
vnconfig -c vnd0 bigdisk.2048.udf 2048/1/1/1
newfs_udf -L bigdisk /dev/rvnd0d
.Ed
.Pp
Create a 4.8 Gb sparse file and configure it using
.Xr vnconfig 8
to be a 2048 sector size disc and create a new UDF file system on 
.Pa /dev/rvnd0d .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs_udf -L "My USB stick" /dev/rsd0d
.Ed
.Pp
Create a new UDF file system on the inserted USB stick using its `native'
sectorsize of 512.
