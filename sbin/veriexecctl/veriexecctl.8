.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexecctl
.Nd load or report verified exec fingerprints
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command
.Oo
.Ar arg
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to manipulate the Verified Exec feature.
Verified Exec must have been configured into the booted kernel for this
commaned to work.
.Sh COMMANDS
.Pp
.Cm load
.Ar veriexec.conf
.Pp
Load the fingerprint entries contained in
.Ar veriexec.conf
into the in kernel tables.
This operation is only available if kern.securelevel is less than or
equal to zero.
Once loaded the kernel can then validate executed programs
or files against the loaded fingerprints and report when fingerprints
do not match.
.Pp
.Cm fingerprints
.Pp
Report the fingerprint methods that are available in the currently running
kernel.
This command will return a space separated list of supported fingerprint
methods that will be accepted by the kernel.
The default list is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
MD5
RMD160
SHA1
SHA256
SHA384
SHA512
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh VERIEXEC.CONF
.Pp
The
.Ar veriexec.conf
file contains lines of fields (separated by one or more whitespace
characters) of the form:
.Pp
.Dl path	type	fingerprint	options
.Pp
Where
.Em path
is the full path to the file and
.Em type
is the type of fingerprint used, see above for the default list.
Other fingerprints may be available depending on kernel configuration,
use the
.Cm fingerprints
command option to extract the fingerprints supported by the currently
running kernel.
The
.Em fingerprint
field is a hexadecimal representation of the fingerprint for
the file.
The field
.Em options
contains the associated options for the file.
Currently there are two valid options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width INDIRECT -compact
.Pp
.It Pa INDIRECT
If this option is set then the executable cannot be invoked directly, it
can only be used as an interpreter in shell scripts.
.It Pa FILE
Indicates that the fingerprint is associated with a file, not an
executable.
Files have their fingerprints verified during
.Xr open 2
and are automatically made read only.
This option may be used to verify shared libraries have not been
tampered with.
.El
.Pp
There must be only one executable/fingerprint pair per line.
Comments are indicated by the first character of a line being a
.Sq \&#
character.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/veriexec -compact
.It Pa /dev/veriexec
verified executable device node
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Pa /usr/share/examples/veriexecctl/gen_md5 ,
.Pa /usr/share/examples/veriexecctl/gen_sha1
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
requires the kernel to have been configured with the
.Dv VERIFIED_EXEC
option and the verifiedexec pseudo-device.
