.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexecctl
.Nd load or report veriexec fingerprints
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm load Ar signatures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to manipulate the Veriexec feature.
Veriexec must have been configured into the booted kernel for this
commaned to work.
.Sh COMMANDS
.Bl -tag -width 25n
.It Cm load Ar signatures
Load the fingerprint entries contained in
.Ar signatures
into the in kernel tables.
This operation is only available if kern.veriexec.strict is zero.
Once loaded the kernel can then validate executed programs
or files against the loaded fingerprints and report when fingerprints
do not match.
.El
.Sh SIGNATURES
The
.Pa signatures
file contains lines of fields (separated by one or more whitespace
characters) of the form:
.Pp
.Dl path	type	fingerprint	options
.Pp
Where
.Em path
is the full path to the file and
.Em type
is the type of fingerprint used, see above for the default list.
Other fingerprints may be available depending on kernel configuration.
The
.Em fingerprint
field is a hexadecimal representation of the fingerprint for
the file.
The field
.Em options
contains the associated options for the file.
Currently there are three valid options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width INDIRECT -compact
.It Dv DIRECT
Allow direct execution only.
.It Dv INDIRECT
If this option is set then the executable cannot be invoked directly, it
can only be used as an interpreter in shell scripts.
.It Dv FILE
Indicates that the fingerprint is associated with a file, not an
executable.
Files have their fingerprints verified during
.Xr open 2
and are automatically made read only.
This option may be used to verify shared libraries have not been
tampered with.
.El
.Pp
There must be only one executable/fingerprint pair per line.
Comments are indicated by the first character of a line being a
.Sq \&#
character.
Multiple options can be combined using a
.Sq \&,
character.
If no options are specified, both direct and indirect execution
are implied.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/signatures -compact
.It Pa /dev/veriexec
veriexec device node
.It Pa /etc/signatures
default signatures file
.El

.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
requires the kernel to have been configured with the
.Dv VERIFIED_EXEC
option and the veriexec pseudo-device.
.Sh BUGS
There must be no whitespace in the path field of a fingerprint entry.
