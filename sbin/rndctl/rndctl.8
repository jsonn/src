.Fl CEce
.Op Fl t Ar devtype
.Op Fl d Ar devname
.Nm ""
.Fl l
.Op Fl t Ar devtype
.Op Fl d Ar devname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program manages which devices timing information is to be collected by,
and alters the estimation of entropy of sources.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 123456
.It Fl C
Disable collection of timing information for the given
device name or device type.
.It Fl c
Enable collection of timing information for the given
device name of device type.
.It Fl E
Disable entropy estimation from the collected timing information
for the given device name or device type.  The timing information is still
collected and mixed into the internal entropy pool, but no entropy is assumed
to be present.
.It Fl e
Enable entropy estimation using the collected timing information
for the given device name or device type.
.It Fl l
List all sources, or only those specified by the
.Ar devtype
or
.Ar devname
specified.
.It Fl t
All devices of type
.Ar devtype
are altered or displayed.
.It Fl d
Only the device named
.Ar devname
is altered or displayed.
.Sh WARNINGS
Turning on entropy collection from unsafe sources can weaken system security.
Care should be taken when using this command.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program was first made available in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Nm
program was written by Michael Graff <explorer@flame.org>.
