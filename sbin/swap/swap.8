.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program adds,
.\" SWAP_OFF_WORKS: removes,
lists and prioritizes swap devices for the system.
The
.Nm swapon
program acts the same as the
.Nm
program, as if called with the
.Fl a
option, except if
.Nm swapon
itself is called with
.Fl a
in which case,
.Nm swapon
acts as 
.Nm
with the
.Fl A
option.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Sxxxsuffix
.It Fl A
This options causes
.Nm
to read the
.Pa /etc/fstab
file for devices with a ``sw'' type, and adds all these entries
as swap devices.
.It Fl a
The
.Fl a
option requires that a
.Ar device
also be in the argument list.  The
.Ar device
is added to the kernel's list of swap devices using the
.Xr swapon 2
system call.  The priority set by having ``priority=N'' in the
mount options field of the 
.Xr fstab 5 
file.
.It Fl c
The
.Fl c
option changes the priority of the listed swap device.
.\" .It Fl d
.\" The
.\" .Fl d
.\" option removes the listed
.\" .Ar device
.\" from the kernel's list of swap devices.
.It Fl l
The
.Fl l
option lists the current swap devices and files, and their usage statistics.
.It Fl s
The
.Fl s
option displays a single line summary of current swap statistics.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option sets the priority of swap devices to the
.Ar priority
argument.  This works with the
.\" .Fl d ,
.Fl a
and
.Fl l
options.
.It Fl k
The
.Fl k
option uses 1024 byte blocks instead of the default 512 byte.
