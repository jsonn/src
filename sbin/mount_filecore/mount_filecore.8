.Dt MOUNT_FILECORE 8
.Os NetBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_filecore
.Nd mount a FILECORE file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ""
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl R
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Pa special node
.Sh ORIGIN
The
.Nx
FILECORE filesystem is a read only implementation of the filecore file system
found in Acorn Computers RISC OS operating system. This operating system
is the ROM based operating system found on their ARM 6, ARM7 and
StrongARM 110 based RiscPC machines that are supported by the arm32 port.
Under RISC OS, filecore will have multiple instantiations for file
systems on different block devices such as floppies, IDE discs, SCSI discs
etc. and these frquently are considered to be different filesystems
e.g. ADFS, IDEFS, SCSIFS etc.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the FILECORE filesystem residing on
the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount a
FILECORE file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl o Ar options
Use the specified mount
.Ar options ,
as described in
.Xr mount 8 .
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl a
Give all files world access.
.It Fl n
Give all files owner access.
.It Fl R
Give all files owner read access.
.It Fl f
Append the filetype to each filename. This option currently has no effect.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Sq filecore
filesystem currently supports the Acorn filecore file system found on
Acorn Computers RiscPC desktop machines with versions of RISC OS upto 3.70.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 1.4.
