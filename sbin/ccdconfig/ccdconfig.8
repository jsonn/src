.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Ccdconfig
is used to dynamically configure and unconfigure concatenated disk
devices, or ccds.  For more information about the ccd, see
.Xr ccd 4 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c
Configure a ccd.  This is the default behavior of
.Nm ccdconfig .
.It Fl C
Configure all ccd devices listed in the ccd configuration file.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
When configuring or unconfiguring all devices, read the file
.Pa config_file
instead of the default
.Pa /etc/ccd.conf .
.It Fl g
Dump the current ccd configuration in a format suitable for use as the
ccd configuration file.  If no arguments are specified, every configured
ccd is dumped.  Otherwise, the configuration of each listed ccd is dumped.
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from
.Pa core
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/mem .
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from
.Pa system
instead of the default
.Pa /netbsd .
.It Fl u
Unconfigure a ccd.
.It Fl U
Unconfigure all ccd devices listed the ccd configuration file.
.It Fl v
Causes
.Nm ccdconfig
to be verbose.
.El
.Pp
A ccd is described on the command line and in the ccd configuration
file by the name of the ccd, the interleave factor, the ccd configuration
flags, and a list of one or more devices.  The flags may be represented
as a decimal number, a hexadecimal number, a comma-separated list
of strings, or the word
.Dq none .
The flags are as follows:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
CCDF_SWAP		0x01		Interleave should be dmmax
CCDF_UNIFORM	0x02		Use uniform interleave
.Ed
.Pp
The format in the
configuration file appears exactly as if it were entered on the command line.
Note that on the command line and in the configuration file, the
.Pa flags
argument is optional.
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
#
# /etc/ccd.conf
# Configuration file for concatenated disk devices

# ccd           ileave  flags   component devices
ccd0            16      none    /dev/sd2e /dev/sd3e

.Sh EXAMPLE
The following command, executed from the command line, would configure ccd0
with 4 components (/dev/sd2e, /dev/sd3e, /dev/sd4e, /dev/sd5e), and an
interleave factor of 32 blocks.
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
# ccdconfig ccd0 32 0 /dev/sd2e /dev/sd3e /dev/sd4e /dev/sd5e
