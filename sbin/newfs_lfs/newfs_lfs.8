.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_lfs
.Nd construct a new LFS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar newfs_lfs-options
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
builds a log-structured file system on the specified special
device basing its defaults on the information in the disk label.
Before running 
.Nm
the disk must be labeled using 
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
the proper fstype is 4.4LFS.  Reasonable values for the
.Li fsize, 
.Li bsize,
and
.Li cpg
(really 
.Li sgs,
segment shift) fields are 1024, 8192, and 7 respectively.
.Pp
The following options define the general layout policies.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl B Ar logical-segment-size
The logical segment size of the file system in bytes.  If not specified,
the segment size is computed by left-shifting the partition label's block
size by the amount indicated in the partition table's segshift.  If the
disklabel indicates a zero block size or segment shift, a compile-time default
segment size of 1M is used.
.It Fl b Ar block-size
The block size of the file system in bytes.  If not specified, the block
size is taken from the partition label, or if the partition label
indicates 0, a compile-time default of 8K is used.
.It Fl F
Force creation of an LFS even on a partition labeled as another type.
.Nm
will use compile-time default values for block and fragment size, and segment
shift, unless these are overridden by command-line flags.
.It Fl f Ar fragment-size
The fragment size of the file system in bytes.  If not specified,
the fragment size is taken from the partition label, or if the partition
label indicates 0, a compile-time default of 1K is used.
.It Fl L
Create a log-structured file system (LFS).  This is the default, and this
option is provided for compatibility only.
.It Fl m Ar free space \&%
The percentage of space reserved from normal users; the minimum
free space threshold.  The default value used is 10%.
.It Fl M Ar nsegs
Reserve this many segments for use exclusively by the cleaner, instead
of letting
.Nm
do the computation.  Do not use this option.
.It Fl N
Do not actually create the filesystem.
.It Fl s Ar size
The size of the file system in sectors.
