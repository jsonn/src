.Sh NAME
.Nm wsconsctl
.Nd get or set wscons state
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl kdm
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Fl a
.Nm
.Op Fl kdm
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Ar name ...
.Nm
.Op Fl kdm
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n

.Ar name Ns Li = Ns Ar value ...
.Nm
.Op Fl kdm
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl n
.Fl w
.Ar name Ns Li += Ns Ar value ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command displays or sets various wscons system driver variables.
If a list of variables is present on the command line, then
.Nm
prints the current value of those variables for the specified device.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
is used to specify all variables for the device.
.It Fl w
.Nm
attempts to set or modify the specified variables to the given values.
The value can be specified as either an absolute value, by using the
.Ql =
symbol
or as a relative value, by using the
.Ql +=
symbol.
See the
.Ar EXAMPLES
section for more details.
.It Fl f Ar file
is used to specify an alternative control device.
.It Fl n
suppresses the printing of the variable name in the output -
only the value will appear.
.It Fl k
selects the keyboard portion of the device (this is the default).
.It Fl d
selects the display portion of the device.
.It Fl m
selects the mouse portion of the device.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility can be used to view and modify aspects of the keyboard,
display and mouse, using the standard, machine-independent
workstation console device driver
.Xr wscons 4 .
.Pp
The keyboard type can be modified, the keyboard bell's pitch,
period and duration
can be modified,
the
.Ar typematic
value can be changed, and the keyboard encoding can be modified
to switch keys, should the user find a keyboard's default layout
difficult to use.
The keyboard types and other relevant definitions
can all be found in the
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsconsio.h
file.
.Pp
The mouse types are defined in the
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsconsio.h
file.
.Pp
The display types, height, width,
depth (bits per pixel), color map size, and color map
are defined in the
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsconsio.h
file.
There are also definitions relating to video
control and cursor control, which are not applicable to
all display types, and to text emulation and graphics
(mapped) modes.
.Pp
There are currently keyboard encodings for the following
countries: British, Danish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian,
Spanish, Swedish, US, US-Dvorak, and user-defined.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/wsmouse
.It Pa /dev/wskbd
keyboard control device
.It Pa /dev/wsmouse
mouse control device
.It Pa /dev/ttyE0
display control device
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following are just a few examples of
.Nm
and its functionality.
.Pp
.Dl wsconsctl -w encoding=uk
.Pp
Sets a UK keyboard encoding.
.Pp
.Dl wsconsctl -w map+="keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L"
.Pp
Modifies the current keyboard encoding so that when the
.Ar Caps Lock
key is pressed, the same encoding sequence as
.Ar Left Control
is sent.
For a full list of keysyms and keycodes, please refer
to the
.Pa /usr/include/dev/wscons/wsksymdef.h
file.
.Pp
.Dl wsconsctl -w encoding=us.swapctrlcaps
.Pp
Sets a US keyboard encoding, with the
.Ar Caps Lock
and
.Ar Left Control
keys swapped.
The
.Ar .swapctrlcaps
encoding does not work for all national keyboard encodings.
For most purposes, the ability to set the value returned
by the
.Ar Caps Lock
key is enough - see the previous example for details.
.Pp
.Dl wsconsctl -w bell.pitch=1200
.Pp
Sets the bell pitch to be 1200, whilst
.Pp
.Dl wsconsctl -w bell.pitch+=200
.Pp
Adds 200 to the current pitch of the bell.
