.Sh NAME
.Nm atactl
.Nd a program to manipulate ATA (IDE) devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar device
.Ar command
.Oo
.Ar arg Oo ...
.Oc
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows a user or system administrator to issue commands to and otherwise
control devices which reside on standard IDE and ATA controllers.  It is
used by specifying
a device to manipulate, the command to perform, and any arguments
the command may require.
.Sh DEVICE COMMANDS
The following commands may be used on IDE and ATA devices.  Note
that not all devices support all commands.
.Pp
.Cm identify
.Pp
Identify the specified device, displaying the device's vendor, product,
revision strings, and the device's capabilities.
.Pp
.Cm idle
.Pp
Place the specified device into Idle mode.  This mode may consume less
power than Active mode.
.Pp
.Cm standby
.Pp
Place the specified device into Standby mode.  This mode will consume
less power than Idle mode.
.Pp
.Cm sleep
.Pp
Place he specified device into Sleep mode.  This mode will consume
less power than Standby mode, but requires a device reset to resume
operation.  Typically the
.Xr wd 4
driver performs this reset automatically, but this should still be
used with caution.
.Pp
.Cm setidle
.Ar standby-timer
.Pp
Places the specified device into Idle mode, and sets the Standby timer
to
.Ar standby-timer
seconds.  A value of 0 will disable the Standby timer.
.Pp
.Cm setstandby
.Ar standby-timer

Places the specified device into Standby mode, and sets the Standby timer
to
.Ar standby-timer
seconds.  A value of 0 will disable the Standby timer.

management mode.
.Sh BUGS
The output from the
.Cm identify
command is rather ugly.
