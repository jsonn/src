.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_ntfs
.Nd mount an NTFS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ntfs
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the NTFS filesystem residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
NTFS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Force behaviour to return MS-DOS 8.3 names also on 
.Fn readdir .
.It Fl i
Make name lookup case insensitive for all names except POSIX names.
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
.El
.Sh FEATURES
.Ss NTFS file attributes
NTFS file attributes can be accessed in following way:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
foo[[:ATTRTYPE]:ATTRNAME]
.Ed
.Pp
.Sq ATTRTYPE
is one of identifier listed in $AttrDef file of
volume. Default is $DATA.
.Sq ATTRNAME
is an attribute name. Default is none.
.Pp
.Sy Examples:
.Pp
To get volume name (in Unicode):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /mnt/\\$Volume:\\$VOLUME_NAME
.Ed
.Pp
To read directory raw data:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /mnt/foodir:\\$INDEX_ROOT:\\$I30
.Ed
.Pp
.Ss Limited support for writing
There is limited writing ability. Limitations: file must be nonresident,
must not contain any holes (uninitialized areas) and can't be compressed.
.Pp
.Sy Warning:
while read-only mode appears to be very stable and there are
no known problems, the read-write mode
has not been very well tested yet and it may well be possible
that an attempt to write into file residing on NTFS could
damage the filesystem. Don't experiment with read-write mode unless
you are ready to recover the trashed contents any time.
