.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_ntfs

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ntfs
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Pa special
.Pa node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the NTFS filesystem residing on the device
.Pa special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Pa node .
This command is normally executed by
.Xr mount 8
at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
NTFS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Force behaviour to return MS-DOS 8.3 names also on 
.Fn readdir .
.It Fl i
Make name lookup case insensitive for all names except POSIX names.
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
.El
.Sh FEATURES
NTFS file attributes are accessed in following way:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
foo[[:ATTRTYPE]:ATTRNAME]
.Ed
.Pp
.Sq ATTRTYPE
is one of identifier listed in $AttrDef file of
volume. Default is $DATA.
.Sq ATTRNAME
is an attribute name. Default is none.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To mount an ntfs volume located in 
.Pa /dev/wd1s1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mount_ntfs /dev/wd1s1 /mnt
.Ed
.Pp
To get volume name (in Unicode):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /mnt/\\$Volume:\\$VOLUME_NAME
.Ed
.Pp
To read directory raw data:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /mnt/foodir:\\$INDEX_ROOT:\\$I30
.Ed
.Pp
.Sh WRITING
There is limited writing ability. Limitations: file must be nonresident
and must not contain any holes (uninitialized areas), compressed
files are not supported either.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr unmount 2 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh BUGS
Note that NTFS support is still very experimental on NetBSD and
should be used with extreme caution. Do not mount NTFS volumes read-write
unless you are ready to recreate trashed contents.
