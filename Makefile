#	$NetBSD: Makefile,v 1.118.2.2 2000/08/24 02:19:59 fredb Exp $

# This is the top-level makefile for building NetBSD. For an outline of
# how to build a snapshot or release, as well as other release engineering
# information, see http://www.netbsd.org/developers/releng/index.html
#
# Not everything you can set or do is documented in this makefile. In
# particular, you should review the files in /usr/share/mk (especially
# bsd.README) for general information on building programs and writing
# Makefiles within this structure, and see the comments in src/etc/Makefile
# for further information on installation and release set options.
#
# Variables listed below can be set on the make command line (highest
# priority), in /etc/mk.conf (middle priority), or in the environment
# (lowest priority).
#
# Variables:
#   DESTDIR is the target directory for installation of the compiled
#	software. It defaults to /. Note that programs are built against
#	libraries installed in DESTDIR.
#   MKMAN, if set to `no', will prevent building of manual pages.
#   MKOBJDIRS, if not set to `no', will build object directories at 
#	an appropriate point in a build.
#   MKSHARE, if set to `no', will prevent building and installing
#	anything in /usr/share.
#   NBUILDJOBS is the number of jobs to start in parallel during a
#	'make build'. It defaults to 1.
#   UPDATE will avoid a `make cleandir' at the start of `make build',
#	as well as having the effects listed in /usr/share/mk/bsd.README.
#
# Targets:
#   build: builds a full release of netbsd in DESTDIR. If BUILD_DONE is
#	set, this is an empty target.
#   release: does a `make build,' and then tars up the DESTDIR files
#	into RELEASEDIR, in release(7) format. (See etc/Makefile for
#	more information on this.)
#   snapshot: a synonym for release.
