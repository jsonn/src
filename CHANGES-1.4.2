  directories.  Addresses PR#8220.

  potentially bad interatctions with the pool code.

usr.sbin/mopd/common/dl.c			1.4

  In a program request packet during the second and third stage of an
  Ultrix/mips MOP boot, the "software" packet is 256 bytes - bump the
  size of the program array (maximum for the VAX must only be 16 bytes).

sys/dev/raidframe/rf_netbsdkintf.c		1.24

  Don't allow reconstructs, copybacks, or forced failures of components if
  using a RAID 0, since RAID 0 can't handle those sorts of things.

  Don't panic the system just because there is a problem verifying
  the parity.

sys/dev/raidframe/rf_reconstruct.c		1.6

  Serve UDP requests by default if neither UDP nor TCP is specified,
  as already documented in the man page.  Fixes PR#7358.

libexec/ftpd/ftpd.c				1.70

  Avoid segmentation fault if there is an empty line in /etc/ftpusers,
  fixing PR#8504.

  Add a driver for Alteon Gigabit Ethernet cards.

sys/nfs/nfs_boot.c				1.51-1.52

  Mount diskless root with "noconn" option to allow easier use of
  multi-homed servers.  Also, wait a while between bringing up
  interface and using it, to allow drivers to establish link settings.

libexec/ftpd/ftpcmd.y				1.39

  Don't use an undefined C expression, fixing PR#8534.

gnu/dist/bfd/targets.c				1.10

  Fix calculation of size of bfd_target_vector, which was incorrect and
  would cause some bfd-using programs (e.g. ar) to crash.  Fixes PR#8200
  and PR#8573.

usr.bin/rwho/rwho.c				1.12

  Use full hostnames when sorting rwho database entries.  Fixes PR#8401.

usr.bin/id/id.c					1.15

  Fix inconsistent format between `id' and `id userid'.  Fixes PR#8706.

bin/sh/jobs.c					1.32

  Allow the tty interrupt character (e.g. ^C) to interrupt loops run
  in an interactive shell again.

sys/arch/i386/conf/GENERIC			1.262, 1.264 via patch
distrib/notes/i386/hardware			1.56

  Remove "nca* at isa?" from i386 GENERIC kernel.  Its probe function
  gives false positives and steps on other hardware.  Fixes PR#8361.

usr.sbin/quot/quot.c				1.15-1.16

  Fix integer overflows with file systems >=2GB.

sys/nfs/nfs_nqlease.c				1.30

  Fix an odd corner case if you use nfsv3 and nqnfs at the same time:
  v3 changes the error-case behavior of the nfsm_reply macro, but the
  caller keeps going and in this case you end up calling vput(NULL).

sys/net/route.c					1.28

  Avoid duplicate free() calls if a route's gateway points to itself,
  by marking a route down (~RTF_UP) _after_ calling RTFREE on its
  gateway.  Partial fix for PR#4561 and PR#4827 (the looped route can
  still occur, but it won't cause a panic).

sys/net/pfil.c					1.9

  Fix panic()s in pfil_list_remove() when running "ipf -D" a second
  time with a DIAGNOSTIC kernel.

  Fix potential overflow of v_usecount and v_writecount (and panics
  resulting from this) by widening them to `long'.  Mostly affects
  systems where maxvnodes>=32768.

lib/libntp/systime.c				1.4-1.6

  Fix an LP64 bug that would cause NTP to report "previous time
  adjustment did not complete" on NetBSD/alpha.  Fixes PR#7602.

usr.sbin/xntp/xntpd/ntp_proto.c			1.6

  Improve calculation of 'tick' used in the precision estimate.

usr.sbin/xntp/xntpd/ntp_peer.c			1.5

  Don't start all peers simultaneously if using DNS names in ntp.conf.

sys/kern/kern_clock.c				1.50

  If using kernel NTP PLL, initialize "fixtick" to a reasonable
  approximation of reality if machine-dependent code doesn't.  This
  allows a NetBSD/alpha kernel (where hz=1024) with "options NTP" to
  synch up quite nicely (as opposed to having an frequency error of
  ~560ppm, which is outside the capture range of the PLL).

sys/arch/alpha/alpha/clock.c			1.26

  Patch time_precision so we report a realistic NTP "precision"
  value to userland.

libexec/lfs_cleanerd/library.c			1.13-1.14

  Remove incorrect partial-segment timestamp optimization from
  lfs_segmapv which would cause continuous cleaning and eventual
  panics with "no clean segments."  Don't complain if fstat() fails
  on the Ifile when the file system has been unmounted (avoids
  expected errors every time an LFS is unmounted).

usr.sbin/ac/ac.c				1.9
usr.bin/systat/ps.c				1.6
usr.bin/w/w.c					1.32

  Make various utilities skip "dty" as well as "tty" on terminals,
  so that the actually used tty is visiable instead of just 'dt'.

sys/kern/kern_synch.c				1.66

  Correct use of `wrong' clock for %cpu calculation.  (This is not
  a functional change at present because all clock frequencies are
  the same.)

sys/netinet/ip_input.c				1.93
sys/netinet/ip_flow.c				1.14

  Multicast storm prevention: don't attempt to forward link-level

  In spec_close(), call the device's close routine with the vnode
  unlocked if the call might block. Force a non-blocking close if
  VXLOCK is set.  This eliminates a potential deadlock situation, and
  should eliminate the dirty buffers on reboot issue.

etc/rc.conf					1.59

  Add "-f /var/db/ntp.drift" to default xntpd parameters to make it
  more likely the clock frequency error learned by NTP will be
  retained across reboots.

sys/dev/wscons/wsdisplay.c			1.31
sys/dev/wscons/wsdisplay_compat_usl.c		1.10

  -> /dev/ttyEcfg).

sys/arch/macppc/include/disklabel.h		1.4
sys/arch/macppc/macppc/disksubr.c		1.5

  Add support for reading MacOS-partitioned disks. Stolen from the mac68k
  port, but modified in that macppc searches for netbsd-partitioned
  disks before MacOS partitioned disks, since installboot generates a
  fake MacOS partition table which isn't the one we want to use.

sys/arch/macppc/include/vmparam.h		1.9
sys/arch/macppc/include/param.h			1.5-1.6

  Fix "panic: startup: cannot allocate VM for buffers" right after

  Move kernel segment base to 0xf00000, some Power Macintosh 9500s
  won't boot witht he old value.

  Fix IPv6 parsing for the benefit of BIND.

gnu/usr.bin/ld/ld/lib.c				1.20

  Don't abuse alloca() for allocating string sections which can
  easily have a size of several megabytes, exceeding the hard stack
  limit on some ports.  Fixes PR#8547.

sys/dev/ic/wdc.c				1.76

  The WDCF_IRQ_WAIT flag was erroneously cleared when an earlier
  interrupt not for this IDE channel controller was received.
  Fixes the "missing untimeout" problems and PR#8639.

distrib/notes/pmax/install			1.22

  The netboot kernel is called "install.ecoff", not "install".

sys/arch/i386/conf/INSTALL			patch

  Add "rl" and "vr" PCI Ethernet device drivers.  Remove EXEC_ELF32
  and "en at pci" to make install kernel still fit in 1.44MB.  ATM-
  only machines should be rare, and will need to borrow an ethernet
  card for installation or use a custom install floppy.

sys/arch/i386/conf/GENERIC			patch

  Add "rl" PCI Ethernet device driver.

sys/dev/cons.c					1.33

  Catch a console configuration error.  Instead of jumping through
  cdevsw indexed on major(NODEV), call panic, fixing PR#8690.

  Do not mislead users by inserting "lookup files bind" in
  /etc/resolv.conf; after we converted to nsswitch this is
  handled elsewhere.

distrib/notes/pmax/install			1.22

  Note that the netboot kernel is called "install.ecoff", not "install".

gnu/usr.bin/send-pr/send-pr.man			1.5

  Document the files and environment variables used by send-pr to fill in
  defaults for problem reports, in the FILES and ENVIRONMENT sections
  of the manual page, respectively.  Fixes PR#1889.

  don't fit in the user buffer all at once.  Fixes PR#4492.

sys/arch/sparc/sparc/locore.s			1.126

  Fix several panics in copy{in,out,}str().

  is connected) which is often misunderstood to be an error message.

sys/ufs/lfs/lfs_vnops.c				1.29-1.30

  When using the procfs for extracting process information, extract process
  start time, arguments, and session leadership status.  Also, fall back to

  have a choice in the matter).

sys/arch/i386/i386/apmcall.s			1.6

  Make a standard kernel usable on IBM laptops (and possibly others).
  Some machines require interrupts enabled at suspend-time in order
  to avoid a hang at resume.  Fixes PR#6279.

sys/nfs/nfs_socket.c				1.52-1.53
