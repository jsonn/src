File						Version(s)

  Add the ability to read V7 tar archives which use USTAR-style

sbin/newfs_msdos/newfs_msdos.c			1.4

  After determining the size of a file being used as an msdosfs image, seek
  back to its start so subsequent writes go to the right places.  (cgd)

lib/libkvm/kvm_file.c				1.14

  Fix kvm_getfiles() so that it works properly on kernel core dumps.  (cgd)

usr.bin/netstat/unix.c				1.18

  Report error returns from kvm_getfiles() more correctly.  (cgd)

sys/lib/libsa/ufs.c				1.26

  Fix a problem that could cause files' seek pointers to be incorrect
  after being opened.  (cgd)

usr.sbin/mbrlabel/mbrlabel.c			1.4-1.5

  Correct usage message and make the MBR examination code function
  properly on architectures which enforce strict alignment.  (cgd)

usr.bin/tail/forward.c				1.16
usr.bin/tail/read.c				1.7

sys/msdosfs/msdosfs_vnops.c			1.83

  Fix LP64 problems which made the MS-DOS file system unusable on
  NetBSD/alpha as reported in PR#8037 and several other problems
  encountered while researching it (NFS exporting and printf
  formats).  (cgd)

usr.bin/find/extern.h				1.12

  Implement -regex and -iregex primaries which behave similarly (but
  not identically) to the GNU find primaries of the same names.  (The
  differences are caused by differences in the Basic Regular
  Expression implementations.)  (cgd)
