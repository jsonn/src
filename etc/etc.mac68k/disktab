# Disk geometry and partition layout tables. 
# Key:
#	ty	type of disk
#	ns	#sectors/track
#	nt	#tracks/cylinder
#	nc	#cylinders/disk
#	rm	rpm, 3600 default
#	se	sector size, 512 default
#	sf	supports bad144-style bad sector forwarding
#	so	partition offsets in sectors
#	p[a-h]	partition sizes in sectors
#	b[a-h]	partition block sizes in bytes
#	f[a-h]	partition fragment sizes in bytes
#
# All partition sizes contain space
# for bad sector tables unless the
# device drivers fail to support this.
#
# Entries may also be used for other compatible drives
# with the same geometry.

# Again, these mapping support three basic layouts:
# Again, these mapping support three basic layouts:
#
#	A/B/G:   This is the "traditional" setup for a bootable disk.
#	         A is the root partition, B the swap, and G is for /usr
#		 and users.
#	A/D/E/F (large drives):
#	A/D/H (small drives):
#		 This is a setup for bootable systems requiring more swap
#	         (e.g. those who need CL).  It has A as the root, D as a
#	         larger swap, E and F (or H) as smaller user partitions.
#		 E could  be used for /usr and F for users (or H for both).
#		 Or, E could be used for /var and F for /usr and users.
#	C:       This gives a single, non-bootable, large user filesystem.
#	         Good for second drives on a machine as either /usr/src
#		 or a large /usr or user partition.
