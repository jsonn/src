NetBSD ?.? (UNKNOWN)

Welcome to NetBSD!

This system is running a development snapshot of one of the stable branches of
the NetBSD operating system.  This branch will eventually lead to a new formal
release, but it cannot be considered release quality at the moment.  Meanwhile,
it is possible for it to contain bugs or any other kind of problem.  Please
bear this in mind and use the system with care.

You are encouraged to test this version as thoroughly as possible.  Should you
encounter any problem, please report it back to the development team using the
send-pr(1) utility (requires a working MTA).  If yours is not properly set up,
use the web interface at: http://www.NetBSD.org/Misc/send-pr.html

Thank you for testing this NetBSD release and helping us improve it.
