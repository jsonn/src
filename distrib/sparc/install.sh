This program is designed to help you put NetBSD on your disk,
in a simple and rational way.  You'll be asked several questions,
and it would probably be useful to have your disk's hardware
manual, the installation notes, and a calculator handy.

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this
program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised
to make sure your data is backed up before beginning the
installation process.

Default answers are displyed in brackets after the questions.
You can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a
prompt, you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.

You will now be given the opportunity to escape to the command shell to
do any additional network configuration you may need.  This may include
adding additional routes, if needed.  In addition, you might take this
opportunity to redo the default route in the event that it failed above.
If you do change the default route, and wish for that change to carry over
to the installed system, execute the following command at the shell
prompt:

	echo <ip_address_of_gateway> > /tmp/mygate

where <ip_address_of_gateway> is the IP address of the default router.

also wish to take this opportunity to place NFS mounts in the fstab.
This would be especially useful if you plan to keep '/usr' on an NFS
server.
