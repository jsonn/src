The upgrade program would now like to enable the network.  It will use the
configuration already stored on the root filesystem.  This is required
if you wish to use the network installation capabilities of this program.

You will now be given the opportunity to escape to the command shell to
do any additional network configuration you may need.  This may include
adding additional routes, if needed.  In addition, you might take this
opportunity to redo the default route in the event that it failed above.
