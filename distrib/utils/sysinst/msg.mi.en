message hello
{Welcome to sysinst, the NetBSD-@@VERSION@@ system installation tool.
This menu-driven tool is designed to help you install NetBSD to a hard
disk, or upgrade an existing NetBSD system, with a minimum of work.
In the following menus, you may change the current selection by
either typing the reference letter (a, b, c, ...).  Arrow keys may also work.
You activate the current selection from the menu by typing the enter key.

If you booted from a floppy, you may now remove the disk.

Thank you for using NetBSD!
}

message installusure
{You have chosen to install NetBSD on your hard disk.  This will change
information on your hard disk.  You should have made a full backup
before this procedure!  This procedure will do the following things: 
	a) Partition your disk 
	b) Create new BSD file systems 
	c) Load and install distribution sets

(After you enter the partition information but before your disk is
changed, you will have the opportunity to quit this procedure.)

Shall we continue?
}

message upgradeusure
{Ok, lets upgrade NetBSD on your hard disk.  As always, this will
change information on your hard disk.  You should have made a full backup
before this procedure!  Do you really want to upgrade NetBSD?
(This is your last warning before this procedure starts modifying your
disks.)
}

message reinstallusure
{Ok, lets unpack the NetBSD distribution sets to a bootable hard disk.
This procedure just fetches and unpacks sets onto an pre-partitioned
bootable disk. It does not label disks, upgrade bootblocks, or save
any existing configuration info.  (Quit and choose `install' or
`upgrade' if you want those options.)  You should have already done an
`install' or `upgrade' before starting this procedure!

Do you really want to reinstall NetBSD distribution sets?
(This is your last warning before this procedure starts modifying your
disks.)

Your selected target disk %s also holds the current root device.  I
need to know whether I'm currently running out of the target root

I can't tell unless you mount the root.

I'm aborting back to the main menu so you can fork a subshell.

message layout
{NetBSD uses a BSD disklabel to carve up the NetBSD portion of the disk
into multiple BSD partitions.  You must now set up your BSD disklabel.
You have several choices.  They are summarized below. 
-- Standard: the BSD disklabel partitions are computed by this program. 
-- Standard with X: twice the swap space, space for X binaries. 
-- Custom: you specify the sizes of all the BSD disklabel partitions.

The NetBSD part of your disk is %.2f Megabytes. 
Standard requires at least %.2f Megabytes. 
Standard with X requires at least %.2f Megabytes.
}

message sizechoice
{You have elected to specify partition sizes (either for the BSD
disklabel, or on some ports, for MBR slices). You must first choose a
size unit to use.  Choosing megabytes will give partition sizes close
to your choice, but aligned to cylinder boundaries. Choosing sectors
will allow you to more accurately specify the sizes.  On modern ZBR disks,
actual cylinder size varies across the disk and there is little real
gain from cylinder alignment. On older disks, it is most efficient to
choose partition sizes that are exact multiples of your actual
cylinder size.

The program "%s" failed unexpectedly with return code %s.

Install on an already-running system.  Or it might be due to a
mispackaged miniroot.  Whatever the cause, sysinst did not expect any
errors here and the installation has almost certainly failed.
