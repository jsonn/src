message fullpart
{We are now going to install NetBSD on the disk %s.  You may
choose to install NetBSD on the entire disk or part of the disk.
Which would you like to do?
}

message wdtype
{What kind of disk is %s?}

message sectforward
{Does your disk to AUTOMATIC sector forwarding?}

message dlgeom
{It appears that your disk, %s, has already been labeled with a BSD 
disklabel and the disklabel reports geometry that is different from
the the real geometry.  The two geometries are:

disklabel: %d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors
real geom: %d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors
}

message nobiosgeom
{It appears that your disk, %s, did not have a valid Master Boot
Record (MBR). This program gets the BIOS geometry of your disk by
reading the MBR, so the BIOS geometry of your disk could not
be determined in this case.  Your options are:
    -- Abort the install. You can determine the actual BIOS
       geometry in your BIOS setup and then come back and
       enter the values. Or you can use another setup program to
       initialize the MBR first.
    -- Enter the BIOS geometry values yourself. Sysinst will initialize
       the MBR for you.

WARNING: Entering a new geometry will cause this program to initialize
your master boot record (MBR) and destroy any boot program you may
have installed.

}

message diagcyl
{Some old BIOSs or old diagnostic programs may use the last cylinder of
the disk for test purposes. This should no longer be the case with
modern systems. If you have an old system and are uncertain if it
may do this, you can exclude the last cylinder of your harddisk
from use.

If you exclude the last cylinder, both the real and BIOS geometry will
be adjusted, you do not need to reenter them.

Do you wish to exclude the last cylinder?

}

message part_head
{No   Start(%s)   Size(%s)   End(%s)  Kind\n}

message setbiosgeom
{You will be prompted for the geometry.  Please enter the values you
want.  The number of cylinders should be <= 1024 and the number of sectors
should be <= 63. If you have the BIOS set up to use > 1024 cylinders just
truncate that number to 1024 here; NetBSD will know about the rest of the
cylinders.

}

message confirmbiosgeom
{Please verify if the BIOS disk geometry below is correct. The value for
the number of cylinders may have been truncated to 1024. This is ok as
long as the other numbers are correct; only 1024 cylinders can be
specified in the MBR, the rest will be found in a different way by NetBSD.

If you re-enter the values, make sure that the values are correct and
match those used by other systems on this disk. Values that do not match
may result in data corruption.

}

message badgeom
{The current values for your disk geometry are:

}

message realgeom
{real geom: %d cyl, %d heads, %d sec\n}

message biosgeom
{BIOS geom: %d cyl, %d heads, %d sec\n}

message reentergeom
{The values just entered for the geometry are not usable.  Please,
reenter the geometry.
}

message ovrwrite
{Your disk currently has a non-NetBSD partition.  Do you really want to
overwrite that partition with NetBSD?
}

message parttable
{The partition table on your disk currently looks like the following:
}

message editpart
{Partition %d looks like:\n\n}

message editparttable
{Edit your DOS partition table.  The highlighted partition is the currently
active partition.   The partition table currently looks like:

}

message reeditpart
{There are overlaping MBR partitions or do not have exactly one NetBSD 
partition. You should re-edit the MBR partition table.

Do you want to re-edit it?
}

message nobsdpart
{There is no NetBSD partition in the MBR partition table.}

message multbsdpart
{There are multiple NetBSD partitions in the MBR partition table.
Partition %d will be the one used.}

message dofdisk
{Setting up the DOS partition table ...
}

message dobad144
{Installing the bad block table ...
}

message dobootblks
{Installing boot blocks on %s....
}

message askfsroot
{I will be asking for partition information.

First the root partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
Root partition size? }

message askfsswap
{
Next the swap partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
Swap partition size? }

message otherparts
{You still have some space remaining unallocated on your disk.  Please
give sizes and mount points for the following partitions.

}

message askfspart
{The next partition is /dev/%s%c.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
Partition size? }

message cyl1024
{ The disklabel (set of partitions) you specified has a root partition that
ends beyond the 1024 BIOS cylinder boundary. To be sure that the system
can be booted at all times, the entire root partition must lie below that
limit. You can either: }
