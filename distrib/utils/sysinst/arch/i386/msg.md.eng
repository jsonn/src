choose to install NetBSD on the entire disk or part of the disk.
Which would you like to do?

message wdtype
{What kind of disk is %s?}

message sectforward
{Does your disk to AUTOMATIC sector forwarding?}

message dlgeom
{It appears that your disk, %s, has already been labeled with a BSD 
disklabel and the disklabel reports geometry that is different from
the the real geometry.  The two geometries are:

disklabel: %d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors
real geom: %d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors
}

message biosgeom
{It appears that your disk, %s, did not have a valid Master Boot
Record (MBR).  That is, NetBSD is using a geometry which is 
incompatible with the BIOS.  This "sysinst" program gets the BIOS 
fake geometry of your disk by reading the MBR.  Your options are:
    -- Abort the install and initialize the MBR from some other OS
    -- Enter the BIOS fake geometry and sysinst will initialize the MBR

WARNING: Entering new geometry will cause this program to initialize
your master boot record (MBR) and destroy any boot program you may
have installed.
