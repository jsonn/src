message md_hello
{If you booted from a floppy, you may now remove the disk.

}

message fullpart
{We are now going to install NetBSD on the disk %s.  You may
choose to install NetBSD on the entire disk, or on part of the disk.

Partial-disk installation creates a partition, or `slice', for NetBSD
in your disk's MBR partition table. Whole-disk installation is
`dangerously dedicated': it takes over the entire MBR. This WILL
overwrite all existing data and OSes on the disk. It also prohibits later
installation of multiple OSes on that disk (unless you overwrite NetBSD and
reinstall using only part of the disk).

Which would you like to do?
}

message wdtype
{What kind of disk is %s?}

message sectforward
{Does your disk do AUTOMATIC sector forwarding?}

message dlgeom
{It appears that your disk, %s, has already been labeled with a BSD
disklabel and the disklabel reports geometry that is different from
the real geometry.  The two geometries are:

{You will be prompted for the geometry.  Please enter the values you
want.  The number of cylinders should be <= 1024 and the number of sectors
should be <= 63. If you have the BIOS set up to use > 1024 cylinders just
truncate that number to 1024 here; NetBSD will know about the rest of the
cylinders.

message confirmbiosgeom
{Please verify if the BIOS disk geometry below is correct. The value for
the number of cylinders may have been truncated to 1024. This is ok as
long as the other numbers are correct; only 1024 cylinders can be
specified in the MBR, the rest will be found in a different way by NetBSD.

If you reenter the values, make sure that the values are correct and
match those used by other systems on this disk. Values that do not match
may result in data corruption.

that the BIOS can address. The initial bootcode in the Master Boot
Record needs to be able to use the extended BIOS interface to boot
off this partition. Do you want to install the NetBSD bootcode into
the Master Boot Record so that this is ensured? Note that this will
overwrite the existing code in the MBR, like some bootselectors.}

message installnormalmbr
{You have chosen not to install a bootselector. If this was because you
already have a bootselector installed, no further action is needed.
However, if no bootselector is installed, the normal bootcode must be

NetBSD bootcode?}
