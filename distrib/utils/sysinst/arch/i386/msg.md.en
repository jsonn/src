message fullpart
{We are now going to install NetBSD on the disk %s.  You may
choose to install NetBSD on the entire disk, or on part of the disk.

Partial-disk installation creates a partition, or `slice', for NetBSD
in your disk's MBR partition table. Whole-disk installation is
`dangerously dedicated': it takes over the entire MBR. This WILL
overwrite all existing data and OSes on the disk. It also prohibits later
installation of multiple OSes on that disk (unless you overwrite NetBSD and
reinstall using only part of the disk).

Which would you like to do?
}

message wdtype
{What kind of disk is %s?}

message sectforward
{Does your disk do AUTOMATIC sector forwarding?}

message dlgeom
{It appears that your disk, %s, has already been labeled with a BSD 
disklabel and the disklabel reports geometry that is different from
the real geometry.  The two geometries are:

disklabel: %d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors
real geom: %d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors
}

message part_head
{No	Start(%s)	Size(%s)	End(%s)	Kind\n}

message setbiosgeom
{You will be prompted for the geometry.  Please enter the values you
want.  The number of cylinders should be <= 1024 and the number of sectors
should be <= 63. If you have the BIOS set up to use > 1024 cylinders just
truncate that number to 1024 here; NetBSD will know about the rest of the
cylinders.

}

message confirmbiosgeom
{Please verify if the BIOS disk geometry below is correct. The value for
the number of cylinders may have been truncated to 1024. This is ok as
long as the other numbers are correct; only 1024 cylinders can be
specified in the MBR, the rest will be found in a different way by NetBSD.

If you reenter the values, make sure that the values are correct and
match those used by other systems on this disk. Values that do not match
may result in data corruption.

}

message badgeom
{The current values for your disk geometry are:

}

message realgeom
{real geom: %d cyl, %d heads, %d sec  (NB: for comparison only)\n}

message biosgeom
{BIOS geom: %d cyl, %d heads, %d sec\n}

message reentergeom
{The values just entered for the geometry are not usable.  Please,
reenter the geometry.
}

message ovrwrite
{Your disk currently has a non-NetBSD partition.  Do you really want to
overwrite that partition with NetBSD?
}

message parttable
{The partition table on your disk currently looks like the following:
}

message editpart
{Partition %d looks like:\n\n}

message editparttable
{Edit your DOS partition table.  The highlighted partition is the currently
active partition.   The partition table currently looks like:

}

message reeditpart
{There are overlapping MBR partitions or there is not exactly one NetBSD
partition. You should reedit the MBR partition table.

Do you want to reedit it?
}

message nobsdpart
{There is no NetBSD partition in the MBR partition table.}

message multbsdpart
{There are multiple NetBSD partitions in the MBR partition table.
Partition %d will be the one used.}

message dofdisk
{Setting up the DOS partition table ...
}

message dobad144
{Installing the bad block table ...
}

message dobootblks
{Installing boot blocks on %s....
}

message askfsroot1
{I will be asking for partition information.

First the root partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
}

message askfsroot2
{Root partition size? }

message askfsswap1
{
Next the swap partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
}

message askfsswap2
{Swap partition size? }

message otherparts
{You still have some space remaining unallocated on your disk.  Please
give sizes and mount points for the following partitions.

}

message askfspart1
{The next partition is /dev/%s%c.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
}

message askfspart2
{Partition size? }

message cyl1024
{The disklabel (set of partitions) you specified has a root partition that
ends beyond the 1024 BIOS cylinder boundary. To be sure that the system
can be booted at all times, the entire root partition must lie below that
limit. You can either: }

message onebiosmatch
{This disk matches the following BIOS disk:

BIOS #	cyl.	heads	sectors\n}

message biosmultmatch
{This disk matches the following BIOS disks:

	BIOS #	cyl.	heads	sectors\n}

message pickdisk
{Choose disk: }

message wmbrfail
{Rewrite of MBR failed. I can't continue.}

message partabovechs
{The NetBSD part of the disk lies outside of the range that the BIOS on
your machine can address. Booting from it may not be possible. Are you
sure you that you want to do this?

(Answering 'no' will take you back to the partition edit menu.)}

message installbootsel
{You appear to have more than one operating system installed on your
disk. Do you want to install a bootselector so that you can select
which system to start up when your computer is (re)started?}

message installmbr
{The start of the NetBSD part of the disk lies outside of the range
that the BIOS can address. The initial bootcode in the Master Boot
Record needs to be able to use the extended BIOS interface to boot
off this partition. Do you want to install the NetBSD bootcode into
the Master Boot Record so that this is ensured? Note that this will
overwrite the existing code in the MBR, like some bootselectors.}

message configbootsel
{Configure the different bootselection menu items. You can change the
simple menu entries for the matching partition entries that are displayed
when the system boots. Also, you can specify the timeout and default
action to be taken (if no selection is made in the bootmenu).\n}

{Boot menu timeout: %d\n}
