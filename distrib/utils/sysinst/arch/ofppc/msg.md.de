adressierbaren Bereichs. Eventuell können Sie von dieser Partition nicht
booten. Sind Sie sicher, daß Sie fortfahren möchten?

(Antworten Sie mit 'nein' um die Partitionen erneut zu editieren.)}

message nobootpart
{There is no boot partition in the MBR partition table.}

message boottoosmall
{The boot partition is too small.  It needs to be at least 2MB in size,
however a size of at least 100MB is reccomended.}

message nobootpartdisklabel
{There is no boot partition in the disklabel.  The boot partition should
match the boot partition you set up in the MBR partition table.}

message preptoosmall
{You need to have two PReP partitions to boot an IBM RS/6000.  One needs to
be at least 1MB in size, and the other must be at least 1KB in size.}

message bootnotright
{In order to boot ofppc, you need either a FAT12 partition of at least 2MB
in size, or a pair of PReP partitions.  The PReP partitions need to be at
least 1KB, and 1MB in size.  IBM RS/6000 machines generally need the PReP
partitions, however some can utilize the FAT12.  Most other machines require
the FAT12 partition.  If you are not sure which to choose, accept the
defaults, and install all three.  You do not currently have any partitions
that meet the minimum requirements.}
