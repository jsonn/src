message hello
{Welcome to sysinst, the NetBSD-@@VERSION@@ system installation tool.
This menu-driven tool is designed to help you install NetBSD to a hard
disk, or upgrade an existing NetBSD system, with a minimum of work.
In the following menus, you may change the current selection by
either typing the reference letter (a, b, c, ...).  Arrow keys may also work.
You activate the current selection from the menu by typing the enter key.

If you booted from a floppy, you may now remove the disk.

Thank you for using NetBSD!
}

message installusure
{You have chosen to install NetBSD on your hard disk.  This will change
information on your hard disk.  You should have made a full backup
before this procedure!  This procedure will do the following things:
	a) Partition your disk
	b) Create new BSD file systems
	c) Load and install distribution sets

(After you enter the partition information but before your disk is 
changed, you will have the opportunity to quit this procedure.)
Shall we continue?  
}

message upgradeusure
{Ok, lets upgrade NetBSD on your hard disk.  As always, this will
change information on your hard disk.  You should have made a full backup
before this procedure!  Do you really want to upgrade NetBSD?
(This is your last warning before this procedure starts modifying your
disks.)
}

message reinstallusure
{Ok, lets unpack the NetBSD distribution sets to a bootable hard disk.
This procedure just fetches and unpacks sets onto an pre-partitioned
bootable disk. It does not label disks, upgrade bootblocks, or save
any existing configuration info.  (Quit and choose `install' or
`upgrade' if you want those options.)  You should have already done an
`install' or `upgrade' before starting this procedure!

Do you really want to re-install  NetBSD dstribution sets?
(This is your last warning before this procedure starts modifying your
disks.)
}


message nodisk

message pleasemountroot
{The root device is not mounted.  Please mount it.

Your selected target disk %s also holds the current root device.  I
need to know whether I'm currently running out of the target root
(%sa), or out of an alternate root (say, in %sb, your swap partition).
I can't tell unless you mount the root.

I'm aborting back to the main menu so you can fork a subshell.

message scsigeom1
{It appears that your disk, %s, has already been labeled with a BSD 
disklabel and the disklabel reports geometry that is different from
the the real geometry.  Also, the reported geometry does not address all
possible sectors on your disk.  Your disk has %d sectors.

disklabel: %d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors = %d total sectors
reported geom: %d cylinders, %d heads, %d sectors = %d total sectors

It may be possible to choose a fake geometry for your BSD disklabel that
addresses most of your sectors.

for fake geometries.  At least the last one is the reported geometry.

message layout
{You need to choose how the NetBSD part of your disk will be partitioned.
You have several choices.  They are summarized below.
-- Standard: the partitions are computed by this program.
-- Standard with X: twice the swap space, space for X binaries.
-- Custom: you specify the sizes of all the partitions.

The NetBSD part of your disk is %.2f Megabytes.
Standard requires at least %.2f Megabytes.
Standard with X requires at least %.2f Megabytes.
}

message sizechoice
{You have elected to choose your partition sizes.  You need to specify
the units of size you will use for your choices.  Choosing megabytes
will make partition sizes close to your choice, but keep partitions
to an integral number of cylinders.   Choosing sectors will allow you
to most acurately specify the sizes, but remember, it is most efficient
to choose partition sizes that are exact multiples of your cylinder
size, which is %d sectors.

written a disklabel to the target disk, and newfs'ed and fsck'ed
the new partitions you specified for the target disk.

If the target filesystems look good, the next step is to fetch and
unpack the distribution filesets.  Press <return> to proceed.

The program "%s" failed unexpectedly with return code %s.

This is probably due to choosing the incorrect top-level install
option---like trying to do an Upgrade on a bare disk, or doing a fresh
Install on an already-running system.  Or it might be due to a
mispackaged miniroot.  Whatever the cause, sysinst did not expect any
errors here and the installation has almost certainly failed.

One way is to start a shell from the Utilities menu, examine the

you can rm -f etc.old and restart.  Or if /etc.old is from a recent,
incomplete upgrade, you can rm -f /etc and mv etc.old to /etc.
