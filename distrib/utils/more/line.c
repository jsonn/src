 * A ridiculously complex state machine takes care of backspaces.  The

 * involving long lines with underlining, boldfacing or whatever.  There
 * are still some cases which will break it.
 *
 * There are four states:
 *	LN_NORMAL is the normal state (not in underline mode).
 *	LN_UNDERLINE means we are in underline mode.  We expect to get
 *		either a sequence like "_\bX" or "X\b_" to continue
 *		underline mode, or anything else to end underline mode.
 *	LN_BOLDFACE means we are in boldface mode.  We expect to get sequences
 *		like "X\bX\b...X\bX" to continue boldface mode, or anything
 *		else to end boldface mode.
 *	LN_UL_X means we are one character after LN_UNDERLINE
 *		(we have gotten the '_' in "_\bX" or the 'X' in "X\b_").
 *	LN_UL_XB means we are one character after LN_UL_X 
 *		(we have gotten the backspace in "_\bX" or "X\b_";
 *		we expect one more ordinary character, 
 *		which will put us back in state LN_UNDERLINE).
 *	LN_BO_X means we are one character after LN_BOLDFACE
 *		(we have gotten the 'X' in "X\bX").
 *	LN_BO_XB means we are one character after LN_BO_X
 *		(we have gotten the backspace in "X\bX";
 *		we expect one more 'X' which will put us back
 *		in LN_BOLDFACE).
