NetBSD 1.2 is the second public release of NetBSD for the DECstation
and DECsystem family of computers.  This release includes kernel
support for ELF shared libraries, much of which is due to work by Per
Fogelstrom (pefo@OpenBSD.ORG).  Note that NetBSD/1.2 pmax still ships
with statically-linked user binaries.  Ultrix emulation for tty-aware
applications is improved over NetBSD 1.1.  Many NetBSD/pmax bugs have
been fixed, including annoying bugs in the 4.4bsd-Lite/pmax SCSI
drivers.
