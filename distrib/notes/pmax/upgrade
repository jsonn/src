It may be possible to easily upgrade your existing NetBSD/pmax system
using the upgrade program in the miniroot.

	NOTE: this has not been tested and should be done with caution,
	after backing up your system.

If you wish to upgrade your system by this method, simply select
the `upgrade' option once the miniroot has booted.  The upgrade program
with then guide you through the procedure.  The upgrade program will:

	* Enable the network based on your system's current
	  network configuration.

	* Mount your existing filesystems.

	* Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.

	* Fixup your system's existing /etc/fstab, changing the
	  occurrences of `ufs' to `ffs' and let you edit the
	  resulting file.

	* Make new device nodes in your root filesystem.

	* Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.
	  NOTE: the existing kernel WILL NOT be backed up; doing
	  so would be pointless, since older NetBSD kernels will
	  not work correctly with all NetBSD _VER executables.

	* Install a new boot block.

	* Check your filesystems for integrity.

While using the miniroot's upgrade program is the preferred method
of upgrading your system, it is possible to upgrade your system
manually.  To do this, follow the following procedure:

	* Place _at least_ the `base' binary set in a filesystem
	  accessible to the target machine.  A local filesystem
	  is preferred, since there may be incompatibilities
	  between the NetBSD _VER kernel and older route(8)
	  binaries.

	* Back up your pre-existing kernel and copy the _VER
	  kernel into your root partition.

	* Reboot with the _VER kernel into single-user mode.

	* Check all filesystems:

		/sbin/fsck -p

	* Mount all local filesystems:

		/sbin/mount -a -t nonfs

	* If you keep /usr or /usr/share on an NFS server, you
	  will want to mount those filesystems as well.  To do
	  this, you will need to enable the network:

		sh /etc/netstart

	  NOTE: the route(8) commands may fail due to potential
	  incompatibilities between route(8) and the NetBSD _VER
	  kernel.  Once you have enabled the network, mount the
	  NFS filesystems.  If you use amd(8), you may or may not
	  have to mount these filesystems manually.  Your mileage
	  may vary.

	* Make sure you are in the root filesystem and extract
	  the `base' binary set:

		cd /
		tar --unlink -zxvpf /path/to/base13.tar.gz

	  NOTE: the `--unlink' option is _very_ important!

	* Sync the filesystems:

		sync

	* At this point you may extract any other binary sets
	  you may have placed on local filesystems, or you may
	  wish to extract additional sets at a later time.
	  To extract these sets, use the following commands:

		cd /
		tar --unlink -zxvpf <path to set>

NOTE: you SHOULD NOT extract the `etc' set if upgrading.  Instead, you
should extract that set into another area and carefully merge the changes
by hand.
