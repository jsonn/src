The preferred upgrade path is to set up a diskless-boot host, unpack
and boot boot 1.3 diskimage as for a network installation, and to use
the sysinst tool to upgrade your system.   Please see the `Installation'
section for  further information.


Upgrade via diskimage.
----------------------

If you cannot netboot, the recommended path is to upgrade by booting a
diskimage from your swap partition.  Pmaxes cannot boot out out of
anything but the 'a' partition. However, you *can* boot an upgrade
kernel off your 'a' partition and tell that kernel  to use your
'b' partition as its root.  The steps to do this
(after you've  fetched the diskimage) with a current root of rzX are:

	1) boot single-user from your current root, rzX.
	    Be *sure* not to start swapping:

		>> boot -f rz(0,X,0)netbsd -s 		# 3100
		>> boot 5/rzX/netbsd -s 		# 5000/200
		>> boot 3/rzX/netbsd -s 		# others

	(NOTE: replace the X with the unit number of your disk:
         boot 3/rz2/netbsd to boot drive 2 on a 5000/xxx.)

	2) When you get a single-user prompt,  remount the
	   root filesystem read-write. (You wil need to update the
	   kernel soon.)

		# mount /

	   Then mount the filesystem with the diskimage, and
	   uncompress and dd the diskimage into swap (b) partition.
	   You will also need /usr mounted to run gunzip:

		# mount /usr
		# gunzip -c diskimage.gz | dd bs=10240 of=/dev/rrzXb

	3) Mount swap (b) partition readonly on /mnt:
		# mount -r -t ffs /dev/rzXb /mnt

	4) Copy  the kernel from the B partition to your root:
		cp -p  /mnt/netbsd /netbsd-1.3
	   (this is important; you want the kernel in / and  swap
	   to be a release kernel, or the release binaries will not work.)

	5) halt:
		# halt

	6) Reboot with an argument of "n", telling the kernel to
	   ask what device to use as  root:

		>> boot -f rz(0,X,0)netbsd-1.3 n 	# 3100
		>> boot 5/rzX/netbsd-1.3 n	 	# 5000/200
		>> boot 3/rzX/netbsd-1.3 n 		# others

	(NOTE: the n after the kernel name is a literal "n",
	 not the disk unit number or partition. 
	 It is an argument telling the kernel to ask for a root device.
	 NOTE: replace the X with the unit number of your disk:
         boot 3/rz2/netbsd to boot drive 2 on a 5000/xxx.)


	7) The "n" argument tells the kernel to prompt you for
	   the  root device, dump device, and root fileysystem type.
	     Enter when the kernel asks for
		Root device:

	Tell it rzXb, where X is the same disk unit as in step 6.
	Here's an example, again assuming drive  2 as in step 6:

	KN03-AA V5.2b    (PC: 0x80051f1c, SP: 0xffffdeb0)
	>> boot 3/rz2/netbsd n

		boot device: rz2
	root device (default rz2a): 
	        <<< enter `rz2b' >>>
	dump device (default rz2b): 
	        <<< enter `none' >>>
	file system (default generic): 
	        <<< enter `ffs' >>>
	root on rz2b


then continue from the ``Once you've booted the diskimage'' step of
the Installation instructions.
