If at all possible, you should consult the ``Installation Guide''
document on the NetBSD/pmax web page, at http://www.netbsd.org/ports/pmax.
Installing NetBSD is a relatively complex process, but if you have
the above document in hand it shouldn't be too much trouble.

It has not been possible to reproduce the pmax installation Web page
in fixed-font hardcopy format for the _VER release.  You must either visit
the URL above, or request a rendered version (e.g, PostScript).

Please follow the dinstructions at 

    http://www.netbsd.org/ports/pmax/pmax-install.html,

now,and return to this document when you used those instructions
to  install a miniroot, label a disk, and extract the NetBSD/pmax _VER
installation tar sets.



Post-intallation notes:
----------------------
Some of the files in the NetBSD _VER distribution might need to be
tailored for your site.  In particular, the /etc/sendmail.cf file will
almost definitely need to be adjusted, and other files in /etc will
probably need to be modified.  If you are unfamiliar with UN*X-like
system administration, it's recommended that you buy a book that
discusses it.
