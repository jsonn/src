web page, at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/pmax .
.Note)
.Pp
To install or upgrade NetBSD, you need to first boot an installation
program and then interact with the screen-menu program
.Ic sysinst .
The installation program actually consists of the NetBSD kernel plus
an in-memory file system of utility programs.
.Pp
From most convenient to least convenient, the installation methods
are:
.Bl -enum
.It
Installation from an existing NetBSD or Ultrix system by booting the
install kernel from an existing root filesystem.  See the
.Sx Installing from an existing system
section later in these INSTALL notes.
.It
Copying a bootable diskimage onto the beginning of a disk and installing
onto that disk.  See the
.Sx Install via diskimage
section later in these INSTALL notes.
.It
Booting the install kernel over the network and installing onto a local
disk.  See the
.Sx Install via netboot install kernel
section later in these INSTALL notes.
.It
Using a helper machine with a SCSI controller to copy the bootable
diskimage onto the beginning of a disk, and moving the disk to the
target machine.  See the
.Sx Install via diskimage
section later in these INSTALL notes.
.It
For machines with some PROMs that cannot netboot standard kernels, you
will need to set up an NFS server with a diskless root filesystem for
trimmed-down network install kernel and run the installation system from
the NFS root filesystem. See the
.Sx Install via diskless boot
section later in these INSTALL notes.
.El
.Pp
You should familiarize yourself with the console PROM environment
and the hardware configuration. The PROMs on the older DECstation
2100 and 3100 use one syntax. The PROMs on the TurboChannel machines
use a completely different syntax.  Be sure you know how to print
the configuration of your machine, and how to boot from disk or
network, as appropriate.
.Pp
On the 2100/3100, that's
.Bd -literal -offset indent
boot -f rz(0,N,0)netbsd (boot from rzN)
boot -f tftp()          (boot diskless via TFTP)
boot -f mop()           (boot via MOP from an Ultrix server)
.Ed
On the 5000/200, the equivalent is
.Bd -literal -offset indent
boot 5/rzN/netbsd
boot 6/tftp
boot 6/mop
.Ed
And on other  5000 series machines,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
boot 3/rzN/netbsd
boot 3/tftp
boot 3/mop
.Ed
You will also need to know the total size (in sectors) and the
approximate geometry of the disks you are installing onto, so that you
can label your disks for the BSD fast filesystem (FFS).  For most SCSI
drives (including all SCSI-2 drives), the kernel will correctly detect
the disk geometry. The
.Ic sysinst
tool will suggest these as the default.
.Pp
If you're installing NetBSD/pmax for the first time it's a very
good idea to pre-plan partition sizes for the disks on which you're
installing NetBSD.  Changing the size of partitions after you've
installed is difficult.  If you do not have a spare bootable disk, it
may be simpler to re-install NetBSD again from scratch.
.Pp
Assuming a classic partition scheme with separate root (`/') and /usr
filesystems, a comfortable size for the NetBSD root filesystem partition
is about 32M.  A good initial size for the swap partition is twice the
amount of physical memory in your machine (though, unlike Ultrix, there
are no restrictions on the size of the swap partition that would render
part of your memory unusable).  The default swap size is 64Mbytes, which
is adequate for doing a full system build.  A full binary installation,
with X11R6.3, takes about 150MB in `/usr' - a 200MB `/usr' should be
ample.
.
.Ss2 Install\ via\ a\ NetBSD\ CDROM
.
You can obtain the disk image or diskless boot tar file from the
.Nx \*V
.Tn CDROM .
.Pp
To mount the CDROM from a NetBSD/pmax host, type
.D1 Ic mount\ -r\ -t\ cd9660\ /dev/rz Ns Ar X Ns Ic c\ /mnt
and from an Ultrix host
.D1 Ic mount\ -r\ -t\ cdfs\ -o\ nodefperm,noversion\ /dev/rz Ns Ar X Ns Ic c\ /mnt
.No where Ar X
is the SCSI id of the CDROM.
.(Note
Ultrix does not have Rock Ridge extensions so leave out everything
between the first and last period (.) in the paths on the CD.  For
example, the path
.Pa NetBSD-1.3.2
would show up as
.Pa NetBSD-1.2 .
.Note)
.Pp
The diskimage file can be found on the CDROM at the following location
(relative to the mount point of the CD)
.Dl pmax/installation/diskimage/diskimage.gz
and the diskless boot tar file can be found at
.Dl pmax/installation/netboot/diskimage.tgz
Once you have located these files, continue on to either
.Sx Install via netboot install kernel ,
.Sx Install via diskless boot ,
.Sx Install via diskimage
or
.Sx Installing from an existing system
section later in the INSTALL notes.
.
.Ss2 Installing from an existing system
.
.(Note
If you are installing NetBSD using an existing NetBSD system that
is older than NetBSD-1.4, you will need to install new bootblocks
before installing NetBSD-\*V.  New bootblocks are in the
tar file:
.Dl pmax/installation/misc/bootblocks.tgz
in the NetBSD-\*V distribution.  To install the new bootblocks,
use the following commands:
.D1 # Ic "cd /
.D1 # Ic "tar xvpfz .../pmax/installation/misc/bootblocks.tgz
.D1 # Ic "disklabel -B rzX
where X is your boot disk SCSI ID.
.Note)
.Pp
With new NetBSD bootblocks or using the Ultrix bootloader,
you can boot the kernel located in:
.Dl pmax/binary/kernel/install.gz
On Ultrix systems you will need to gunzip this kernel before booting it.
A copy of the gunzip binary for Ultrix systems is located in:
.Dl pmax/installation/misc/gunzip.ultrix
.Pp
Then boot using:
.D1 >> Ic "boot -f rz(0,X,0)install
.D1 >> Ic "boot 5/rzX/install
or
.D1 >> Ic "boot 3/rzX/install
where X is your boot disk SCSI ID, and continue to the
.Sx Once you've booted the diskimage
section
.
.Ss2 Install via diskimage
.
The diskimage file is in
.Dl pmax/installation/diskimage/diskimage.gz .
It is shipped compressed and is around 1150 kbytes, uncompressing to
exactly 2 Mbytes.
.Pp
To install the diskimage onto disk rzX on a NetBSD/pmax system, do:
.D1 Ic disklabel -W /dev/rrzXc
.D1 Ic gunzip -c diskimage.gz\ |\ dd of=/dev/rrzXc bs=10240
.Pp
When installing on a disk with no NetBSD or Ultrix label, you may get a
message like:
.Dl rzX: WARNING: trying Ultrix label, no disk label
or when installing on an old Ultrix disk, you may get a message like:
.Dl rzX: WARNING: using ULTRIX partition information
when issuing the "disklabel -W /dev/rrzXc" command.  This can safely be
ignored.
.Pp
Most other NetBSD ports are similar, but use rsdXc instead of rrzXc.
.Pp
On NetBSD/i386, the `raw disk partition' is the 'd' parttion, so do:
.D1 Ic disklabel -W /dev/rsdXd
.D1 Ic gunzip -c diskimage.gz\ |\ dd of=/dev/rsdXd bs=10240
.Pp
On NetBSD, be sure to use
.Ic disklabel -W
to enable writing to the label
area of the disk. If you forget this and/or use the `block' device,
the dd command may silently fail.
.Pp
On Ultrix systems, do:
.D1 Ic gunzip -c diskimage.gz\ |\ dd of=/dev/rrzXc bs=10240
A copy of the gunzip program is located in
.Dl pmax/installation/misc/gunzip.ultrix
if you do not already have it.
.Pp
On MS-DOS, use an unzip utlility, then use rawrite.
.Pp
Then boot using:
.D1 >> Ic "boot -f rz(0,X,0)install
.D1 >> Ic "boot 5/rzX/install
or
.D1 >> Ic "boot 3/rzX/install
where X is your boot disk SCSI ID, and continue to the
.Sx Once you've booted the diskimage
section.
.
.Ss2 Install via netboot install kernel
.
Booting NetBSD/pmax \*V install kernel over a network requires a BOOTP
or DHCP server and a TFTP server.  (These are usually all run on the
same machine.)  There are two basic stages to the boot:
.Pp
.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The pmax PROM software sends a BOOTP request to get its own address, the
address of the TFTP server and the file to download.
.It
It downloads the file name obtained from BOOTP, which is the install
kernel, via TFTP and then executes it.
.El
.
.Pp
You will need to set up servers for BOOTP and TFTP.
.Pp
For the BOOTP server you need to specify the:
.Pp
.
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
hardware type (Ethernet)
.It
hardware address (Ethernet MAC address)
.It
IP address of the client
.It
subnet mask of the client
.It
address of the TFTP server
.It
name of the kernel loaded via TFTP
.El
.
.Pp
Here's an example for a Unix system running bootpd:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
myhost.mydom.com:\e
	 :ht=ethernet:ha=08002b123456:\e
	 :ip=192.168.1.2:sm=255.255.255.0:\e
	 :sa=192.168.1.1:bf=install:
.Ed
And here's an example for a Unix system running the ISC dhcpd:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
host pmax {
	hardware ethernet 08:0:2b:12:34:56;
	fixed-address 192.168.1.2;
	option host-name "myhost.mydom.com";
	filename "install";
	option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
	option broadcast-address 255.255.255.0;
	option domain-name "my.domain";
}
.Ed
.Pp
For the TFTP server, You will need to copy the
.Ic install
kernel to the directory used by the TFTP server.  This file must be
gunziped.
.Pp
Then boot using:
.D1 >> Ic "boot -f tftp()
.D1 >> Ic "boot 6/tftp
or
.D1 >> Ic "boot 3/tftp
.Pp
and continue to the
.Sx Once you've booted the diskimage
section.
.
.Ss2 Install via diskless boot
.
The file
.Dl pmax/installation/netboot/diskimage.tar.gz
contains a suitable set of files for installing on an NFS server to set
up a diskless root filesytem.  (It is a tar copy of the contents of an
installation ramdisk filesystem contained in the install kernel.)  You
will need to find an NFS server, unpack the tarfile, and setup
BOOTP/dhcp service for your pmax.  Instructions for setting up
an NFS server and diskless booting are on the NetBSD/pmax netboot
webpage at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/pmax/netboot.html
.Pp
Since the system install utility, sysinst, requires a read/write root,
installing via diskless boot is only feasible if your NFS server exports
the diskless root read-write.  If this is not possible, you should
install via other of the other installation procedures.
.Pp
Once you have booted the kernel, continue to the
.Sx Once you've booted the diskimage
section.
.
.Ss2 Once you've booted the diskimage
.
Once you'e booted the installation kernel you will need to
select your terminal type.  Use
.Ic pmax
for a framebuffer console,
.Ic vt100
for a serial console with a vt100-compatible terminal, or
.Ic xterm
or
.Ic xterms
for a 
.Xr tip 1
or
.Xr cu 1
connection running in an
.Xr xterm 1 .
.Pp
The system will then start the
.Ic sysinst
program.
.so ../common/sysinst
