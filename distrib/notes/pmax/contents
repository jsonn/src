The pmax-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"pmax" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/pmax/
			binary/		pmax binary distribution sets
					and kernel images;
					see below.

			installation/	installation materials:
					disk images of a complete root
					filesystem,  for both network and
					diskful installation; see below.

			misc/		miscellaneous binaries including
					a copy of the sysinst instalation tool.

The NetBSD/pmax binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD _VER release for the pmax.  There are eight binary
distribution sets, plus optional X11 sets.  The binary distribution
sets can be found in the "pmax/binary/sets" subdirectory of the NetBSD
_VER distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base	The NetBSD/pmax _VER base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		does NOT include shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 11.6M gzipped ]

	comp	The NetBSD/pmax Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C and C++.  This set includes the system
		include files (/usr/include), the linker, the compiler
		tool chain, and the various system libraries (except
		the shared libraries, which are included as part of the
		base set).  This set also includes the manual pages for
		all of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 10.9M gzipped ]

	etc	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 53K gzipped ]

	games	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 3.0M gzipped ]

	kern	This set is a placeholder for bootable kernels.

	man	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.6M gzipped ]

	misc	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.9M gzipped,  8.3M uncompressed ]

	text	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1.1M gzipped, 3.7M uncompressed ]




The pmax security distribution set is named "secr" and can be found in
the "pmax/binary/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER
distribution tree.  It contains security related binaries which depend
on cryptographic source code. You do not need this distribution set to
use encrypted passwords in your password file; the "base" distribution
includes a crypt library which can perform only the decryption
function.  The security distribution includes a version of the
Kerberos IV network security system, and a Kerberized version of the
"telnet" program.  The "secr" distribution set can be found only on
those sites which carry the complete NetBSD distribution and which can
legally obtain it.  (Remember, because of United States law, it may
not be legal to distribute this set to locations outside of the United
States and Canada.)

At the time of release, the pmax distribution set does not include a
security distribution.  A binary will be built shortly after the
release by a US permanent resident. In the meantime, if you are in the
US or Canada and want the security distribution you must get the
security source distribution and recompile libcrypt.a and recompile
the following programs:

	ed, ftpd, makekey, rexecd, uucpd, init, lock, login, passwd,
	skeyinit, su, tn3270, pppd




Since NetBSD 1.3, binary sets for the X Window system are also
distributed with each NetBSD release. The binaries are based on
X11R6.3 and can be installed using the 'sysinst' utility.


	xbase	The basic files needed for a complete X
		client environment. This does not include
		the X servers.
		[ 3.25M gzipped ]

	xcomp	The extra libraries and include files needed
		to compile X source code.
		[ 2.1M gzipped, 7.3M uncompressed ]

	xcontrib	Programs that were contributed to X.
		[ 216 gzipped ]

	xfont	Fonts needed by X.
		[ 5.8M gzipped, 7M uncompressed ]

	xserver	X servers built from X11R5, supporting the 4.3bsd-derived
		Xserver/framebuffer protocol used in NetBSD/pmax.
		See the /usr/X11R6/bin/README.pmax  file in this set for
		more information on conifguring the X11 R5 servers to
		work with X11R6 clients and with compressed fonts.

		[ 712k gzipped, 2.4 unzipped ]


The pmax binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files.
Each pmax binary distribution set also has its own "CKSUMS" file, just
as the source distribution sets do.

The initial installation of NetBSD _VER on a Decstation not already running
NetBSD _VER is supported by the following files, which are  included in 
the `./installation' subdirectory:

	diskimage/diskimage.gz
			A gzipped copy of a full root filesystem.
			When unzipped, this is suitable for dd'ing
			onto a raw disk partition.


	netboot/diskimage.tar.gz
			A gzipped copy of a tar file containing the same 
			files as diskimage.gz. When unzipped, this is
			suitable for setting up an NFS server for diskless
			boot or installing via netboot.

Distribution kernel images (e.g., for installalling on Ultrix) are
also available separately in the ./binary/kernel subdirectory:

	netbsd.aout	An a.out-format generic kernel, bootable on an
			existing NetBSD system.

	netbsd.ecoff	An ECOFF-format kernel, suitable for diskless boot
			via TFTP  or for upgrading from Ultrix.


	nfsnetbsd.ecoff	An minimal ECOFF-format kernel, minimized to
			boot on bugggy PROMs that cannot boot kernels
			larger than ~1 Mbyte.


The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the "tar xvfp"
from /.  Also note that if you upgrade or install this way, those
programs that you are using at the time will NOT be replaced.  If you
follow the normal installation or upgrade procedures, this will be
taken care of for you.
