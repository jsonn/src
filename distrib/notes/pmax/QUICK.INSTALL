NetBSD 1.3.3 includes the install materials on CD.  However, we cannot
make a single CD bootable on a dozen systems, so the CD cannot be
booted directly in a DECstation.  If your DECstation already has an OS
installed and has a CD-ROM drive, you can install NetBSD by mounting the
CD and copying a miniroot to your swap partition.

NOTE: You should still read the INSTALL notes at the top of the pmax
section of the CD or FTP area (in the same directory as these quick
installation notes).  There will be information in the INSTALL notes
that is not covered here.


In the following instructions, lines starting with a # character are
comments and are not typed in.  It is also assumed that your CD-ROM
drive is at SCSI id 4, and your disk is at SCSI id 0.


NOTE FOR ULTRIX UPGRATES:
You will need the existing Ultrix root filesystem at least 24MB in size
(32MB is preferable), and the following swap partition to be at least
32MB (to fit the miniroot).  Remember to use the same root filesystem
size and swap partition offset when you set up your disk layout in
sysinst.  Writing down the output of 'chpt -q /dev/rrzXc' would be a
good idea.  If you have a smaller root filesystem, but extra room in
your swap partition (for example a 16MB root filesystem but a 48MB
swap partition), you can move the start of the swap partition forward
and leave a "gap" between the existing root filesystem and the swap
partition.  If you have any questions, send them to the NetBSD/pmax
mailling list at port-pmax@NetBSD.ORG .


Under Ultrix, do:

    # Boot into single user mode
    boot -f rz(0,0,0)vmunix			# on 2100, 3100
    boot 5/rz0/vmunix				# on 5000/200
    boot 3/rz0/vmunix				# on all other models

    # At the single-user root prompt
    mkdir -p /cdrom
    mount -r -t cdfs -o nodefperm,noversion /dev/rz4c /cdrom
    # NOTE: Ultrix doesn't have rock ridge extensions, so leave out
    #       everything between the first and last . in the paths on
    #       the CD.

From an earlier version of NetBSD (or OpenBSD), do:

    # At the single-user root prompt

    mount -r /usr			# if /usr is on a separate filesystem
    mkdir -p /cdrom
    mount -r -t cd9660 /dev/rz4c /cdrom

    # Check that your swap partition is at least 32Mbytes
    disklabel rz0

If your machine has Ultrix and your network bandwith can sustain FTPing
10 Megabytes to get the initial diskimage, you can fetch the diskimage
via FTP.  Something similar will also work for a network connected
NetBSD machine - the main change would be to not get the Ultrix version
of gunzip from the FTP site.

    # While still in multi-user mode, ftp files to a local filesystem

    # check for 12MB free space - need ~2MB on / and ~10MB on
    # /place/for/files
    df
    cd /place/for/files
    # Connect to the NetBSD ftp archive or whatever your local
    # "mirror" site is.
