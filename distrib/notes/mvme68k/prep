mvme68k machines usually need little or no preparation before installing
.Nx "" ,
other than the usual, well advised precaution of
.Em backing up all data
on any attached storage devices.
.Pp
The following instructions should make your machine "NetBSD Ready".
.Pp
Power-up your MVME147 board. You should have the 
.Em bug No prompt:
.Bdlit

COLD Start

Onboard  RAM start = $00000000,  stop = $007FFFFF

147-Bug\*>

.Ed
Or, if you have an MVME167 board:
.Bdlit

MVME167 Debugger/Diagnostics Release Version 2.3 - 02/25/94
COLD Start

Local Memory Found =02000000 (&33554432)

MPU Clock Speed =33Mhz

167-Bug\*>

.Ed
Make sure the RAM size looks ok (if you've got an 8Mb MVME147 or a
32Mb MVME167 you should
have the same value as I do). Also make sure the clock is ticking:
.Pp
.Dl 1x7-Bug\*> Ns Ic time
.Dl Sunday   12/21/31   16:25:14
.Dl 1x7-Bug\*> Ns Ic time
.Dl Sunday   12/21/31   16:25:15
.Dl 1x7-Bug\*>
.Pp
Note that
.Nx
bases its year at 1968, and adds the year offset in
the MVME1x7's real-time clock to get the current year. So the '31' here
equates to 1999. You may have to adjust your clock using the 'set'
command to comply with
.Nx "" 's
requirements. Don't worry if the "Day of the week" is not correct,
.Nx
doesn't use it.
Motorola has acknowledged a year 2000 bug in some versions of the MVME147
whereby the day of the week
doesn't get set correctly by the 147Bug PROM.
.Em It does not affect
.Nx "" !
.Pp
Also make sure that your board's ethernet address is initialised to
the correct value. You'll find the address on a label on the inside of
the MVME147's front panel, and on the VMEbus P2 connector of the MVME167.
On the MVME147, enter the last five digits of the address
using the 'lsad' command. On the MVME167, you should use the 'cnfg' command.
.Pp
To install successfully to a local SCSI disk, you need to ensure that
1x7Bug is aware of what targets are connected to the SCSI bus. This
can be done by issueing the following command:
.Pp
.Dl 1x7-Bug\*> Ic iot;t
.Pp
At this point, 1x7Bug will scan for any attached SCSI devices. After
a short delay, a list of SCSI devices will be displayed. 147Bug will
ask if LUNs should be assigned from SCSI ids, to which you should
answer Y. You should also answer Y when asked if the information is
to be saved to NVRAM. 167Bug does not prompt for this information.
.Pp
The following installation instructions will assume that your target
SCSI disk drive appears at SCSI-id 0. If you have a tape drive, the
instructions assume is is configured for SCSI-id 5. When the RAMDISK
root boots,
.Nx
will refer to these devices as 'sd0' and 'rst0'
respectively. You may wish to note these down; you'll be using them
a lot. :-)
