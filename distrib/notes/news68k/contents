.Ss2 Binary Distribution Sets
The
.Nx
\*m
binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the
.Nx \*V
release for the \*m. There are eight binary distribution
.ie r_pc532 sets.
.el .No sets and the Em security No distribution set.
The binary distribution sets can be found in the
.Pa \*m/binary/sets
subdirectory
of the
.Nx \*V
distribution tree, and are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width mmmmmmmmmmm -compact
.Pp
.It Sy base
The
.Nx \*V
.No \*m Sy base No binary distribution. You
.Em must
install this distribution set. It contains the base
.Nx
utilities that are necessary for the
system to run and be minimally functional. It
includes shared library support, and excludes
everything described below.
.br
.if r_news68k .Em 12.9M gzipped, 40.1M uncompressed
.Pp
.It Sy comp
Things needed for compiling programs. This set
includes the system include files
.Pq Pa /usr/include
and the various system libraries (except the shared
libraries, which are included as part of the
.Sy base
set). This set also includes the manual pages for
all of the utilities it contains, as well as the
system call and library manual pages.
.br
.if r_news68k .Em 13M gzipped, 50M uncompressed
.Pp
.It Sy etc
This distribution set contains the system
configuration files that reside in
.Pa /etc
and in several other places. This set
.Em must
be installed if you are installing the system from scratch, but should
.Em not
be used if you are upgrading. (If you are upgrading,
it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
.Em carefully
upgrade your configuration files by hand.)

.Nx
maintains its own set of sources for the X Window System in order to
assure tight integration and compatibility.
These sources are based on XFree86, and tightly track XFree86 releases.
They are currently equivalent to XFree86 3.3.6.
Binary sets for the X Window system are distributed with
.Nx .
.if r_news68k \{\
Unfortunately, there is no framebuffer support on NetBSD/news68k yet,
so we can only distribute the X clients this time.
.\}
The sets are:
.Bl -tag -width xcontribmmm
.It Sy xbase
The basic files needed for a complete X
client environment. This does not include
the X servers.
.br
.if r_news68k .Em 2.4M gzippeed, 7.7M uncompressed
.It Sy xcomp

.br
.if r_news68k .Em 1.6M gzipped, 6.8M uncompressed

.\"============================ MI DISCUSSION OF BINARY SETS
.
.Pp
The \*m binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .tgz , No e.g.
.Pa base.tgz .
.
.
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are /-relative and
therefore are extracted
.Em below
the current directory. That
is, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic tar xfp
command from /.
