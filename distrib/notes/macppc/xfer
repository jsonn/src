Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.Pp
.It
NFS
.It
FTP
.It
CD-ROM
.El
.(Note
Installing on a "bare" machine requires some bootable device; either an MO
drive or a floppy.  When the target has on-board Ethernet, NFS installation is
also available.
.Note)
.Pp
The procedure for transferring the distribution sets onto installation media
depends on the type of media.  Instructions for each type of media are given
below.
.Pp
In order to create installation media, you will need all the files and
subdirectories in these two directories:
.Pp
.Dl Pa \&.../NetBSD-\*V/macppc/installation
.Dl Pa \&.../NetBSD-\*V/macppc/binary
.
.Ss2 Boot/Install from NFS server:
.
If your machine has a disk and network connection and on-board Ethernet, it may
be convenient for you to install
.Nx
over the network.  This involves temporarily booting your machine over NFS,
just long enough so you can initialize its disk.  This method requires that you
have access to an NFS server on your network so you can configure it to support
diskless boot for your machine.  Configuring the NFS server is normally a task
for a system administrator, and is not trivial.
.Pp
If you are using a
.Nx
system as the boot-server, have a look at the
.Xr disklabel 8
manual page for guidlines on how to proceed with this.  If the server runs
another operating system, consult the documentation that came with it (i.e.
add_client(8) on SunOS).
.Pp
.
Since NetBSD/macppc does not have floppy disk support yet, you need MacOS or
another machine that can write the install kernel image to floppy.
