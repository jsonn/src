.
NetBSD/macppc \*V runs on PCI-based Power Macs and several compatibles.
The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~80M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (NetBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)
