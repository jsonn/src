.Ss2 Prepare yourself
.
Take a deep breath.
.Pp
Good.  Now, make sure you are reading the PDF (if available), PostScript,
or HTML version of this document, as the 
.Pa \&.txt No and Pa \&.more
versions lack important formatting information that will prevent you from
following the twisted path you must follow.  OK, good.  Now, print out
this document.
.Pp
While it's printing, get some coffee, relax a bit, and mentally prepare
yourself for something that promises to be confusing, frustrating, and
annoying.  If you assume the worst, you'll be pleasantly surprised when
everything works easier than you expected.  Also, forget everything you've
been told about installing 
.Nx*M No Ns .
.Pp
It's done printing?  Fine, now get a dark writing implement.
.Pp
The recommended installation procedure is as follows:
.(enum
Go to the 
.Nx*M
model support page and look up your model information and issues (I can't
stress this enough times).
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
.It
Spend about 15 minutes and read all the way through this document
once.  While you're reading, use the writing implement to cross out the
sections that do not apply to your model (or hilight the sections that do
depending on your preferences).
.Pp
.It
Now spend another 5 minutes and re-read this document, and mentally piece
together how you think you'll be installing onto your machine.  It may
help to take a blank piece of paper and write out an outline of the
procedure you think you'll be going through.
.Pp
.It
Now create your bootable media and media for the distribution sets.
.Pp
.It
Prepare your machine, depending on the instructions for your model.
.Pp
.It
Boot into Open Firmware, and verify that it has the version of Open
Firmware you think it does.  Also make sure that the other variables
are set correctly.
.Pp
.It
Figure out the correct boot command, and boot your machine from the
bootable media you just created.  If you're having trouble, be sure to
read the section on
.Sx Common Problems and Error Messages
.Pp
.It
Celebrate!  The worst is over, but you've still got some work to do.  Take
a break, maybe more coffee, maybe a quick walk around the block, whatever
turns your fancy.
.Pp
.It
Now use the installer to install the distribution sets onto your system
and do some initial configurations.
.Pp
.It
Figure out how to boot from the installed partition.  Boot into 
.Nx
for the first time.
.Pp
.It
Configure to your preferences, install your favorite packages, and have
fun with your new
.Nx*M
machine!
.enum)
.Pp
.(Note
You really actually truly do need to follow the procedure listed in this
document in the order that we describe.  These systems are rather
tricky to boot for the novice and expert alike.  Once you cross off the
sections that don't apply to you, it will make more sense.
.Note)
.(Note
If the instructions in a subsection below do not apply to 
.Em all
versions of Open Firmware, there will be a line listing which versions of
Open Firmware they apply to, such as:
.br
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open 
Firmware 2.4, Open Firmware 3)
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Updating your BootROM
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Open Firmware 3 systems have a rewritable BootROM. Go to the
.Sq Apple Software Updates
web site at
.Lk http://asu.info.apple.com/
and search for
.Sq firmware
and install the most recent version for your model.
.Pp
.(Note
The most recent BootROMs available (4.1.7 and 4.1.8) as of April 2001 are
known to have some problems.  Some PowerBook G4 users find they are
unable to boot 
.Nx
after upgrading, and some PowerMacintosh users find that their third-party 
RAM has been disabled.  See the discussion at
.Lk http://www.macfixit.com/archives/april.01.a.shtml#firm-04-07
.Note)
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Newer Models
.
(Open Firmware 3)
.Pp
Hold down a special key combination when your system boots.
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments).
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt on your screen:
.Pp
.(disp

.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Apple Network Servers
.
(Open Firmware 1.1.22)
.Pp
The version of Open Firmware in the
Apple Network Servers can only use a serial console.
You must first hook up a serial console
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking) to 
.Sq Port 2
(the
.Sq Li ttya
device in Open Firmware).
.Pp
Hold down a special key combination on the keyboard attached to
the ADB port on your system (not the serial console) when your system
boots.
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments).
.Pp
You should now see some introductory text and the Open Firmware command
prompt on your terminal:
.Pp
.Dl 0 >
.Pp
Your screen will remain black.
.Pp
Now, set your system to always stop at the Open Firmware prompt.
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? false
.Pp
Skip down to the section on
.Sx Setting up pre-Open Firmware 3 to boot NetBSD
since the next several pages are instructions for MacOS models.
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
These models are significantly trickier than the newer machines.
.Pp
All pre-Open Firmware 3 \*M systems have Open Firmware bugs. Luckily, Open 
Firmware has a small
Non-Volatile RAM variable (NVRAM) which is reserved for FORTH commands which
will be run before booting an operating system. Apple has released a freeware
.Tn MacOS
tool called System Disk, which patches
most of these bugs. We
.Em strongly
recommend that you use this tool to patch your Open Firmware,
as several systems cannot boot without these patches.  If you read
the Model Support page, you'd also know that some models are broken by
or are unsupported by System Disk.
.Pp
If you have one of the following models, then skip down to the section on
.Sx Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Harder method using MacOS)
.br
Apple Performa 4400, 5500, 6500, 54xx, 6400, and 6360, 
.br
Motorola Starmax 3000, 4000, 5000, and 5500, 
.br
APS Tech M*Power 604e/200,
.br
PowerComputing PowerBase,
.br
Umax Apus 2000, Apus 3000, C500, and C600
.Pp
For every other model, download System Disk from Apple's site:
.Lk ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/macosxserver/utilities/SystemDisk2.3.1.smi.bin
.Pp
For a brief tutorial on how to use System Disk, see:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/
.Pp
Make sure you click the
.Dq Save
button, or the patches will not be saved to NVRAM.
.(Note
NVRAM patches and Open Firmware settings will be erased if you
.Sq zap your PRAM
by holding down
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-P-R
keys during the boot chimes, or if you accidentally boot into 
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
.Note)
.Pp
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt on Older Models
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
Open Firmware has two variables,
.Sq input-device
and
.Sq output-device No Ns ,
which specify which devices to use for input and output.  
.Pp
All Open Firmware 1.0.5 and most Open Firmware 2.0.x systems will default 
to using the 
.Sq Modem
serial port for the console instead of the ADB keyboard and the monitor
attached to the on-board video.
Unless you use a MacOS-based utility to set 
these variables correctly, you 
.Em will
need to hook up a serial console temporarily to set them before you 
can use your keyboard and screen.
.Pp
Now would be a good time to look at the 
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage to determine the issues with your model.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
In particular, some models 
.Em must
use a serial console, or they will be unable to boot
.Nx
at all.  All models can be set to use a serial console, if you desire
to bypass the keyboard and screen.
.Pp
If you need to use a serial console, you can use a normal 
.Sq printer
cable (mini-DIN 8 to mini-DIN 8) and a 
.Tn MacOS
tool, such as ZTerm to
connect a 
.Tn MacOS
system to your
.Nx*M
system.

.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Recommended method using MacOS)
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
Launch the
.Tn MacOS
System Disk tool. Click on
.Dq "Power User (Open Firmware)"
then click on the
.Dq "Advanced Options"
button. Now, click on the checkbox that says
.Dq "Stop Boot at Open Firmware prompt"
and select
.Dq OK .
Click the
.Dq Save
button and reboot your system.
.Pp
If your
.Sq output-device
is
.Sq Li /chaos/control
(i.e. you have a PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 system), there is a chance that
your monitor will not sync. See
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch.html
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt on your screen:
.Pp
.(disp
Open Firmware, 1.0.5
To continue booting the MacOS type:
BYE<return>
To continue booting from the default boot device type:
BOOT<return>
 ok
0 >
.disp)
.Pp
If your screen is black, then your model does not support using the 
on-board video in
Open Firmware. You will need to connect a serial console to the 
.Sq Modem
port of your system
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.(Note
The
.Dq Stop Boot at Open Firmware prompt
setting is persistent.  It is equivalent to the Open Firmware command
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? false
.Note)
.(Note
Unfortunately, there are a few models that are better off without the System
Disk patches.  If you find that your machine doesn't boot, then try:
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv use-nvramrc? false"
.Dl 0 > Ic "reset-all"
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Harder method using MacOS)
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
If System 
Disk doesn't work because your version of
.Tn MacOS
is too old or because
System Disk says that it doesn't support your model, then you may try using
the 
.Tn MacOS
BootVars tool.
.Pp
.Lk ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/macppc/macos-utils/bootvars/bootvars.sit.hqx
.(Note
BootVars does
.Em not
apply the (possibly critical) NVRAM patches that System Disk does.
Expect some devices to not work (such as hard drives and ethernet).
.Note)
.Pp
Look up the proper
.Sq output-device
for your model on the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
If the 
.Nx*M
Model support webpage does not list an 
.Sq output-device
for your model, then your system will default to using the on-board
video.  You needn't fill in the
.Sq output-device
and
.Sq input-device
variables.
.Pp
Launch the
.Tn MacOS
BootVars tool.  Click on the
.Dq auto-boot?
checkbox, then click on the
.Dq All Variables
checkbox and type
.Ic kbd
into the
.Sq input-device
box, and the proper device name into the
.Sq output-device
box. 
Click on the
.Dq write
button, and then reboot your system.
.Pp
If your
.Sq output-device
is
.Sq Li /chaos/control
(i.e. you have a PowerMacintosh 7300 - 8600 system), there is a chance that
your monitor will not sync. See
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/SystemDisk-tutorial/of105patch.html
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt on your screen:

.disp)
.Pp
If your screen is black, then your model has defaulted to using a serial 
console.  This is fairly common on Open Firmware 1 and 2 models if you do not
use the System Disk tool to set up Open Firmware. You must hook up a serial
console (38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.(Note
The
.Dq auto-boot?
setting is persistent.  Your system will always stop at the Open Firmware

.Ss2 Getting to the Open Firmware Prompt (Without using MacOS)
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
If you don't 
have
.Tn MacOS ,
then you need to hold down a special key combination when your system boots.
Do this on the keyboard attached to
the ADB port on your system (not the serial console) when your system
boots.
.(Note
Your system will
.Em not
have the (possibly critical) NVRAM patches that System Disk applies.
Expect some devices to not work (such as hard drives and ethernet).
.Note)
.Pp
After the chime starts, but before it stops, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys (the
.Key COMMAND
key looks like a four-leaf clover or an open apple, and the
.Key OPTION
key may look like a two-way switch with four straight line segments).
.Pp
You should now see the Open Firmware command prompt on your screen:
.Pp
.(disp
Open Firmware, 1.0.5
To continue booting the MacOS type:

.Pp
If your screen is black, then your system has defaulted to using a serial

not use the System
Disk tool to set up Open Firmware. You must hook up a serial console
(38400 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no handshaking).
.Pp
Now, set your system to always stop at the Open Firmware prompt.
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv auto-boot? false
.Pp
To use your on-board video and keyboard, look up the proper
.Sq output-device
for your model on the
.Nx*M
webpage
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
Run the following commands to use your screen instead of
a serial console
(replace
.Sq Li screen
with the correct
.Sq output-device
for your model):
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv output-device screen"
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv input-device kbd"
.Dl 0 > Ic "reset-all"
.Pp
Now you should see the Open Firmware prompt on your screen.

.Ss2 Setting up pre-Open Firmware 3 to boot NetBSD
.
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, 
Open Firmware 2.4)
.Pp
Double-check your Open Firmware version:
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 > Ic "dev /openprom .properties"

.disp)
.Pp
If your system has Open Firmware prior to version 3, then you must set
some Open Firmware variables before
.Nx
can boot.  Do
.Em not
run these commands on Open Firmware 3 machines, as you may overwrite your
firmware requiring a trip to Apple for repairs.
.Pp
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv load-base 600000"
.Dl 0 > Ic "setenv real-base F00000"
.Dl 0 > Ic "reset-all"
.Pp
The last command reboots your machine so that the
.Li real-base
setting takes effect.
.Pp
If you will be netbooting your system, you can look up your MAC address.
.Pp
.(disp
.No 0 > Ic "dev enet .properties"

.disp)
.Pp
.(Note
Some early Open Firmware 1.0.5 machines had their MAC address stored
incorrectly on the motherboard (little- vs. big-endian problems).
The patches the System Disk installs will correct this.
Without the patch, the machine will still work, but its MAC address
may conflict with another ethernet device on your network.
.Note)
.Pp
.(Note
Open Firmware 1.0.5 settings and nvram patches will be erased if you boot into
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
You will need to re-enter them before booting
.Nx
again.
.Note)
.Pp
.(Note
Open Firmware 2.0.x and Open Firmware 2.4 systems will set the
.Li real-base
environment variable to its default value (which prevents
.Nx from booting) if you boot into 
.Tn MacOS No Ns .
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Setting up Open Firmware 3 to boot NetBSD

.disp)
.Pp
.(Note
Some Open Firmware 3 machines have their MAC address stored incorrectly
(little- vs. big-endian problem). If you look up your MAC address in
.Tn MacOS ,
it will be different than what Open Firmware 3 uses to contact your netboot
server. Your machine will still work, but its MAC address may conflict with
another ethernet device on your network.
.Note)
.
.Ss2 Available Boot Media
.
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
Each version of Open Firmware is capable of booting from a variety of
media.  To boot the
.Nx
kernel, Open Firmware must first open a
.Sq bootloader
which knows how to load the
.Nx
kernel.  There are two approaches, the 
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
bootloader and the
.Sq partition zero
bootloader.  In the former case, the user tells Open Firmware to
load
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
and it will load the kernel.  In the latter case, the user tells Open
Firmware to boot from a particular device, and a primary bootloader
.Pa bootxx
is loaded, which then loads the secondary bootloader
.Pa ofwboot
which then loads the kernel.
.(Note
.Pa ofwboot.elf
is obsoleted.  All users should be using
.Pa ofwboot.xcf
instead of 
.Pa ofwboot.elf
now.
.Note)
.Pp
See the FAQ for a more thorough explanation:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/faq.html#boot-support

.(Note
You must use your on-board ethernet device for netbooting.  While there
may be some PCI or Cardbus ethernet interfaces with Open Firmware ROMs, no
one has reported success netbooting using these devices

.Ss2 Creating the Bootable Media
.
.
The purpose of this section is to prepare the media from which your system
will boot the installer.  We'll describe how to put the files in the right
places on your disk(s) or netboot server and prepare it for use on your 
system.
.Pp
If you will be running your system diskless (i.e. entirely over NFS, not
using any local hard drives), then you do not need to run the installer,
you only need to extract the distribution sets on the diskless server.
.Pp
To get the distribution sets (which will be placed on your 
hard drive) onto appropriate media, see the above section entitled
.Sx Getting the NetBSD System on to Useful Media
.No Ns .
You may wish to do this at the same time you create the bootable media
(such as netbooting and placing distribution sets on the netboot server,
or booting from CD-R and placing distribution sets on the same disk)

.br
(All Open Firmware versions)
.Pp
Set up the DHCP daemon in BOOTP compatable mode, the TFTP daemon, and
the NFS daemons on your netboot server.
Tell Open Firmware to boot over ethernet, and it will send a BOOTP
request, which will tell Open Firmware what your system's IP address
is, and where its bootloader can be downloaded via TFTP.
Once Open FIrmware has downloaded the bootloader via TFTP, it will
then load the installation kernel via an NFS connection.
.Pp
Follow these instructions to configure a
.Nx
machine as your netboot server.  If you intend to use a different platform 
as your netboot server, follow the directions in the Diskless HOW-TO:
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/network/netboot
.Pp
We will use 
.Sq Li CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC
as the MAC address (ethernet hardware address) of your netboot client machine
that you wish to install
.Nx
on.  We use 
.Sq Li 192.168.1.10
as the IP address of your client, and
.Sq Li client.test.net
as the name.  The server name is
.Sq Li server.test.net ,
and the path on the server to the NFS exported directory is 
.Pa /export/client/root No .
.Pp
You should replace all of these with the names, addresses, and paths
appropriate to your environment.
.Pp
Now, set up your 
.Ic dhcpd
server.  Make sure the following lines are in
.Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf :
.(disp
allow bootp;	# Allow bootp requests, thus the dhcp server
		# will act as a bootp server.

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
		# Which network interface the server will
		# listen on.  The zeros indicate which
		# range of addresses are allowed to connect.
}

group {                                
		# Set of parameters common to all clients
		# in this "group".
		#
	option broadcast-address	192.168.1.255;

		# An individual client.
		#
	host client.test.net {
		hardware ethernet	CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC;
		fixed-address		192.168.1.10;

		# Name of the host (if the fixed address
		# doesn't resolve to a simple name).
		#
		option host-name	"client";

		# Name of the bootloader or kernel
		# to download via tftp.
		#
		filename		"ofwboot.xcf";

		# The path on the NFS server.
		#
		option	root-path	"/export/client/root";
	}
}
.disp)
.Pp
You will need to make sure that the
.Pa dhcpd.leases
file exists.
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "touch /var/db/dhcpd.leases"
.Pp
You will need to 
.Ic kill
the
.Ic dhcpd
and restart it to get it to re-read its configuration file.
If the server is running
.Nx 1.5 ,
you can achieve this with:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/etc/rc.d/dhcpd restart"
.Pp
Now, place a copy of the
.Pa installation/ofwboot.xcf
bootloader in 
.Pa /tftpboot
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cp ofwboot.xcf /tftpboot"
.Pp
Now, you should edit
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf
and make sure that the line starting with 
.Li tftp
is uncommented.  You will need to
.Ic kill -HUP
the
.Ic inetd
process to enable tftp if this line was previously commented out.  The next
step is to set up NFS exports.  Create the directory you are exporting for
the netboot client:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mkdir -p /export/client/root"
.Pp
Put the following line in
.Pa /etc/exports
to enable NFS sharing:
.Pp
.Dl "/export/client/root -maproot=root client.test.net"
.Pp
If your server is currently running NFS services, you only need to 
.Ic "kill -HUP"
the
.Ic mountd
process.  Otherwise, you need to run:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/usr/sbin/mountd"
.Dl # Ic "/usr/sbin/nfsd -tun 4"
.Pp
Now, you need to place the files your netboot client will need.
As noted above in the section
.Pa Preparing your System for NetBSD Installation
you have several options when choosing a location to store the
distribution
filesets. However, the easiest way is to put the distribution
files into the exported directory for your client on the server.
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "mv *.tgz /export/client/root"
.Pp
Your client will need a kernel to boot (use 
.Pa installation/netbsd.ram.gz ) .
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "gunzip netbsd.ram.gz"
.Dl # Ic "mv netbsd.ram /export/client/root/netbsd"
