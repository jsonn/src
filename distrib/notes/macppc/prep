.Ss2 Prepare yourself
.
Take a deep breath.
.Pp
Good.
Now, make sure you are reading the PDF (if available), PostScript,
or HTML version of this document, as the
.Pa \&.txt No and Pa \&.more
versions lack important formatting information that will prevent you from
following the twisted path you must follow.
OK, good.
Now, print out this document.
.Pp
While it's printing, get some coffee, relax a bit, and mentally prepare
yourself for something that promises to be confusing, frustrating, and
annoying.
If you assume the worst, you'll be pleasantly surprised when
everything works easier than you expected.
Also, forget everything you've been told about installing
.Nx*M .
That's right, flush your knowledge cache -- some of it is almost
certainly dirty.
.Pp
Some of this document assumes familiarity with
.Tn MacOS ,
e.g. how to download BinHex files and extract things with StuffIt Expander.
If you've never heard of those terms before, it is possible to
install
.Nx*M
without booting or knowing how to use
.Tn MacOS ,
but depending on your model it may be almost as painful as learning a
little
.Tn MacOS .
See the FAQ for more help:
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/ports/macppc/faq.html#macos-newbie
.Pp
It's done printing?  Fine, time to get started.
.Pp
The recommended installation procedure is as follows:
.(enum
Go to the
.Nx*M
model support page and look up your model information and issues (I can't
stress this enough times).
.Lk http://www.NetBSD.org/ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
.It
Spend about 15 minutes and read through this document from this point onward.
There will be many pages of instructions that apply to Open Firmware versions
that you do not have.  Throw them out.  Do not read them \(em at best you 
will be confused, at worst you may damage your system requiring repairs.
.Pp
.It
Now create your bootable media and media for the distribution sets.
.Pp
.It
Prepare your machine, depending on the instructions for your model
(for example: partition your drive, download and run System Disk, or hook
up a serial console).
.Pp
.It
Boot into Open Firmware, and verify that it has the version of Open
Firmware you think it does.
Also make sure that the other variables are set correctly.
.Pp
.It
Figure out the correct boot command, and boot your machine from the
bootable media you just created.
If you're having trouble, be sure to read the section on
.Sx "Common Problems and Error Messages"
.Pp
.It
Celebrate!
The worst is over, but you've still got some work to do.
Take a break, maybe more coffee, maybe a quick walk around the block,
whatever turns your fancy.
.Pp
.It
Now use the installer to install the distribution sets onto your system
and do some initial configurations.
.Pp
.It
Figure out how to boot from the installed partition.
Boot into
.Nx
for the first time.
.Pp
.It
You may then boot into Open Firmware and set it to always boot your
favorite operating system.
.Pp
.It
Configure to your preferences, install your favorite packages, and have
fun with your new
.Nx*M
machine!

.Pp
.(Note
You really actually truly do need to follow the procedure listed in this
document in the order that we describe.
These systems are rather tricky to boot for the novice and expert alike.
Once you cross off the sections that don't apply to you,
it will make more sense.
.Note)
.(Note
If the instructions in a subsection below do not apply to
.Em all
versions of Open Firmware, there will be a line listing which versions of
Open Firmware they apply to, such as:
.br
(Open Firmware 1.0.5, Open Firmware 1.1.22, Open Firmware 2.0.x, Open
Firmware 2.4, Open Firmware 3)
.Note)
If you do not have an Open Firmware 3 system, skip down to 
.Sx "Preparing your Open Firmware 1.x or 2.x System for NetBSD"
