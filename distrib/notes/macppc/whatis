This is the fifth major release of
.Nx
for the \*M platform, including the Apple eMac, iBook, iMac, 
PowerMacintosh, PowerBook, and Xserve models, as well as clones.
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
