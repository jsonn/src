When installing NetBSD for your
.Nx \*V
system, you have to decide where you want your root partition and
how you'll be downloading your kernel.
Since the
.Tn IBM
ROM rather limits your boot options, you won't be able to have the
machine boot independently.
Once you load the kernel, however, you may have the root file system on a
local disk or you can configure a diskless setup.
.Pp
In either case, you'll need to set up to boot the kernel over the network
or over a serial line.
