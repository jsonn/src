.Nx*M
\*V runs on most Sun3 machines, including:
.Bl -column -offset indent 3/260 3/280 3/160
.It 3/50  Ta 3/60  Ta 3/110
.It 3/75  Ta 3/150 Ta 3/160
.It 3/260 Ta 3/280 Ta 3/E
.It 3/80  Ta 3/470

Note that
.Nx*M
includes support for
.Sq "Sun3X"
machines, which used to be supported with a separate
.Nx Ns /sun3x
distribution.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4 MB of RAM and about 100 MB of disk
space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space.
To run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
Good performance requires 8 MB of RAM, or 16 MB when running the
X Window System.
A good rule of thumb is to have a swap partition twice the size of the
amount of RAM in your machine.
You will probably want to compile your own kernel, as
.Li GENERIC
is large and bulky to accommodate all people.
.Pp
Note that the \*M installation procedure uses a
.Em miniroot
image
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.
The swap partition must be at least as large as the miniroot image (10 MB).
