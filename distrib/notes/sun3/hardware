.Nx*M
\*V runs on most Sun3 machines, including:
.Bl -column -offset indent 3/260 3/280 3/160
.It 3/50  Ta 3/60  Ta 3/110
.It 3/75  Ta 3/150 Ta 3/160
.It 3/260 Ta 3/280 Ta 3/E
.It 3/80  Ta 3/470

Note that
.Nx*M
now includes support for
.Sq "Sun3X"
machines, which used to be supported with a separate
.Nx Ns /sun3x
distribution.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4 MB of RAM and about 80 MB of disk
space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space
(approx. 100 MB additional space is necessary for full sources).
To run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  Good
performance requires 8 MB of RAM, or 16 MB when running the
X Window System.
.Pp
Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bl -column -offset indent Partition Suggested 100xMBxx Needed 100xMB
.It Partition Ta Suggested Ta +\ X     Ta Needed  Ta +\ X
.It /\ (root) Ta "20 MB"   Ta "20 MB"  Ta "15 MB" Ta "15 MB"
.It /usr      Ta "175 MB"  Ta "205 MB" Ta "75 MB" Ta "105 MB"
.It /var      Ta "20 MB"   Ta "20 MB"  Ta "5 MB"  Ta "5 MB"
.It swap      Ta Em 2*RAM \&...

.(item -offset indent
Anything else is up to you!
.item)
.Pp
As you may note, the recommended size of
.Pa /usr
is 100 MB greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel.
.Li ( GENERIC
is large and bulky to accommodate all people).
.Pp
Note that the \*M installation procedure uses a
.Em miniroot
image
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.  The swap partition
must be at least as large as the miniroot image (10 MB).
