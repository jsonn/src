NetBSD/sun3 1.1 runs on most Sun3 machines, including:
		3/50, 3/60, 3/110
		3/75, 3/150, 3/160
		3/260, 3/280

NetBSD/sun3 1.1 does not run on the Sun3/80 (sun3x class)
because the sun3x MMU and other devices are very different.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~80MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space (approx.
100MB additional space is necessary for full sources).  To run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  Good performance
requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB when running the X Window System.

The following Sun3 hardware is supported:

	Serial ports (RS232):
		built-in ttya, ttyb

	Video adapters:
		bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour

	Network interfaces:
		On-board Lance Ethernet (le)
		On-board or VME Intel Ethernet (ie)

	SCSI:  (Most SCSI disks, tapes, CD-ROMs, etc.)
		On-board "si" (SCSI-3)  [Note 1]
		VME "si" (SCSI-3) board [Note 1]

	SMD Disks:  (the big, heavy ones 8^)
		Xylogics 450/451  [Note 2]
		Xylogics 753/7053 [Note 2]

	Input devices:
		Sun keyboard and mouse

	Miscellaneous:
		Battery-backed real-time clock.

Note 1:
    The "si" driver now supports DMA and disconnect/reselect
    but due to the imaturity of the DMA code, those features
    are disabled by default.  To enable DMA (and get faster
    SCSI performance) patch the variable si_options in the
    file /usr/src/sys/arch/sun3/dev/ncr_si.c as indicated.

Note 2:
    SMD disk support is almost ready, but could not be tested
    in time for this release.  Drivers are provided for the
    Xylogics 450/451 and Xylogics 753/7053 VME boards only as
    source code.  They compile but have never touched a disk.

If it's not on this list, there is no support for it in this release.
