NetBSD/sun3 1.2 runs on most Sun3 machines, including:
		3/50, 3/60, 3/110
		3/75, 3/150, 3/160
		3/260, 3/280

NetBSD/sun3 1.2 does not run on the Sun3/80 (sun3x class)
because the sun3x MMU and other devices are very different.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~80MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space (approx.
100MB additional space is necessary for full sources).  To run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  Good performance
requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB when running the X Window System.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise		needed
	root (/)	15M		10M
	user (/usr)	80M		45M
	swap		(2 or 3 * RAM)	 8M
	Anything else is up to you!

Note that the sun3 installation procedure uses a `miniroot' image
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.  The swap partition
must be large enough to hold this miniroot image.

The following Sun3 hardware is supported:

	Serial ports (RS232):
		built-in ttya, ttyb

	Video adapters:
		bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour

	Network interfaces:
		On-board Lance Ethernet (le)
		On-board or VME Intel Ethernet (ie)

	SCSI:  (Most SCSI disks, tapes, CD-ROMs, etc.)
		On-board "si" (SCSI-3)  [Note 1]
		VME "si" (SCSI-3) board [Note 1]

	SMD Disks:  (the big, heavy ones 8^)
		Xylogics 450/451  [Note 2]
		Xylogics 753/7053 [Note 2]

	Input devices:
		Sun keyboard and mouse

	Miscellaneous:
		Battery-backed real-time clock.

Note 1:
    The "si" driver now supports DMA and disconnect/reselect.
    DMA is enabled by default, but not disconnect/reselect.

Note 2:
    The SMD disk drivers ("xd" and "xy") are working but
    have not had much testing.  (Probably need work.)

If it's not on this list, there is no support for it in this release.
