The sun3-specific portion of the NetBSD 1.2.1 release is found in the
"sun3" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-1.2.1/sun3/
			INSTALL.txt	Installation notes; this file.

			install/	Boot programs, a GENERIC kernel,
					a stand-alone RAMDISK kernel,
					and a miniroot filesystem image.
					see below.

			binary/		sun3 binary distribution sets;
					see below.

			security/	sun3 security distribution;
					see below.

.../sun3/install/

The NetBSD/sun3 install distribution contains files that can be
used to install NetBSD onto a completely "bare" sun3.  The files
in the "sun3/install" directory are described below:

	MakeBootTape	A script for creating a boot tape using
			the other files in this directory.

	miniroot.gz	A gzipped copy of the miniroot filesystem.
			This image is to be un-gzipped and copied
			into the swap area of a disk.

	netbsd-rd.gz	A gzipped copy of the "RAMDISK kernel"
			for installing the miniroot filesystem.

	netbsd-gen.gz	A gzipped GENERIC kernel (for upgrade)

	netboot		A copy of the network boot program.
			This is useful if you are installing
			a diskless NetBSD/sun3 system.

	tapeboot	A copy of the tape boot program, used
			as the first segment of a boot tape.

These files can be used to make a boot tape suitable for installing
NetBSD/sun3.  These files can also be used to configure an NFS server
to support installation "over the network".  See the section "Getting
the NetBSD System onto Useful Media" for instructions on either method.

.../sun3/binary/

The NetBSD/sun3 binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD 1.2.1 release for the sun3.  There are seven binary
distribution sets, and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in the "sun3/binary" subdirectory of
the NetBSD 1.2.1 distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base121	The NetBSD/sun3 1.2.1 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 7.6M gzipped, 21.5M uncompressed ]

	comp121	The NetBSD/sun3 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C and C++.  This set includes the system
		include files (/usr/include), the linker, the compiler
		tool chain, and the various system libraries (except
		the shared libraries, which are included as part of the
		base set).  This set also includes the manual pages for
		all of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 5.4M gzipped, 17.2M uncompressed ]

	etc121	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 68K gzipped, 350K uncompressed ]

	games121 This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.9M gzipped, 7.0M uncompressed ]

	man121	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 0.9K gzipped, 3.5M uncompressed ]

	misc121	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.9M gzipped, 6.5M uncompressed ]

	text121	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 0.8M gzipped, 2.9M uncompressed ]

.../sun3/security/

The sun3 security distribution set is named "secr121" and can be found
in the "sun3/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD 1.2.1 distribution
tree.  It contains executables which are built in the "src/domestic" portion
if the NetBSD source tree.  It can only be found on those sites which carry
the complete NetBSD distribution and that can legally obtain it.  (Remember,
because of United States law, this distribution set may not be exported to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
[ 128K gzipped, 275K uncompressed ]

The sun3 binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files.
Each sun3 binary distribution set also has its own "CKSUMS" file, just
as the source distribution sets do.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the command:

	tar --unlink -zxvpf set.tar.gz

from /.   Note that the "--unlink" flags is very important!

For best results, it is recommended that you follow the installation
and/or upgrade procedures documented in this file.
