NetBSD 1.1 is the first "full" release of NetBSD for the sun3,
including a full set of binaries.  This binary distribution is
referred to elsewhere in this document by the name NetBSD/sun3.
This release offers improved stability and many new features.

New features added since the 1.0 release include:
* Native boot programs for disk, network, and tape
* Automated installation tools (using a "miniroot")
* New SCSI driver supporting DMA, interrupts, and
  disconnect/reselect with SCSI-2 devices (optional)
* Frame buffer drivers for bwtwo, cgtwo, and cgthree,
  all compatible with SunOS and the X Window System
* Support for the Virtually Addressed Cache (VAC) on
  Sun3/260 models (and vastly improved performance)
* SMD disk drivers -- almost (still need testing)

Old features (from 1.0 and earier) worth mentioning:
* SunOS 4.1 compatibility (runs most Sun3 applications)
* Supports most SCSI devices (CD-ROM, etc)
* Diskless boot capability
* Built-in kernel debugger
