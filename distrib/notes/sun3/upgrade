It is possible to easily upgrade your existing NetBSD/sun3 system
using the upgrade program in the miniroot.  If you wish to upgrade
your system by this method, simply select the `upgrade' option once
the miniroot has booted.  The upgrade program with then guide you
through the procedure.  The upgrade program will:

	* Enable the network based on your system's current
	  network configuration.

	* Mount your existing filesystems.

	* Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.

	* Make new device nodes in your root filesystem.

	* Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.
	  NOTE: the existing kernel WILL NOT be backed up; doing
	  so would be pointless, since older kernels may not be
	  capable of running NetBSD _VER executables.

	* Install a new boot block.

	* Check your filesystems for integrity.

While using the miniroot's upgrade program is the preferred method
of upgrading your system, it is possible to upgrade your system
manually.  To do this, follow the following procedure:

	* Place _at least_ the `base' binary set in a filesystem
	  accessible to the target machine.  A local filesystem
	  is preferred, since the NFS subsystem in the NetBSD _VER
	  kernel may be incompatible with your old binaries.

	* Back up your pre-existing kernel and copy the _VER
	  kernel into your root partition.

	* Reboot with the _VER kernel into single-user mode.
	  (Otherwise you can not install the boot block.)

	* Check all filesystems:

		/sbin/fsck -pf

	* Mount all local filesystems:

		/sbin/mount -a -t nonfs

	* If you keep /usr or /usr/share on an NFS server, you
	  will want to mount those filesystems as well.  To do
	  this, you will need to enable the network:

		sh /etc/netstart

	* Run the update(8) daemon, to ensure that new programs
	  are actually stored on disk.

		update

	* Make sure you are in the root filesystem and extract
	  the `base' binary set:

		cd /
		tar --unlink -zxvpf /path/to/base.tar.gz

	  NOTE: the `--unlink' option is _very_ important!

	* Install a new boot block:
	  (assuming root is on /dev/rsd0a)

		cd /usr/mdec
		cp -p ./ufsboot /mnt/ufsboot
		sync ; sleep 1 ; sync
		./installboot -v /ufsboot bootxx /dev/rsd0a

	* Sync the filesystems:

		sync

	* At this point you may extract any other binary sets
	  you may have placed on local filesystems, or you may
	  wish to extract additional sets at a later time.
	  To extract these sets, use the following commands:

		cd /
		tar --unlink -zxvpf <path to set>

NOTE: you SHOULD NOT extract the `etc' set if upgrading.  Instead, you
should extract that set into another area and carefully merge the changes
by hand.
