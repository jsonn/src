Begin by creating an area in the server's filesystem for the
NetBSD/next68k image.  This area must be exported read-write to the NeXT
workstation.  In the simplest form of installation, the entire image is
exported as a single partition, mounted on / by the target.  This
corresponds to a local disk install with just one partition.  It is also
possible to export /usr or other partitions seperately.  /usr can be
exported read-only, and multiple machines can all share the same /usr
partition.
.Pp
To extract the sets into the exported area:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /path/to/exported/filesystem
pax -zrvpe -f /path/to/base.tgz
.Ed
and repeat for any other sets you wish to install.  You'll almost
certainly need the etc.tgz set.
.Pp
Edit the files in the etc directory to reflect reality.  rc.conf and
fstab will certainly need to be edited.
.Pp
cd into the dev directory in the exported area and run
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sh ./MAKEDEV all
.Ed
to create the various device nodes.
.Pp
Create an empty swap file, and place it somewhere where it can also
be exported to the target.
.Pp
Edit the server's /etc/exports file to export the root and swap
partitions to the target.  Both must be read-write, and allow full root
privileges.
.Pp
You'll also need to set up a tftp server and bootp server to enable
netbooting.  These services don't have to run on the same machine that
exports the target image, but it is often convenient to do so.  More
information on configuring these services can be found at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/network/netboot/
Note that your bootptab requires the tag "vm=auto" for bootpd
to work with the NeXT.
