mirror sites and download CD-R image from the
.Pa pub/NetBSD/iso
directory.

.Pp
Get and install cdrecord.
This is available in the packages collection under pkgsrc/sysutils/cdrecord.

collection should get it from the official website:

You will need to substitute the correct name of the disk image file,
speed for your CD writer, and the
correct device for your system (for i386 it would be
