.Pp
.Nx*M
has switched its executable format from the old a.out format
to ELF, the now more commonly used and supported format.
Your old binaries will continue to work just fine.
The installation procedure will try to take the necessary steps
to accomplish this.
.Pp
The most important step is to move the old a.out shared libraries in
.Pa /usr/lib
and
.Pa /usr/X11R6/lib
(if X was installed) to
.Pa /emul/aout ,
where they will be automatically found if an older a.out binary
is executed.
.Ic sysinst
will use an existing
.Pa /emul
and / or
.Pa /emul/aout
directory if available, and will create it (as a symbolic link to
.Pa /usr/aout )
if necessary.
.Pp
If you already had a
.Pa /emul
directory, or a symbolic link by that name,
.Ic sysinst
should rename it and tell you about it.
