Installation of
.Nx*M
is now easier than ever!
For the latest news, problem reports, and discussion, join
the port-\*M maillist by mailing a line saying
.Pp
.Dl subscribe port-\*M
.Pp
to
.Mt majordomo@netsbd.org .
Also, see
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org
for more information.
.Pp
If you encounter any problems, please report them via the mailing list or the
.Xr send-pr 1
program so that they can be fixed for the next release.
.Pp
To install or upgrade
.Nx ,
you need to first boot the installation
program and then interact with the screen-menu program
.Ic sysinst .
The installation program actually consists of the
.Nx
kernel plus
an in-memory file system of utility programs.
.Pp
The usual procedure is to write the installation system to the
install media, as described earlier.
.Pp
Booting from install media
.Pp
The built-in console monitor understands a bunch of commands, dependent
of which VAX you have.
To just boot from a device, type
.Sq Ic B
at the
.Li \*>\*>\*>
prompt.
Device naming in the console monitor differs a lot from the
.Ux
counterparts.
A device looks like
.Li "ddcu" , where
.Sq Li dd
is the device
type,
.Sq Li c
is the controller number and
.Sq Li u
is the device unit.
Many console monitors also support the
.Ic SHOW DEV
command, which shows available units to boot from.
.Pp
A summary of the most common boot devices and their name:
.(tag B\ DUA0
.It Ic "B DUA0"
first MSCP controller, unit 0.
.It Ic "B MUA0"
first TMSCP tape controller, unit 0.
.It Ic "B DKB0"
second SCSI bus, unit 0.
.It Ic "B XQA0"
first Q22 bus Ethernet controller.
.It Ic "B ESA0"
first LANCE Ethernet controller on VAXstations.
.It Ic "B EZA0"
first SGEC Ethernet controller on VAXstations.
.tag)
Other devices may be appropriate for your configuration.
.Pp
Then just proceed with the program
.Ic sysinst .
The install descriptions for sysinst that follows can be easily adopted to VAX.
.Pp
.\" Sad that the sysinst install instructions are so i386-specific.
