VAX machines usually need little or no preparation before installing
NetBSD, other than the usual, well advised precaution of BACKING UP
ALL DATA on any attached storage devices.

You will need to know the CSR address of your disk controller(s) if
they are on a Qbus/Unibus. The disk controllers must then be at
either 772150 (DUA) or 760334 (DUB). These two addresses are the
only recognized by the kernel and boot programs.
.Pp
Also; if you are installing on a VAXstation, note that the only supported
built-in console is the monochrome graphics on some VS3100's. If you
have another graphic card or machine you
.Em must
have a serial console.
