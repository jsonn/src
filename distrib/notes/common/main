.Ss "Quick install notes for the impatient"
.Pp
This section contains some brief notes describing what you need to
install
.Nx \*V
on a machine of the \*M architecture.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Fetch the
.if \n[i386] \{\
appropriate pair of boot floppy images from the
.Pa installation/floppy/
directory.
Most people will need the
.Pa boot1.fs
and
.Pa boot2.fs
images, or possibly (but not necessarily)
.Pa bootlap1.fs
and
.Pa bootlap2.fs
if installing on a laptop.
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
files necessary to boot your system.
The files depend on what model you
are using and how you plan to boot your machine.
For systems with built-in floppy drives, fetch the bootloader
.Pa installation/ofwboot.xcf
and the installation kernel
.Pa binary/kernel/netbsd.INSTALL.gz .
For systems without floppy drives, fetch the bootloader
.Pa installation/ofwboot.xcf
and the installation kernel
.Pa binary/kernel/netbsd.GENERIC_MD.gz .
Alternatively, you can fetch the CD image,
.Pa macppc_bootable.iso
or the boot floppy image
.Pa installation/floppy/boot.fs
which include the bootloader and installation kernel.
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
CD image,
.Pa sparc_bootable.iso
or the floppy disk images,
.Pa install/floppy/disk1.gz No and Pa install/floppy/disk2 .
You need either the pair of floppies or the CD to boot your system.
.\}
.if \n[macppc]:\n[sparc] \{\
Alternatively, you may netboot the installation kernel, which requires
several local netboot services.
The details are not covered here, as setting up a netboot server is hardly
.Dq quick .
.\}
.It
The actual binary distribution is in the
.Pa binary/sets/
directory.
When you boot the install
.if \n[i386] floppies,
.if \n[macppc] kernel from floppy, hard drive, or CD-ROM,
.if \n[sparc] floppies or CD-ROM,
the installation program
can fetch these files for you (using e.g. ftp),
if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
your machine.
.Pp
You will at a minimum need
.ie \n[i386] \{\
one of the kernel sets, typically
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz ,
as well as
.\}
.el \{\
the following sets:
.Pa kern-GENERIC.tgz ,
.\}
.Pa base.tgz
and
.Pa etc.tgz .
In a typical workstation installation you will probably want
all the installation sets.
.if \n[i386] \{
.It
Write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies.
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy,
the
.Ic rawrite.exe
MS-DOS program
or the
.Ic Rawrite32.exe
Windows32 program (inside
.Pa rawrite32.zip )
in the
.Pa utilities/
directory may be of help.
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{
.It
If your mac has a floppy drive, copy
.Pa ofwboot.xcf No and Pa netbsd.INSTALL.gz
to an MS-DOS formatted floppy disk and rename
.Pa netbsd.INSTALL.gz No to Pa netbsd.gz .
Otherwise, drag
.Pa ofwboot.xcf No and Pa netbsd.GENERIC_MD.gz
to your hard drive icon (the top level of the drive, not the desktop).
If you are making a CD, burn it now.
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{
.It
Make sure your sparc's CD-ROM drive is bootable.
Burn the CD.
Otherwise, write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies
(after uncompressing disk1.gz).
.\}
.Pp
The disk(s) you just prepared will be used to boot the installation
kernel, which contains all the tools required to install
.Nx .
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
Determine your machine's model, quirks, and Open Firmware version from the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
At present,
.Nx*M
cannot exist on the same hard drive as
.Tn Mac OS
unless you partition your disk using a
.Tn Mac OS
partitioning utility.
Open Firmware versions prior to 3 cannot boot into
.Nx
on a drive partitioned this way \(em you must use the entire disk,
partitioned with the installation tools.
Open Firmware version 3 cannot boot into
.Nx
on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must use a
.Tn Mac OS
partitioning utility and the
.Dq Me "Re-install sets or install additional sets"
option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).
If you are unsure, you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Partitioning your hard drive for NetBSD
.It
For systems with Open Firmware versions prior to 3, you may need to use
Apple's System Disk utility to enter Open Firmware and use your screen and
keyboard.
To enter Open Firmware, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys after the boot chime starts, but before it ends.
Entering Open Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating
part of installation \(em you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.Pp
You should have the Open Firmware
.Dq Pa "0 \*>"
prompt on your screen before attempting to boot
.Nx*M .
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{\
.It
At the Open Firmware prompt, type the command to boot.
To boot from a floppy, the command is
.Dq Ic "boot fd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.gz" .
For the install kernel and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is
.Dq Ic "boot hd:\e,ofwboot.xcf netbsd.GENERIC_MD.gz" .
.Pp
For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"
(for Open Firmware 3) or
.Dq Ic "boot scsi-int/sd@3:0 NETBSD.MACPPC"
(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for
.Ic OFWBOOT.XCF No and Ic NETBSD.MACPPC
depending on how your version of Open Firmware interprets the ISO
file system.
You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , scsi-ext/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.
You should also use the Open Firmware
.Ic dir
command to confirm that the
.Nx*M
kernel is called
.Pa NETBSD.MACPPC .
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{\
.It
You will need to get to the OpenBoot PROM
.Dq Ic "ok"
prompt.
After your system first powers on, and displays some initial information,
press the
.Key STOP-A
keys.
At the
.Dq Ic "ok"
prompt, type the command to boot your system into
.Nx .
The command to boot from CD is one of the following commands (depending on
your model):
.Dq Ic b sd(,30,) ,
.Dq Ic boot sd(,30,) ,
or
.Dq Ic boot cdrom .
.Pp
The command to boot from floppy is either
.Dq Ic boot fd(,,1)
or
.Dq Ic boot floppy .
The installer will prompt you to insert the second floppy when it is ready
for it.

.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional
.Tn Open Source
.Ul
operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on fifty three different system architectures (ports),
featuring seventeen machine architectures
across eleven distinct CPU families,
and is being ported to more.
The
.Nx \*V
release contains complete binary releases for thirty eight different
system architectures.
(The fifteen remaining are not fully supported at this time
and are thus not part of the binary distribution.
For information on them, please see the
.Nx
web site at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/ . )
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that
.Nx
wouldn't exist.
.Ss Upgrade path to NetBSD 1.6
If you are not installing your system ``from scratch'' but instead
are going to upgrade an existing system already running
.Nx
you need to know which versions you can upgrade with
.Nx 1.6 .
.Pp
.Nx 1.6
is an upgrade of
.Nx 1.5.3
and earlier major and patch releases of
.Nx .
.Pp
The intermediate development versions of code available on the main trunk
in our CVS repository (also known as ``NetBSD-current'') from
.Em after
the point where the release cycle for 1.6 was started are designated
by version identifiers such as 1.6A, 1.6B, etc.
These identifiers do not designate releases, but indicate major changes
in internal kernel APIs.
Note that the kernel from
.Nx
1.6 can
.Em not
be used to upgrade a system running one of those intermediate development
versions.
Trying to use the
.Nx
1.6 kernel on such a system
.Em will
probably result in problems.
.Pp
Please also note that it is not possible to do a direct ``version''
comparison between any of the intermediate development versions mentioned
above and 1.6 to determine if a given feature is present or absent
in 1.6.
The development of 1.6 and the subsequent ``point'' releases
is done on a separate branch in the CVS repository.
The branch was created when the release cycle for 1.6 was started,
and during the release cycle of 1.6 and its patch releases selected
fixes and enhancements have been imported from the main development
trunk.
.ig
For example, there may be features in 1.6.1 which were not in 1.6B,
and vice versa.
..
.if \n[FOR_RELEASE] \{\
.Ss Changes Between The NetBSD 1.5 and 1.6 Releases
.Pp
The
.Nx 1.6
release
provides numerous significant functional enhancements, including
support for many new devices, integration of hundreds of bug fixes,
new and updated kernel subsystems, and many user-land enhancements.
The result of these improvements is a stable operating system fit for
production use that rivals most commercially available systems.

.
The
.Nx
Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization.
Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the free exchange
of computer software, namely the
.Nx
Operating
System.
The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the
.Nx
Project.
.Pp
The
.Nx
Foundation will help improve the quality of
.Nx
by:
.(bullet
providing better organization to keep track of development
efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in
related fields.
.It
providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
services and to own the resources necessary to run the
.Nx
Project.
.It
providing a better position from which to undertake
promotional activities.
.It
periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
interested people to discuss ongoing work.
.bullet)
.Pp
We intend to begin narrowing the time delay between releases.
Our ambition is to provide a full release every six to eight months.
.Pp
We hope to support even
.Em more
hardware in the future, and we have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
.Nx .
.Pp
We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.
.Pp
We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
submit them, providing that they are well thought-out and increase the
usability of the system.
.Pp
Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of
.Nx
users, because it is for
and because of them that
.Nx
exists.

export regulations of the United States, e.g.
code under
.Pa src/crypto
and
.Pa src/sys/crypto .
It is your responsibility
to determine whether or not it is legal for you to export these portions
and to act accordingly.
.Pp
The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
.Pa source
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
They contain the complete sources to the system.
The source distribution sets are as follows:
.(tag sharesrc
.It Sy gnusrc
This set contains the
.Dq gnu
sources, including the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution sets.
.showsize 55 247
.It Sy pkgsrc
This set contains the
.Dq pkgsrc
sources, which contain the infrastructure to build third-party packages.
.showsize 12 94
.It Sy sharesrc
This set contains the
.Dq share
sources, which include the sources for the man pages not associated
with any particular program; the sources for the typesettable document
set; the dictionaries; and more.
.showsize 4 16
.It Sy src
This set contains all of the base
.Nx \*V
sources which are not in
.Sy gnusrc ,
.Sy sharesrc ,
or
.Sy syssrc .
.showsize 27 136
.It Sy syssrc
This set contains the sources to the
.Nx \*V
kernel for all architectures;
.Xr config 8 ;
and
.Xr dbsym 8 .
.showsize 22 114
.It Sy xsrc
This set contains the sources to the X Window System.
.showsize 78 394
.tag)
.Pp
All the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
.Pp
The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files.
Except for the
.Sy pkgsrc 
set, which is traditionally unpacked into
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc ,
all sets may be unpacked into
.Pa /usr/src
with the command:
.Dl # Ic "( cd / ; tar -zxpf - ) \*< set_name.tgz"
.Pp
The
.Pa sets/Split/
subdirectory contains split
versions of the source sets for those users who need to load the
source sets from floppy or otherwise need a split distribution.
The split sets are named
.Pa "set_name." Ns Ar xx
where
.Pa set_name
is the distribution set name, and
.Ar xx
is the sequence number of the file,
starting with
.Dq aa
for the first file in the distribution set, then
.Dq ab
for the next, and so on.
All of these files except the last one of each set should be exactly
240,640 bytes long.
(The last file is just long enough to contain the remainder of the data
for that distribution set.)
.Pp
The split distributions may be reassembled and extracted with
.Ic cat
as follows:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cat set_name.?? | ( cd / ; tar -zxpf - )"
.Pp
In each of the source distribution set directories, there are
files which contain the checksums of the files in the directory:
.(tag SYSVSUM -offset indent
.It Li BSDSUM
Historic
.Bx
checksums for the various files
in that directory, in the format produced by the command:
.br
.Ic cksum -o 1 Ar file .
.It Li CKSUM
.Tn POSIX
checksums for the various files in that
directory, in the format produced by the command:
.br
.Ic cksum Ar file .
.It Li MD5
.Tn MD5
digests for the various files in that
directory, in the format produced by the command:
.br
.Ic cksum Fl m Ar file .
.It Li SYSVSUM
Historic AT\*&T System V
.Ux
checksums for the various files in that directory, in the format produced by
the command:
.br
.Ic cksum -o 2 Ar file .
.tag)
.Pp
The MD5 digest is the safest checksum, followed by the POSIX
checksum.
The other two checksums are provided only to ensure
that the widest possible range of system can check the integrity
of the release files.

.Pp
.
Users upgrading from previous versions of
.Nx
may wish to bear the
following problems and compatibility issues in mind when upgrading to
.Nx \*V .
.
.Ss2 Issues affecting an upgrade from NetBSD 1.5
These issues can generally be resolved by extracting the
.Sy etc
set into a temporary directory
(such as
.Pa /tmp/upgrade )
and running:
.(disp
cd /tmp/upgrade
\&./etc/postinstall -s `pwd` check
\&./etc/postinstall -s `pwd` fix
.disp)
.(bullet
Various files in
.Pa /etc
need upgrading.
These include:
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
.Pa /etc/defaults/*
.It
.Pa /etc/mtree/*
.It
.Pa /etc/daily
.It
.Pa /etc/weekly
.It
.Pa /etc/monthly
.It
.Pa /etc/security
.It
.Pa /etc/rc.subr
.It
.Pa /etc/rc
.It
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
.It
.Pa /etc/rc.d/*
.bullet)
.Pp
The following files are now obsolete:
.Pa /etc/rc.d/NETWORK
and
.Pa /etc/rc.d/gated .
.
.It
The following
.Xr rc.conf 5
entries are now obsolete:
.Li amd_master ,
.Li ip6forwarding ,
.Li defcorename ,
and
.Li nfsiod_flags .
.Li critical_filesystems_beforenet
has been replaced by
.Li critical_filesystems_local .
.Li critical_filesystems
has been replaced by
.Li critical_filesystems_remote .
.
.It
The users and groups
.Sq named ,
.Sq ntpd ,
and
.Sq sshd
need to be created.
.
.It
The configuration files for
.Xr ssh 1
and
.Xr sshd 8
were moved from
.Pa /etc
to
.Pa /etc/ssh ,
including 
.Pa ssh_known_hosts*
files and the
host key files
.Pa ssh_host*_key* .
.Pa /etc/ssh.conf
was renamed to
.Pa /etc/ssh/ssh_config ,
and
.Pa /etc/sshd.conf
was renamed to
.Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config .
.
.It
The
.Ic mux
entries in
.Xr wscons.conf 5
are now obsolete.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 Issues affecting an upgrade from NetBSD 1.4 or prior
.(bullet
.Pa /etc/rc
modified to use
.Pa /etc/rc.d/*
.Pp
Prior to
.Nx 1.5 ,
.Pa /etc/rc
was a traditional
.Bx
style monolithic file; each discrete program or substem from
.Pa /etc/rc
and
.Pa /etc/netstart
has been moved into separate scripts in
.Pa /etc/rc.d/ .
.Pp
At system startup,
.Pa /etc/rc
uses
.Xr rcorder 8
to build a dependency list of the files in
.Pa /etc/rc.d
and then executes each script in turn with an argument of
.Sq start .
Many
.Pa rc.d
scripts won't start unless the appropriate
.Xr rc.conf 5
entry in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
is set to
.Sq YES.
.Pp
At system shutdown,
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
uses
.Xr rcorder 8
to build a dependency list of the files in
.Pa /etc/rc.d
that have a
.Dq "KEYWORD: shutdown"
line, reverses the resulting list, and then executes each script in turn
with an argument of
.Sq stop .
The following scripts support a specific shutdown method:
.Pa cron ,
.Pa inetd ,
.Pa local ,
and
.Pa xdm .
.Pp
Local and third-party scripts may be installed into
.Pa /etc/rc.d
as necessary.
Refer to the other scripts in that directory and
.Xr rc 8
for more information on implementing
.Pa rc.d
scripts.
.
.It
.Xr named 8
leaks version information.
.Pp
Previous releases of
.Nx
disabled a feature of
.Xr named 8
where the version number of the server could be determined by remote clients.
This feature has not been disabled in
.Nx 1.5 ,
because there is a
.Xr named.conf 5
option to change the version string:
.(disp
 option {
        version "newstring";
 };
.disp)
.
.It
.Xr sysctl 8
was moved from
.Pa /usr/sbin/sysctl
to
.Pa /sbin/sysctl .
If you have hardcoded references to the full pathname
.Pq in shell scripts, for example
please be sure to update those.
.
.It
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration file pathname changed.
.Pp
Due to
.Xr sendmail 8
upgrade from 8.9.x to 8.10.x,
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cf
is moved to
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf .
Also, the default
.Xr sendmail.cf 5
refers different pathnames than before.
For example,
.Pa /etc/aliases
is now located at
.Pa /etc/mail/aliases ,
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cw
is now called
.Pa /etc/mail/local-host-names ,
and so forth.
If you have customized
.Xr sendmail.cf 5
and friends, you will need to move the files to the new locations.
See
.Pa /usr/share/sendmail/README
for more information.

.Ss "Using online NetBSD documentation"
.Pp
Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set.
Traditionally, the
.Dq man pages
(documentation) are denoted by
.Sq Li name(section) .
Some examples of this are
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
.Xr intro 1 ,
.It
.Xr man 1 ,
.It
.Xr apropros 1 ,
.It
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.It
.Xr passwd 5 .
.bullet)
.Pp
The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.
If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed.
For instance, after logging in, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man passwd"
.Pp
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 ,
enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man 5 passwd"
.Pp
instead.
.Pp
If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
.Ic apropos Ar subject-word
.Pp
where
.Ar subject-word
is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.
.

If you've got something to say, do so!
We'd like your input.
There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at
.Mt majordomo@netbsd.org .
To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.
.Pp
There are various mailing lists set up to deal with comments and
questions about this release.
Please send comments to:
.Mt netbsd-comments@netbsd.org .
.Pp
To report bugs, use the
.Xr send-pr 1
command shipped with
.Nx ,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.
Good bug reports include lots of details.
Additionally, bug reports can be sent by mail to:
.Mt netbsd-bugs@netbsd.org .
.Pp
Use of
.Xr send-pr 1
is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the
.Nx
bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses, or visit
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/MailingLists/ .
If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the
.Sq owner
of that port (listed
below).
.Pp
If you'd like to help with this effort, and have an idea as to how
you could be useful, send us mail or subscribe to:
.Mt netbsd-help@netbsd.org .
.Pp
As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists.
Instead, put the material you would have sent up for FTP or WWW somewhere,
then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if you'd rather not do that,
mail the list saying you'll send the data to those who want it.
