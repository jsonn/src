.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional 
.Tn Open Source
UN*X-like operating system derived from the Berkeley Networking
Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on twenty different system architectures featuring eight distinct
families of CPUs, and is being ported to more. The
.Nx \*V
release contains complete binary releases for fifteen different
machine types. (The remaining ones are not fully supported at this
time and are thus not part of the binary distribution. For information
on them, please see the NetBSD web site at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/ )
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, The X Window System,
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that 
.Nx
wouldn't exist.
.Ss Upgrade path to NetBSD 1.4.2
If you are not installing your system ``from scratch'' but instead
are going to upgrade an existing system already running
.Nx
you need to know which versions you can upgrade with
.Nx
\*V.
.Pp
.Nx
\*V is an upgrade of 
.Nx
1.4.1,
.Nx
1.4 and earlier releases of
.Nx
such as versions 1.3.3, 1.2 etc.
.Pp
The intermediate versions of code available in the main development
trunk in our CVS repository (also known as ``NetBSD-current'') from
after the point where the release cycle for 1.4 was started, are
designated by version identifiers such as 1.4A, 1.4B, 1.4P etc.
These identifiers do not desingate a release, but try to indicate
major changes in internal kernel APIs.  Note that the kernel from
.Nx
\*V can
.Em not
be used to upgrade a system running one of those development
versions.  Trying to use the
.Nx \*V
kernel on such a system
.Em will
in all probability result in problems.
.Pp
Please also note that it is not possible to do a direct ``feature-wise''
comparison between \*V and any of the intermediate development
versions mentioned above.  During the relese cycles for 1.4.1 and
\*V, selective fixes (with minor impact on the stability of the
1.4 release branch) have been imported from the main development
trunk.  So, there may be features in \*V which were not in e.g. 1.4H,
but the reverse is also true.
.Ss Major Changes Between 1.4.1 and 1.4.2
The complete list of changes between
.Nx
1.4.1 and 1.4.2 can be found in the file CHANGES-1.4.2 in the top
directory of the source tree.  The following are the highlights
only.
.Bl -bullet
.It
A driver for the Alteon Gigabit Ethernet cards has been added, see
.Xr ti 4 .
.It
A driver for the Realtek 8129/8239 Fast Ethernet PCI cards have
been added, see
.Xr rl 4 .
.It
A driver for the DPT SmartCache and SmartRAID III or IV SCSI adapters
has been added, see
.Xr dpt 4 .
.It
A driver for the BOCA IOAT66 6-port ISA serial adapter has been
added, see
.Xr ioat 4 .
.It
Support for the X-surf Amiga board has been added.
.It
Support has been added for ext2fs revision 1, with read-only support
for the ``sparse super'' and the ``filetype'' options.
.It
BIND has been upgraded to version 8.2.2-P5.
.It
The IPF packet filtering software has been updated to version 3.3.5.
.It
Tcpdump now does hex/ascii dumps of packet contents if asked to do
so.
.It
An implementation of the System V user management utilities has been
added.
.It
A utility for making temporary files for shell scripts has been
added, see
.Xr mktemp 1 .
.It
The automounter utility
.Xr amd 8
has been updated to fix a security problem.
.It
A security problem in procfs has been fixed.  Procfs is not used
by default in
.Nx .
.It
The floating point emulation on the ports using the m68k CPU has
been reverted to the version in
.Nx
1.4 (the version in 1.4.1 had problems).
.It
Several subsystems have received substantial work, such as RAIDframe,
LFS, and the package tools.
.El
.Pp
In addition, many, many bugs have been fixed -- more than 100
problems reported through our problem tracking system have been
fixed, and many other non-reported problems have also been found
and fixed.  See the CHANGES-1.4.2 file for the complete list.
.Ss Known caveats with 1.4.2
The following are the major known issues with
.Nx
1.4.2.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The upgrade of
.Xr ipf 8
caused a change of the kernel API.  Thus, if you are using
.Xr ipf 8
you need to upgrade both the kernel and the user-land utilities to
control that feature in order for it to work.
.It
As part of fixing a kernel bug, ``struct vfsnode'' needed to change
size.  This will unfortunately, and contrary to tradition for patch
releases, cause incompatibilities for users of file system LKMs
compiled for 1.4 and 1.4.1.
.It
Although LFS has been improved between 1.4.1 and 1.4.2, it can
probably still be characterized as being of ``beta test'' quality,
e.g. filling the file system still gives ``interesting'' effects.
It should probably not be used to store critical data quite yet.
.El
.Ss Major Changes Between 1.4 and 1.4.1
The complete list of changes between
.Nx
1.4 and 1.4.1 can be found in the file CHANGES-1.4.1 in the top
directory of the source tree.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The NetBSD/alpha port's compatibility for Digital UNIX executables
has been greatly improved.
.It
Many bug fixes and improvements of the installation tools and utilities.
.It
Support for more PCI serial/parallel cards has been added.
.It
It is now possible to boot NetBSD/i386 on systems with 1GB of RAM.
.It
The floating point emulation on the ports using the m68k CPU has
been upgraded.
.It
A fatal problem with /dev/random has been found and fixed.
.It
Support for Alpha 21264 ev6 based systems has been added to
NetBSD/alpha.
.El
.Ss Major Changes Between 1.3 and 1.4
.if \n[_FOR_RELEASE] \{\
The
.Nx 1.4
release is a substantial improvement over its predecessors.  We
have provided numerous significant functional enhancements, including
support for many new devices, integration of hundreds of bug fixes,
new and updated kernel subsystems, and many userland enhancements.
The results of these improvements is a stable operating system fit
for production use that rivals most commercially available systems.
.Pp
It is impossible to completely summarize the nearly two years of
development that went into the
.Nx 1.4
release. Some highlights include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Substantial improvements in the TCP/IP implementation, including
numerous performance enhancements and bug fixes by Jason Thorpe
and others.
.It
A new, high efficiency kernel memory pool allocator by Paul
Kranenburg. This has been integrated into most kernel subsystems.
.It
A new, totally rewritten virtual memory subsystem, UVM, created by
Chuck Cranor, which is substantially cleaner and better performing
than the old Mach derived VM subsystem.
.It
Improved POSIX and XPG standards compliance.
.It
Completion of the integration of all remaining
.Bx 4.4
Lite-2 kernel improvements and bug fixes that had not been previously
integrated. (Integration of all userland components was completed
before
.Nx 1.3 )
.It
Several new ports, including macppc, bebox, sparc64, next68k, and
others, have been integrated into the source tree.
.It
The system compilers have been upgraded to egcs 1.1.1, and the system
compiler toolchain now (mostly) uses the latest versions of GNU
binutils instead of the obsolete versions left over from
.Bx 4.4
Lite.
.It
Everyone's favorite
.Xr ftp 1
client has been improved even further. See the man page for details.
.It
A new architecture independent console driver,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
has been integrated into many ports.
.It
Numerous improvements have been made to the audio subsystem support,
including support for MIDI device drivers.
.It
Linux compatibility support has been improved.
.It
A number of scheduler enhancements have yielded dramatic
improvements in interactive performance and better control
of background tasks.
.It
Several network tunneling protocols, including GRE and IP in IP, have
been implemented.
.It
Kernel support for the CODA distributed file system has been added.
.It
Manuel Bouyer completed major changes to the IDE support.  It is now
architecture independent. Major changes have been made to the IDE code
for better error handling, improved ATAPI support, 32 bit data I/O
support and bus-master DMA support on PCI IDE controllers.
.It
Lennart Augustsson has added full USB support, permitting the use of a
wide variety of Universal Serial Bus peripherals. The drivers should
easily port to any future platforms that support the PCI bus.  See
.Xr usb 4
for an overview.
.It
RAIDframe, version 1.1, from the Parallel Data Laboratory at Carnegie
Mellon University, has been integrated.  Supports RAID levels 0, 1, 4,
5, and more.
.It
Luke Mewburn added
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5
functionality to the system to specify the search order for system databases.
.It
.Xr syslogd 8
now supports listening on multiple sockets, to make the
chrooting of servers easier.
.It
Most third party packages have been updated to the latest stable
release.
.El
.Pp
As has been noted, there have also been innumerable bug fixes.	
.Pp
Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems
and device drivers are shared among the different ports. You can look
for this trend to continue.

.Ss "The Future of NetBSD"
.
The
.Nx
Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization. Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the
free exchange of computer software, namely the
.Nx
Operating
System. The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the
.Nx
Project.
.Pp
The
.Nx
Foundation will help improve the quality of
.Nx
by:
.Bl -bullet
.It
providing better organization to keep track of development
efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in 
related fields.
.It
providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
services and to own the resources necessary to run the
.Nx
Project.
.It
providing a better position from which to undertake
promotional activities.
.It
periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
interested people to discuss ongoing work.
.El
.Pp
We intend to begin narrowing the time delay between releases. Our
ambition is to provide a full release every six to eight months.
.Pp
We hope to support even
.Em more
hardware in the future, and we have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
.Nx .
.Pp
We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.  In
addition, Anonymous CVS access to the NetBSD
source tree has been added since
.Nx
1.4.1; see
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Changes/#anoncvs-available
We have also added a browsable CVS repository on the web at
.Lk http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/
.Pp
We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
submit them, providing that they are well thought-out and increase the
usability of the system.
.Pp
Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of
.Nx
users, because it is for
and because of them that
.Nx
exists.

Source distribution sets; see below.
.El
.Pp
In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures for which
.Nx \*V
has a binary distribution. There are also
\&'README.export-control' files sprinkled liberally throughout the
distribution tree, which point out that there are some portions of the
distribution (i.e. the `domestic' portion) that may be subject to
export regulations of the United States.  It is your responsibility
to determine whether or not it is legal for you to export these portions
and to act accordingly.
.Pp
The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
"source" subdirectory of the distribution tree. They contain the 
complete sources to the system. The source distribution sets 
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width sharesrc.tgz...
.It secrsrc.tgz:
This set contains the "domestic" sources. These
sources may be subject to United States export
regulations.
.br
.Em 421K gzipped, 2M uncompressed
.It gnusrc.tgz:
This set contains the "gnu" sources, including
the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution
sets.
.br
.Em 19M gzipped, 84.2M uncompressed
.It syssrc.tgz:
This set contains the sources to the
.Nx \*V
kernel, config(8), and dbsym(8).
.br
.Em 13.5M gzipped, 66.7M uncompressed
.It sharesrc.tgz:
This set contains the "share" sources, which include
the sources for the man pages not associated with
any particular program, the sources for the
typesettable document set, the dictionaries, and more.
.br
.Em 3M gzipped, 11.9M uncompressed
.It src.tgz:
This set contains all of the
.Nx \*V
sources which
are not mentioned above.
.br
.Em 16.1M gzipped, 73.6M uncompressed
.El
.Pp
Most of the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree. The secrsrc.tgz set is
contained in the
.Pa source/security
subdirectory. This set, which is
available only to users in the United States and Canada, contains the
sources normally found in
.Pa /usr/src/domestic
\- primarily kerberos and
other cryptographic security related software. (Remember, because of
United States law, it may not be legal to distribute this set to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
.Pp
The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files. They may be
unpacked into
.Pa /usr/src
with the command:
.D1 Ic "cat set_name.tgz | gunzip | (cd /; tar xpf - )
.No The Pa sets/Split/
.No and Pa security/Split/
subdirectories contain split
versions of the source sets for those users who need to load the
source sets from floppy or otherwise need a split distribution. The
split sets are are named "set_name.xx" where "set_name" is the
distribution set name, and "xx" is the sequence number of the file,
starting with "aa" for the first file in the distribution set, then
"ab" for the next, and so on. All of these files except the last one
of each set should be exactly 240,640 bytes long. (The last file is
just long enough to contain the remainder of the data for that
distribution set.)
.Pp
The split distributions may be reassembled and extracted with
.Ic cat No as follows:
.D1 Ic "cat set_name.?? | gunzip | (cd /; tar xpf - )
.Pp
In each of the source distribution set directories, there is a file
named
.Pa CKSUMS
which contains the checksums of the files in that
directory, as generated by the
.Xr cksum 1
utility. You can use cksum to
check the integrity of the archives, if you suspect that one of the
files is corrupt and have access to a cksum binary. Checksums based on
other algorithms may also be present \- see the

optional. If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed. For instance, after
logging in, enter 
.D1 Ic "man passwd
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 m
enter
.D1 Ic man 5 passwd
instead.
.Pp

and fill in as much information about the problem as you can. Good
bug reports include lots of details. Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:
.Mt netbsd-bugs@NetBSD.ORG .
.Pp
Use of
.Xr send-pr 1
is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the
.Nx
bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses. If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the "owner" of that port (listed
below).
