.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional 
.Tn Open Source
UN*X-like operating system derived from the Berkeley Networking
Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on twenty different system architectures featuring eight distinct
families of CPUs, and is being ported to more. The
.Nx \*V
release contains complete binary releases for fourteen different
machine types. (The six remaining are not fully supported at this time
and are thus not part of the binary distribution. For information on
them, please see the NetBSD web site at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/ )
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages,
.Tn The X Window System ,
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that 
.Nx
wouldn't exist.
.Ss Changes Since The Last Release
.if \n[_FOR_RELEASE] \{\
The
.Nx \*V
release is a substantial improvement over its predecessors.  We have
provided numerous significant functional enhancements, including
support for many new devices, integration of hundreds of bug fixes,
new and updated kernel subsystems, and many userland enhancements. The
results of these improvements is a stable operating system fit for
production use that rivals most commercially available systems.
.Pp
It is impossible to completely summarize the nearly two years of
development that went into the
.Nx \*V
release. Some highlights include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Substantial improvements in the TCP/IP implementation, including
numerous performance enhancements and bug fixes by Jason Thorpe and
others.
.It
A new, high efficiency kernel memory pool allocator by Paul
Kranenburg. This has been integrated into most kernel subsystems.
.It
A new, totally rewritten virtual memory subsystem, UVM, created by
Chuck Cranor, which is substantially cleaner and better performing
than the old Mach derived VM subsystem.
.It
Improved POSIX and XPG standards compliance.
.It
Completion of the integration of all remaining
.Bx 4.4
Lite-2 kernel improvements and bug fixes that had not been previously
integrated. (Integration of all userland components was completed
before
.Nx 1.3 )
.It
Several new ports, including macppc, bebox, sparc64, next68k, and
others, have been integrated into the source tree.
.It
The system compilers have been upgraded to egcs 1.1.1, and the system
compiler toolchain now (mostly) uses the latest versions of GNU
binutils instead of the obsolete versions left over from
.Bx 4.4
Lite.
.It
Everyone's favorite
.Xr ftp 1
client has been improved even further. See the man page for details.
.It
A new architecture independent console driver,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
has been integrated into many ports.
.It
Numerous improvements have been made to the audio subsystem support,
including support for MIDI device drivers.
.It
Linux compatibility support has been improved.
.It
The scheduler has had several bugs fixed, yielding dramatic
improvements in interactive performance.
.It
Several network tunneling protocols, including GRE and IP in IP, have
been implemented.
.It
Kernel support for the CODA distributed file system has been added.
.It
Manuel Bouyer completed major changes to the IDE support.  It is now
architecture independent. Major changes have been made to the IDE code
for better error handling, improved ATAPI support, 32 bit data I/O
support and bus-master DMA support on PCI IDE controllers.
.It
Lennart Augustsson has added full USB support, permitting the use of a
wide variety of Universal Serial Bus peripherals. The drivers should
easily port to any future platforms that support the PCI bus.  See
.Xr usb 4
for an overview.
.It
RAIDframe, version 1.1, from the Parallel Data Laboratory at Carnegie
Mellon University, has been integrated.  Supports RAID levels 0, 1, 4,
5, and more.
.It
Luke Mewburn added
.Xr nsswitch.conf 5
functionality to the system to specify the search order for system databases.
.It
.Xr syslogd 8
now supports listening on multiple sockets, to make the
chrooting of servers easier.
.It
Most third party packages have been updated to the latest stable
release.
.El
.Pp
As has been noted, there have also been innumerable bug fixes.	
.Pp
Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems
and device drivers are shared among the different ports. You can look
for this trend to continue.

.Ss "The Future of NetBSD"
.
The
.Nx
Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization. Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the
free exchange of computer software, namely the
.Nx
Operating
System. The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the
.Nx
Project.
.Pp
The
.Nx
Foundation will help improve the quality of
.Nx
by:
.Bl -bullet
.It
providing better organization to keep track of development
efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in 
related fields.
.It
providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
services and to own the resources necessary to run the
.Nx
Project.
.It
providing a better position from which to undertake
promotional activities.
.It
periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
interested people to discuss ongoing work.
.El
.Pp
We intend to begin narrowing the time delay between releases. Our
ambition is to provide a full release every six to eight months.
.Pp
We hope to support even
.Em more
hardware in the future, and we have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
.Nx .
.Pp
We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.  In
addition, we intend to provide Anonymous CVS access to the NetBSD
source tree in the near future, so that anyone on the internet can
examine the full NetBSD source code repository.
.Pp
We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
submit them, providing that they are well thought-out and increase the
usability of the system.
.Pp
Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of
.Nx
users, because it is for
and because of them that
.Nx
exists.

.Ss "NetBSD \*V Release Contents
.
The root directory of the

.It Li patches/
Post-release source code patches.
.It Li source/
Source distribution sets; see below.
.El
.Pp
In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures for which
.Nx \*V
has a binary distribution. There are also
\&'README.export-control' files sprinkled liberally throughout the
distribution tree, which point out that there are some portions of the
distribution (i.e. the `domestic' portion) that may be subject to
export regulations of the United States.  It is your responsibility
to determine whether or not it is legal for you to export these portions
and to act accordingly.
.Pp
The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
"source" subdirectory of the distribution tree. They contain the 
complete sources to the system. The source distribution sets 
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width sharesrc.tgz...
.It secrsrc.tgz:
This set contains the "domestic" sources. These
sources may be subject to United States export
regulations.
.br
.Em 412K gzipped, 1.8M uncompressed
.It gnusrc.tgz:
This set contains the "gnu" sources, including
the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution
sets.
.br
.Em 15.6M gzipped, 66.4M uncompressed
.It syssrc.tgz:
This set contains the sources to the
.Nx \*V
kernel, config(8), and dbsym(8).
.br
.Em 10.7M gzipped, 50.0M uncompressed
.It sharesrc.tgz:
This set contains the "share" sources, which include
the sources for the man pages not associated with
any particular program, the sources for the
typesettable document set, the dictionaries, and more.
.br
.Em 2.9M gzipped, 11.1M uncompressed
.It src.tgz:
This set contains all of the
.Nx \*V
sources which
are not mentioned above.
.br
.Em 13.9M gzipped, 60.7M uncompressed
.El
.Pp
Most of the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree. The secrsrc.tgz set is
contained in the
.Pa source/security
subdirectory. This set, which is
available only to users in the United States and Canada, contains the
sources normally found in
.Pa /usr/src/domestic
\- primarily kerberos and
other cryptographic security related software. (Remember, because of
United States law, it may not be legal to distribute this set to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
.Pp
The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files. They may be
unpacked into
.Pa /usr/src
with the command:
.D1 Ic "cat set_name.tgz | gunzip | (cd /; tar xpf - )
.No The Pa sets/Split/
.No and Pa security/Split/
subdirectories contain split
versions of the source sets for those users who need to load the
source sets from floppy or otherwise need a split distribution. The
split sets are are named "set_name.xx" where "set_name" is the
distribution set name, and "xx" is the sequence number of the file,
starting with "aa" for the first file in the distribution set, then
"ab" for the next, and so on. All of these files except the last one
of each set should be exactly 240,640 bytes long. (The last file is
just long enough to contain the remainder of the data for that
distribution set.)
.Pp
The split distributions may be reassembled and extracted with
.Ic cat No as follows:
.D1 Ic "cat set_name.?? | gunzip | (cd /; tar xpf - )
.Pp
In each of the source distribution set directories, there is a file
named
.Pa CKSUMS
which contains the checksums of the files in that
directory, as generated by the
.Xr cksum 1
utility. You can use cksum to
check the integrity of the archives, if you suspect that one of the
files is corrupt and have access to a cksum binary. Checksums based on
other algorithms may also be present \*- see the
.Xr release 7
man page for details.

following problems and compatibility issues in mind when upgrading to
.Nx \*V
.Pp
.Em NOTE: ALL THESE ARE OBSOLETE PROBLEMS.
They cover the 1.2->1.3 transition. We need new information for 1.4!!!
.Pp
.
.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Swap configuration
.
.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Description
All swap partitions are now configured by the swapctl(8)
program. The kernel no longer configures a default swap
partition. Because of this, all swap partitions
.No must be listed in Pa /etc/fstab .
.Pp
Many users of previous releases relied on the kernel
configuring a "default" swap partition and did not list any swap space in
.Pa /etc/fstab
at all -- such users will now have no
swap space configured unless they list swap partitions in
.Pa /etc/fstab !
.Pp
Common symptoms of of this problem include machine crashes
during builds, and similar memory intensive activities.
.It Fix
The most common position for a swap partition is the `b'
partition of the drive the root file system is on. For
diskless systems, check the new swapctl(8) manual for more
detail on how this is done. Example fstab entries:
.
.Bl -column /dev/sd0bxx nonexx swapxx sw,priority=0xx
.It /dev/sd0b Ta none Ta swap Ta sw,priority=0
.It /dev/sd1b Ta none Ta swap Ta sw,priority=5
.El
.
.El
.
.It
NFS now uses reserved ports
.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Description
Earlier versions of
.Nx
did not use a reserved (\*(<= 1023)
port when making NFS client requests. When acting as a server
NetBSD now requires reserved ports by default.
.Pp
Old clients mounting a new server will receive a 'permission
denied' response when the directory is accessed. New clients
should work fine with old servers.
.It Fix
Add '-P' to the mount options in the old client's
.Pa /etc/fstab ,
or (less preferred), add
.Li \&-noresvport,noresvmnt
to the options on the new server's
.Pa /etc/exports .
.El
.
.It
NFS daemons and other programs in /sbin moved
.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Description
The NFS daemons (nfsd, nfsiod, mountd) have been moved from
the
.Pa /sbin
to the
.Pa /usr/sbin directory .
When new binaries are
loaded over old ones during upgrade, most programs get
overlaid and replaced, but unless these binaries are
explicitly removed they will not disappear. The installation
subsystems on some
.Nx
architectures will not properly
remove these binaries.
.Pp
Due to changes in the NFS subsystem, the old NFS daemon
binaries will not work correctly, and will cause serious
problems. Unfortunately, the default startup script
.Pq Pa /etc/rc
will run the old binaries in
.Pa /sbin
if they are present instead of the new ones in
.Pa /usr/sbin .
.Pp
Some other programs (dumpfs, dumplfs and quotacheck) have also
been moved from
.Pa /sbin
to
.Pa /usr/sbin ,
and old versions may be
left behind by accident. They, too, may cause difficulties.
.It Fix
Remove the old daemon binaries
.Pp Pa (/sbin/nfsiod ,
.Pa /sbin/nfsd ,
.Pa /sbin/mountd ,
.Pq etc.
after your upgrade has finished. You may
wish to do an 
.D1 Ic "ls -lt /sbin | more
to help determine which
binaries were not replaced/removed during your upgrade.

.Ss "Using online NetBSD documentation"
.Pp
Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set. Traditionally, the
.Dq man pages
(documentation) are denoted by 
.Dq Li name(section) .
Some examples of this are
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
.Xr intro 1 ,
.It
.Xr man 1 ,
.It
.Xr apropros 1 ,
.It
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.It
.Xr passwd 5 .
.El
.Pp
The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional. If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed. For instance, after
logging in, enter 
.D1 Ic "man passwd
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 m
enter
.D1 Ic man 5 passwd
instead.
.Pp
If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
.Ic apropos Ar subject-word
.Pp
where
.Ar subject-word
is your topic of interest; a list of possibly 
related man pages will be displayed.
