.Ss "Quick install notes for the impatient"
.Pp
This section contains some brief notes describing what you need to
install
.Nx \*V
on a machine of the \*M architecture.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Fetch the
.if r_i386 \{\
appropriate pair of boot floppy images from the
.Pa installation/floppy/
directory.  Most people will need the
.Pa boot1.fs
and
.Pa boot2.fs
images, or possibly (but not necessarily)
.Pa bootlap1.fs
and
.Pa bootlap2.fs
if installing on a laptop.
.\}
.if r_macppc \{\
boot floppy image
.Pa installation/boot.fs
and bootloader
.Pa installation/ofwboot.xcf ,
or the CD image,
.Pa macppc_bootable.iso .
You only need the floppy image and bootloader, or the CD image to boot
your system.
.\}
.if r_sparc \{\
CD image,
.Pa sparc_bootable.iso
or the floppy disk images,
.Pa install/floppy/disk1.gz No and Pa install/floppy/disk2 .
You need either the pair of floppies or the CD to boot your system.
.\}
.if \n[macppc]:\n[sparc] \{\
Alternatively, you may netboot the installation kernel, which requires
several local netboot services.  The details are not covered here, as
setting up a netboot server is hardly 
.Dq quick .
.\}
.It
The actual binary distribution is in the
.Pa binary/sets/
directory.
When you boot the install
.if r_i386 floppies,
.if r_macppc floppy or CD-ROM,
.if r_sparc floppies or CD-ROM,
the installation program
can fetch these files for you (using e.g. ftp),
if you have a network connection.
There are several other methods to get the binary sets onto
the machine you install.
.Pp
You will at a minimum need
.ie r_i386 \{\
one of the kernel sets, typically
.Pa kern.tgz ,
as well as
.\}
.el \{\
the following sets:
.Pa kern.tgz ,
.\}
.Pa base.tgz
and
.Pa etc.tgz .
In a typical workstation installation you will probably want
all the installation sets.
.if \n[i386] \{
.It
Write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies.
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy,
the
.Ic rawrite.exe
MS-DOS program
or the
.Ic Rawrite32.exe
Windows32 program (inside
.Pa rawrite32.zip )
in the
.Pa utilities/
directory may be of help.
.\}
.if \n[macppc] \{
.It
If your mac has a floppy drive,
write the floppy image directly to a floppy disk.
Otherwise, drag the uncompressed floppy image and bootloader to your
hard drive icon (the top level of the drive, not the desktop).  If you are
making a CD, burn it now.
If you have problems writing a raw image to a floppy, the
.Ic suntar
.Tn MacOS
program may be of help.
.\}
.if \n[sparc] \{
.It
Make sure your sparc's CD-ROM drive is bootable.  Burn the CD.  Otherwise,
write the floppy images directly to a pair of floppies (after
uncompressing disk1.gz).
.\}
.Pp
The disk(s) you just prepared will be used to boot the installation
kernel, which contains all the tools required to install
.Nx .
.if r_macppc \{\
.It
Determine your machine's model, quirks, and Open Firmware version from the
.Nx*M
Model Support webpage.
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/macppc/models.html
.Pp
At present,
.Nx*M
cannot exist on the same hard drive as
.Tn MacOS
unless you partition your disk using a
.Tn MacOS
partitioning utility.  Open Firmware versions prior to 3 cannot boot into
.Nx
on a drive partitioned this way -- you must use the entire disk,
partitioned with the installation tools.  Open Firmware version 3 cannot
boot into
.Nx
on a drive partitioned with the installation tools, you must use a
.Tn MacOS
partitioning utility and the
.Dq Me "Re-install sets or install additional sets"
option in the installer (selecting the
.Dq Me "Install NetBSD to hard disk"
or
.Dq Me "Upgrade NetBSD on a hard disk"
options will render your drive unbootable).  If you are unsure, you may
want to read the section below on
.Sx Partitioning your hard drive for NetBSD
.It
For systems with Open Firmware versions prior to 3, you may need to use
Apple's System Disk utility to enter Open Firmware and use your screen and
keyboard.  To enter Open Firmware, hold down the
.Key COMMAND-OPTION-O-F
keys after the boot chime starts, but before it ends.  Entering Open
Firmware versions prior to 3 is usually the most frustrating part of
installation -- you may want to read the section below on
.Sx Older Open Firmware System Preparation
.Pp
You should have the Open Firmware
.Dq Pa "0 >"
prompt on your screen before attempting to boot
.Nx*M .
.\}
.if r_macppc \{\
.It
At the Open Firmware prompt, type the command to boot.  For the boot
floppy, the command is
.Dq Ic "boot fd:0" .
For the boot floppy image and bootloader on your hard drive (Open Firmware
3), the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot hd:9,ofwboot.xcf hd:9,boot.fs" .
You may need to replace both 9's with your drive's partition number.
.Pp
For boot CDs, the command is something like
.Dq Ic "boot cd:,\eofwboot.xcf netbsd.macppc"
(for Open Firmware 3) or
.Dq Ic "boot scsi-int/sd@3:0,\eOFWBOOT.XCF NETBSD.MACPPC"
(for earlier Open Firmware versions).
You will need to use the correct case for
.Ic OFWBOOT.XCF No and Ic NETBSD.MACPPC
depending on how your version of Open Firmware interprets the ISO 
filesystem.  You may need to replace
.Ic cd
with
.Ic "scsi/sd@3 , scsi-int/sd@3 , scsi-ext/sd@3 , ata/atapi-disk ,"
or some other device alias.  You should also use the Open Firmware
.Ic dir
command to confirm that the
.Nx*M
kernel is called
.Pa NETBSD.MACPPC .
.\}
.if r_sparc \{\
.It
You will need to get to the OpenBoot PROM
.Dq Ic "ok"
prompt.  After your system first powers on, and displays some initial
information, press the
.Key STOP-A
keys.  At the
.Dq Ic "ok"
prompt, type the command to boot your system into
.Nx .
The command to boot from CD is one of the following commands (depending on
your model):
.Dq Ic b sd(,30,) ,
.Dq Ic boot sd(,30,) ,
or
.Dq Ic boot cdrom .
.Pp
The command to boot from floppy is either
.Dq Ic boot fd(,,1)
or
.Dq Ic boot floppy .
The installer will prompt you to insert the second floppy when it is ready
for it.

.It
For third-party programs which are not part of the base
.Nx
distribution, you will want to explore the
.Ic pkgsrc
system with its more than 2100 program packages.

.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional
.Tn Open Source
.Ul
operating system derived from the University of California, Berkeley
Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite, and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on thirty-one different system architectures featuring twelve distinct
families of CPUs, and is being ported to more. The
.Nx \*V
release contains complete binary releases for fifteen different
machine types. (The sixteen remaining are not fully supported at this time
and are thus not part of the binary distribution. For information on
them, please see the
.Nx
web site at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/ . )
.Pp
.Nx
is a completely integrated system.
In addition to its highly portable, high performance kernel,
.nh
.Nx
features a complete set of user utilities, compilers for several
languages, the X Window System, firewall software
and numerous other tools, all accompanied by full source code.
.Pp
.\" XXX Should we include some text here about NetBSD's license
.\" policies and how commercial-friendly it is?
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that
.Nx
wouldn't exist.
.Ss Upgrade path to NetBSD 1.5.2
If you are not installing your system ``from scratch'' but instead
are going to upgrade an existing system already running
.Nx
you need to know which versions you can upgrade with
.Nx
1.5.2.
.Pp
.Nx
1.5.2 is an upgrade of
.Nx
1.5, 1.5.1, and earlier major and patch releases of
.Nx .
.Pp
The intermediate development versions of code available on the main trunk
in our CVS repository (also known as ``NetBSD-current'') from
.Em after
the point where the release cycle for 1.5 was started are designated
by version identifiers such as 1.5A, 1.5B, etc.
These identifiers do not designate releases, but indicate major changes
in internal kernel APIs.
Note that the kernel from
.Nx
1.5.2 can
.Em not
be used to upgrade a system running one of those intermediate development
versions.
Trying to use the
.Nx
1.5.2 kernel on such a system
.Em will
probably result in problems.
.Pp
Please also note that it is not possible to do a direct ``version''
comparison between any of the intermediate development versions mentioned
above and 1.5.2 to determine if a given feature is present or absent
in 1.5.2.  The development of 1.5 and the subsequent ``point'' releases
is done on a separate branch in the CVS repository. The branch was created when
the release cycle for 1.5 was started, and during the release cycle of
1.5 and its patch releases, selected fixes and enhancements have been
imported from the main development trunk.
So, there are features in 1.5.2 which were not in, e.g. 1.5B, and vice
versa.
.Ss Major Changes Between 1.5.1 and 1.5.2
The main purpose of
.Nx
1.5.2 is to fix some problems discovered shortly after the release of
.Nx
1.5.1.
Some highlights are:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Xr telnetd 8
has been fixed to deal with a security issue (SA2001-012).
.It
A weakness in the OpenSSL libcrypto's pseudo random number generator
has been fixed (SA2001-013). 
.It

.El
.Pp
In addition, many bugs have been fixed\(emmore than 95 problems
reported through our problem tracking system have been fixed,
and some other non-reported problems have also been found and fixed.
See the CHANGES-1.5.1 file for the complete list.
.Pp
The NetBSD Packages Collection (pkgsrc) which is used to maintain,
build, track dependencies, and maintain NetBSD-specific fixes to
third-party programs, has received a major overhaul for NetBSD 1.5.1.
Some highlights are:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Many new packages were added to the collection, which now includes
about 2100 packages.  Many of them are also available as pre-compiled
binaries on ftp.netbsd.org and its mirrors.  Many packages have been
modified and enhanced to compile and function properly on big-endian
(m68k, sparc), and LP64 architectures (alpha, sparc64).
.It
KDE2 and KOffice together consitutes a fully integrated office
environment with no license problems, available for i386, alpha and
many other architectures.
.It
Mozilla 0.9, KDE2's Konqueror, and Links 0.95 are just a few
examples of the web browsers available.
.It
A support package for running VMware on NetBSD/i386 was added, it's
called suse_vmware.  The official VMware code, a valid license, and
Wasabi Systems' compatibility package are all needed to run VMware.
.It
Internal changes of the pkgsrc system include strong checksums to
prevent malicious distribution files, as well as restructuring of the
package structure in pkgsrc for faster extraction of pkgsrc tar files
and upgrades via SUP and CVS.
.El
.Pp
Please note that at the moment,
.Ic sysinst
will not assist you in
installing pre-built third-party binary packages or the pkgsrc
system itself, so you will have to manually install packages using
.Ic pkg_install
or fetch and extract the pkgsrc.tgz tar file to get started.
.Pp
Lastly, it should be noted that the X11 binaries shipped in
.Nx
\*V
is still based on XFree86 version 3.3.6.
Several newer graphics cards are inadequately supported
by that code base, but on the other hand support for several
older graphics cards is not available in newer XFree86 code.
.Nx
is in the process of moving to XFree86 version 4, and is currently
maintaining both the XFree86 3.3.6 and the XFree86 version 4 code
in the
.Sy xsrc
source set, and you may at compile time pick which sources to
build and install.
To ease installation, testing and use of the XFree86 version 4
code, a binary snapshot based on XFree86
version 4.0.3 will be made available for at least the i386
architecture shortly after the release of
.Nx
\*V.

.Ss New Compatibility Issues Introduced With NetBSD 1.5.1
.Pp
With the increase of the maximum number of partitions from 8 to 16
on the i386 port, it is worth noting:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Once you start using more than 8 partitions, you can no longer
downgrade to a 1.5 kernel.
.It
The user-land tools which handle disklabels in 1.5.1 can not be
used under a 1.5 kernel.
.El
.\}
.Ss Changes Between The NetBSD 1.4 and 1.5 Releases
.Pp
The
.Nx 1.5
release 
provides numerous significant functional enhancements, including
support for many new devices, integration of hundreds of bug fixes,
new and updated kernel subsystems, and many userland enhancements. The
result of these improvements is a stable operating system fit for
production use that rivals most commercially available systems.
.Pp
It is impossible to completely summarize over one year of
development that went into the
.Nx \*V
release. Some highlights include:
.
.Ss2 Kernel
.
.(bullet
Ports to new platforms including:
arc,
cobalt,
hpcmips,
news68k,
sgimips,
and
sparc64.
.It
Improved performance and stability of the UVM virtual memory subsystem.
.It
Implementation of generic kernel locking code, as well as a
restructure and re-tuning of the scheduler, to be used by the
future symmetric multi-processing (SMP) implementation.
.It
Improved compatibility support for Linux, OSF1, and SVR4 programs.
.It
New compatibility support for Win32 programs.
.It
Support for dynamically loaded ELF kernel modules.
.It
Kernel process tracing using
.Xr ktruss 1 .
.It
Deletion of swap devices using
.Xr swapctl 8 .
.It
Easier hot-pluggability of keyboards and mice using a new wscons
device\(emwsmux.
.It
Improved PCMCIA and CardBus support, including support for detaching
of devices and cards, resulting in better support for notebooks and
PDA devices.
.It
Numerous hardware improvements, including areas such as:
audio, UDMA/66 support for ATA drives, USB, and wireless networking.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 Networking
.
.(bullet
Addition of IP version 6 (IPv6) and IPsec to the networking stack,
from the KAME project.
This includes addition of kernel code for IPv6/IPsec,
IPv4/v6 dual-stack user applications and supporting libraries.
Due to this, the shlib major version for
.Xr pcap 3
is incremented and you may need to recompile userland tools.
The KAME IPv6 part includes results from the unified-IPv6 effort.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 File system
.
.(bullet
Significant Fast file system (FFS) performance enhancements via
integration of Kirk McKusick's soft updates and trickle sync code.
.It
Support for the 
.Tn "Windows NT"
.Sq NTFS
file system (read-only at this stage).
.It
Support for revision 1 of the
.Tn Linux
.Sq ext2fs
file system.
.It
Enhanced stability and usability of LFS (the
.Bx
log-structured file system).
.It
Various RAIDframe enhancements including: auto-detection of RAID components
and auto-configuration of RAID sets, and the ability to configure the root
file system
.Pq Pa /
on a RAID set.
.It
Support for
.Tn Microsoft
Joliet extensions to the ISO9660 CD file system.
.It
Improved file system vnode locking mechanisms,
thus resolving a source of several panics in the past.
.It
Support for NFS and RPC over IPv6.
.It
The server part of NFS locking (implemented by
.Xr rpc.lockd 8 )
now works.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 Security
.
.(bullet
Strong cryptographic libraries and applications integrated,
including the AES cipher Rijndael, the OpenSSL library, more
complete Kerberos IV and Kerberos V support, and an SSH server
and client.
.It
.Xr sysctl 3
interfaces to various elements of process and system information,
allowing programs such as
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr dmesg 1
and the like to operate without recompilation after kernel upgrades,
and remove the necessity to run setgid kmem (thus improving system
security).
.It
Disable various services by default, and set the default options for
disabled daemons to a higher level of logging.
.It 
Several code audits were performed. One audit replaced string routines
that were used without bounds checking, and another one identified and
disabled places where format strings were used in unsafe ways,
allowing arbitrary data to be entered by (possibly) malicious users to
overwrite application code, and leading from Denial of Service attacks
to compromised systems.
.It
.Xr sshd 8
and
.Xr ssh 1
now require
.Xr rnd 4
kernel random number devices.
.bullet)
.
.Ss2 System administration and user tools
.
.(bullet
Conversion of the
.Xr rc 8
system startup and shutdown scripts to an
.Sq rc.d
mechanism, with separate control scripts for each service, and
appropriate dependency ordering provided by
.Xr rcorder 8 .
.It
.Xr postfix 1
provided as alternative mail transport agent to
.Xr sendmail 8 .
.It
User management tools
.Xr useradd 8 ,
.Xr usermod 8 ,
.Xr userdel 8 ,
.Xr groupadd 8 ,
.Xr groupmod 8 ,
and
.Xr groupdel 8
added to the system.
.It
Incorporation of a login class capability database
.Pq Pa /etc/login.conf
from
.Tn BSD/OS .
.It
Improved support for usernames longer than eight characters in programs
such as
.Xr at 1
and
.Xr w 1 .
.It
Many enhancements to
.Xr ftpd 8
providing features found in larger and less secure FTP daemons,
such as user classes, connection limits, improved support for
virtual hosting, transfer statistics, transfer rate throttling,
and support for various IETF ftpext working group extensions.
.It
The
.Xr ftp 1
client has been improved even further, including
transfer rate throttling, improved URL support, command line uploads.
See the man page for details.

.Ss "The Future of NetBSD"
.Pp
.
The
.Nx
Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization. Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the
free exchange of computer software, namely the
.Nx
Operating
System. The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the
.Nx
Project.
.Pp
The
.Nx
Foundation will help improve the quality of
.Nx
by:
.(bullet
providing better organization to keep track of development
efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in
related fields.
.It
providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
services and to own the resources necessary to run the
.Nx
Project.
.It
providing a better position from which to undertake
promotional activities.
.It
periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
interested people to discuss ongoing work.
.bullet)
.Pp
We intend to begin narrowing the time delay between releases. Our
ambition is to provide a full release every six to eight months.
.Pp
We hope to support even
.Em more
hardware in the future, and we have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
.Nx .
.Pp
We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.
.Pp
We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
submit them, providing that they are well thought-out and increase the
usability of the system.
.Pp
Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of
.Nx
users, because it is for
and because of them that
.Nx
exists.

.Ss "NetBSD \*V Release Contents
.Pp
.
The root directory of the
.Nx \*V
release is organized as follows:
.ie \n[FOR_RELEASE] \{\
.Pp
.Pa .../NetBSD-\*V/
.(tag README.files
.It Li CHANGES
Changes since earlier

.It Li TODO
.Nx 's
todo list (also somewhat incomplete and out of date).
.It Pa patches/
Post-release source code patches.
.It Pa source/
Source distribution sets; see below.
.tag)
.Pp
In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures for which
.Nx \*V
has a binary distribution.
There are also
.Pa README.export-control
files sprinkled liberally throughout the
distribution tree, which point out that there are some portions of the
distribution that may be subject to
export regulations of the United States, e.g.
code under
.Pa src/crypto
and
.Pa src/sys/crypto . 
It is your responsibility
to determine whether or not it is legal for you to export these portions
and to act accordingly.
.Pp
The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
.Pa source
subdirectory of the distribution tree. They contain the
complete sources to the system. The source distribution sets
are as follows:
.(tag sharesrc
.It Sy gnusrc
This set contains the
.Dq gnu
sources, including the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution sets.
.br
.Em 22.3 MB gzipped, 98.8 MB uncompressed
.It Sy pkgsrc
This set contains the
.Dq pkgsrc
sources, which contain the infrastructure to build third-party packages.
.br
.Em 7.4 MB gzipped, 73.0 MB uncompressed
.It Sy sharesrc
This set contains the
.Dq share
sources, which include the sources for the man pages not associated
with any particular program; the sources for the typesettable document
set; the dictionaries; and more.
.br
.Em 3.3 MB gzipped, 13.2 MB uncompressed
.It Sy src
This set contains all of the base
.Nx \*V
sources which are not in
.Sy gnusrc ,
.Sy sharesrc ,
or
.Sy syssrc .
.br
.Em 24.8 MB gzipped, 123.1 MB uncompressed
.It Sy syssrc

.Nx \*V
kernel for all architectures;
.Xr config 8 ;
and
.Xr dbsym 8 .
.br
.Em 18.0 MB gzipped, 90.9 MB uncompressed
.It Sy xsrc
This set contains the sources to the X Window System.
.br
.Em 78.1 MB gzipped, 393.6 MB uncompressed
.tag)
.Pp
All the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree.
.Pp
The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files. They may be
unpacked into
.Pa /usr/src
with the command:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "( cd / ; tar -zxpf - ) < set_name.tgz"
.Pp
The
.Pa sets/Split/
subdirectory contains split
versions of the source sets for those users who need to load the
source sets from floppy or otherwise need a split distribution. The
split sets are named
.Pa "set_name." Ns Ar xx
where
.Pa set_name
is the distribution set name, and
.Ar xx
is the sequence number of the file,
starting with
.Dq aa
for the first file in the distribution set, then
.Dq ab
for the next, and so on. All of these files except the last one
of each set should be exactly 240,640 bytes long. (The last file is
just long enough to contain the remainder of the data for that
distribution set.)
.Pp
The split distributions may be reassembled and extracted with
.Ic cat
as follows:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cat set_name.?? | ( cd / ; tar -zxpf - )"
.Pp
In each of the source distribution set directories, there are
files which contain the checksums of the files in the directory:
.(tag SYSVSUM -offset indent
.It Li BSDSUM
Historic
.Bx
checksums for the various files
in that directory, in the format produced by the command:
.Ic cksum -o 1 Ar file .
.It Li CKSUM
.Tn POSIX
checksums for the various files in that
directory, in the format produced by the command:
.Ic cksum Ar file .
.It Li MD5
.Tn MD5
digests for the various files in that
directory, in the format produced by the command:
.Ic cksum Fl m Ar file .
.It Li SYSVSUM
Historic AT\*&T System V
.Ux
checksums for the various files in that directory, in the format produced by
the command:
.Ic cksum Fl o 2 Ar file .
.tag)
.Pp
The MD5 digest is the safest checksum, followed by the POSIX
checksum. The other two checksums are provided only to ensure
that the widest possible range of system can check the integrity
of the release files.

.Pp
.
Users upgrading from previous versions of
.Nx
may wish to bear the
following problems and compatibility issues in mind when upgrading to
.Nx \*V .
.Ss2 General issues
.(bullet
.Pa /etc/rc
modified to use
.Pa /etc/rc.d/*
.Pp
Prior to 
.Nx 1.5 ,
.Pa /etc/rc
was a traditional
.Bx
style monolithic file; each discrete program or substem from
.Pa /etc/rc
and
.Pa /etc/netstart
has been moved into separate scripts in
.Pa /etc/rc.d/ .
.Pp
At system startup,
.Pa /etc/rc
uses
.Xr rcorder 8
to build a dependency list of the files in
.Pa /etc/rc.d
and then executes each script in turn with an argument of
.Sq start .
Many
.Pa rc.d
scripts won't start unless the appropriate
.Xr rc.conf 5
entry in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
is set to
.Sq YES.
.Pp
At system shutdown,
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
uses
.Xr rcorder 8
to build a dependency list of the files in
.Pa /etc/rc.d
that have a
.Dq "KEYWORD: shutdown"
line, reverses the resulting list, and then executes each script in turn
with an argument of
.Sq stop .
The following scripts support a specific shutdown method:
.Pa cron ,
.Pa inetd ,
.Pa local ,
and
.Pa xdm .
.Pp
Local and third-party scripts may be installed into
.Pa /etc/rc.d
as necessary.
Refer to the other scripts in that directory and
.Xr rc 8
for more information on implementing
.Pa rc.d
scripts.
.bullet)
.Ss2 Issues affecting an upgrade from NetBSD 1.4 or prior
.(bullet
.Xr named 8
leaks version information
.
.Pp
Previous releases of
.Nx
disabled a feature of
.Xr named 8
where the version number of the server could be determined by remote clients.
This feature has not been disabled in
.Nx 1.5 ,
because there is a
.Xr named.conf 5
option to change the version string:
.(disp
 option {
	version "newstring";
 };
.disp)
.
.It
.Xr sysctl 8
pathname changed
.
.Pp
.Xr sysctl 8
is moved from
.Pa /usr/sbin/sysctl
to
.Pa /sbin/sysctl .
If you have hardcoded references to the full pathname
.Pq in shell scripts, for example
please be sure to update those.
.\"
.It
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration file pathname changed
.
.Pp
Due to
.Xr sendmail 8
upgrade from 8.9.x to 8.10.x,
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cf
is moved to
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf .
Also, the default
.Xr sendmail.cf 5
refers different pathnames than before.
For example,
.Pa /etc/aliases
is now located at
.Pa /etc/mail/aliases ,
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cw
is now called
.Pa /etc/mail/local-host-names ,
and so forth.
If you have customized
.Xr sendmail.cf 5
and friends, you will need to move the files to the new locations.
See
.Pa /usr/share/sendmail/README
for more information.
.bullet)
.
.Pp
.
.
.Ss "Using online NetBSD documentation"
.Pp
Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set. Traditionally, the
.Dq man pages
(documentation) are denoted by
.Sq Li name(section) .
Some examples of this are
.Pp
.(bullet -compact -offset indent
.Xr intro 1 ,
.It
.Xr man 1 ,
.It
.Xr apropros 1 ,
.It
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.It
.Xr passwd 5 .
.bullet)
.Pp
The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional. If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed. For instance, after
logging in, enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man passwd"
.Pp
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 ,
enter
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "man 5 passwd"
.Pp
instead.
.Pp
If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
.Ic apropos Ar subject-word
.Pp
where
.Ar subject-word
is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.
.
.Ss Administrivia

If you've got something to say, do so! We'd like your input.
There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at
.Mt majordomo@netbsd.org .
To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.
.Pp
There are various mailing lists set up to deal with comments and
questions about this release. Please send comments to:
.Mt netbsd-comments@netbsd.org .
.Pp
To report bugs, use the
.Xr send-pr 1
command shipped with
.Nx ,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can. Good
bug reports include lots of details. Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:
.Mt netbsd-bugs@netbsd.org .
.Pp
Use of
.Xr send-pr 1
is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the
.Nx
bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.
.Pp
There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of
.Nx .
Use majordomo to find their addresses, or visit
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/MailingLists/ .
If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the
.Sq owner
of that port (listed
below).
.Pp
If you'd like to help with this effort, and have an idea as to how
you could be useful, send us mail or subscribe to:
.Mt netbsd-help@netbsd.org .
.Pp
As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists. Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP or WWW somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.
