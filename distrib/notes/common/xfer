For laptops that have cardbus slots, you should use the

For older machines with little RAM, use

This image is tailored towards old, small-memory systems, and thus does
not contain any PCI or SCSI support.
It should work on systems with 4M of RAM.
Note that this means 4M available to NetBSD; systems that
are said to have 4M may have 640k of base memory and 3072k of extended
memory, which currently will not work, as this is a total of 3712k.

For old machines that may have EISA, SCSI and more RAM, but only
have a 1.2M floppy drive, use

If you choose the second method, you have to make the boot floppy

The image file can be found in

distribution.
.Pp
If you are using a

directory of the

distribution.
PC versions can be found in
.Pa i386/installation/misc .
It will write the file system images (.fs files) to disks.
.Pp
To use the boot floppy, insert the floppy to your floppy drive 0,
and reboot your computer with OPT.1 key pressed.
.Pp
If you have less than 5MB of memory, you have to use the
`floppy-root' installation system instead of the above
`ramdisk-root' installation system.
`Floppy-root' installation
system is composed of two floppies, `kern' and `inst'.
They are made from the floppy images
.Pa kern.fs
and
.Pa inst.fs
respectively, both of which are found in
.Pa installation/floppy
directory of the
.Nx

The
.Pa inst.fs
file needs to be uncompressed from
.Pa inst.fs.gz

.Ic gzip.x
program with the
.Fl d

See above how to write the images to floppies.
.Pp
To start the `floppy-root' installation system, insert the `kern' floppy
to your floppy drive 0, and reboot your computer with OPT.1 key pressed.
When you are prompted that `Insert file system floppy and press return.',
replace the `kern' floppy with `inst' floppy and press return key.
.Pp
Once booted, the `floppy-root' installation system is identical with
the `ramdisk-root' installation system, except that the former constantly
accesses the floppy disk.
Floppy disks are relatively unreliable media and cause some warning messages
to report access errors, most of which are corrected and can be ignored.
With the latter installation system the floppy disk is not used once the
system has booted off and can be removed from the drive.
