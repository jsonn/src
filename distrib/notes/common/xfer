If you are not booting off a CD-ROM, you will need to have some floppy
disks to boot off;
either two 1.44 MB floppies or one 1.2 MB floppy.
.Pp
For laptops that have cardbus slots, you should use the
.Pa bootlap1.fs
and
.Pa bootlap2.fs
floppy images.
.Pp
For older machines with little RAM, use
.Pa boot-tiny.fs .
This image is tailored towards old, small-memory systems, and thus does
not contain any PCI or SCSI support.
It should work on systems with 4M of RAM.
Note that this means 4M available to NetBSD; systems that
are said to have 4M may have 640k of base memory and 3072k of extended
memory, which currently will not work, as this is a total of 3712k.
.Pp
For old machines that may have EISA, SCSI and more RAM, but only
have a 1.2M floppy drive, use
.Pa boot-small1.fs

For old IBM PS/2 machines with MCA, use
.Pa boot-ps2-1.fs

For all other systems, use

For the 2-floppy sets (and the CD boot image), utilities to repair
a badly crashed systems are included.
The
.Pa boot-tiny.fs
image has a separate
.Pa rescue-tiny.fs
rescue floppy image because of lack of space.

If you are using a

To invoke the installation system, just type

When you chose the second method, you have to make the boot floppy
from the floppy image

The image file can be found in
.Pa x68k/installation/floppy
directory of the
.Nx
distribution.

If you are using a

system to write the floppy image to
disks, you should use the

directory of the
.Nx
distribution.
PC versions can be found in
.Pa i386/installation/misc .

.Pp
To use the boot floppy, insert the floppy to your floppy drive 0,
and reboot your computer with OPT.1 key pressed.
.Pp
If you have less than 5MB of memory, you have to use the
`floppy-root' installation system instead of the above
`ramdisk-root' installation system.
`Floppy-root' installation
system is composed of two floppies, `kern' and `inst'.
They are made from the floppy images
.Pa kern.fs
and
.Pa inst.fs
respectively, both of which are found in
.Pa installation/floppy
directory of the
.Nx
distribution.
The
.Pa inst.fs
file needs to be uncompressed from
.Pa inst.fs.gz
using the provided
.Ic gzip.x
program with the
.Fl d
switch. 
See above how to write the images to floppies.
.Pp
To start the `floppy-root' installation system, insert the `kern' floppy
to your floppy drive 0, and reboot your computer with OPT.1 key pressed.
When you are prompted that `Insert file system floppy and press return.',
replace the `kern' floppy with `inst' floppy and press return key.
.Pp
Once booted, the `floppy-root' installation system is identical with
the `ramdisk-root' installation system, except that the former constantly
accesses the floppy disk.
Floppy disks are relatively unreliable media and cause some warning messages
to report access errors, most of which are corrected and can be ignored.
With the latter installation system the floppy disk is not used once the
system has booted off and can be removed from the drive.

The `floppy-root' installation system cannot be used to install
