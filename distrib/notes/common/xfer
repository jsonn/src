EISA or SCSI (i.e. ISA-only), but can be used on machines with only
4 MB of RAM.

If you are using a

The preparations for this installation/upgrade method are
easy; all you need to do is make sure that there's an FTP
site from which you can retrieve the
.Nx
distribution when you're about to
install or upgrade.
You need to know the numeric IP address of that site, and,
if it's not on a network directly connected to the machine
on which you're installing or upgrading
.Nx ,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the
.Nx
machine.
Finally, you need to know the numeric IP address of the
.Nx
machine itself.
If you don't have access to a functioning nameserver during
installation, the IP address of
.Sy ftp.netbsd.org
is
.Li 204.152.184.75
(as of October, 2000).

Once you have this information, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation or upgrade process.
If you're installing

If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to
the section on upgrading.

This method of installation is recommended only for those already familiar
with using

be all-encompassing.

from a device such as a removable SCSI disk or a magneto-optical disk,
the media

Place the
.Nx
distribution sets you wish to install into a
directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading
.Nx .
This will probably require modifying the
.Pa /etc/exports
file on of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
privileges on the server.)

You need to know the numeric IP address of the NFS server,

the machine on which you're installing or upgrading
.Nx ,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the

If you're making the tape on a

where
.Ar tape_device
is the name of the tape device that
describes the tape drive you're using; possibly
.Pa /dev/rst0 ,
or something similar, but it will vary from system to system.
(If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.)
In the above example,
.Ar dist_directories
are the
distribution sets' directories, for the distribution sets you
wish to place on the tape.
For instance, to put the
.Sy misc, base, No and Sy etc
distributions on tape (in
order to do the absolute minimum installation to a new disk),
you would do the following:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd \&.../NetBSD-\*V"
.Dl # Ic "cd \*M/binary"
.Dl # Ic "tar -cf" Ar tape_device Ic "misc etc kern"
.Pp
.(Note
You still need to fill in
