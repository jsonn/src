.Ss2 "Running the Sysinst Installation Program"
.Bl -enum
.It_need
.Em Introduction
.Pp
Using
.Ic sysinst ,
installing
.Nx
is a relatively easy process. You
still should read this document and have it in hand when doing the
installation process. This document tries to be a good guideline
for the installation and as such covers many details to be completed.
Do not let this discourage you, the install program is not hard
to use.
.
.if !r_pmax  \{\
.It_need
.Em Possible Tn PCMCIA Em issues
.Pp
There is a serious problem that may make installation of
.Nx
on
.Tn PCMCIA
machines difficult. This problem does not make
.Em using
.Tn PCMCIA
difficult once a machine is installed. If you do not have
.Tn PCMCIA
on your machine
.Tn ( PCMCIA
is only really used on laptop machines),
you can skip this section, and ignore the
.Dq Bq Tn PCMCIA
notes.
.Pp
This section explains how to work around the installation problem.
.Pp
The kernel keeps careful track of what interrupts
and I/O ports are in use during autoconfiguration. It then allows
the
.Tn PCMCIA
devices to pick unused interrupts and I/O ports.
Unfortunately, the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel may not detect all devices in your system. This may
be because the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel only supports the minimum set of devices to install
.Nx
on your system, or it may be that
.Nx
does not have support for the device causing the conflict.
.Pp
For example, suppose your laptop has a
soundblaster device built in; the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel has no sound support. The
.Tn PCMCIA No code might allocate your soundblaster's
.Tn IRQ No and I/O ports to
.Tn PCMCIA
devices, causing them not to work, or to lock up the system. This is
especially bad if one of the devices in question is your ethernet
card.
.Pp
This problem will impact some, but not all, users of
.Tn PCMCIA .
If this problem is affecting you, watch the
.Dq .Bq Tn PCMCIA
notes that will appear in this document.
.if r_i386 \{\
.Pp
It can be difficult to distinguish an interrupt conflict from
an I/O space conflict. There are no hard-and-fast rules, but
interrupt conflicts are more likely to lock up the machine,
and I/O space conflicts are more likely to result in misbehavior
(e.g. a network card that cannot send or receive packets).
.Pp
The kernel selects a free interrupt according to a mask of allowable
interrupts, stored in the kernel global variable
.Va pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask .
This mask is a logical-or of power-of-2s of allowable interrupts:
.Bd -literal -offset 04n
.Em "IRQ Val      IRQ Val      IRQ Val       IRQ Val"
 0  0x0001    4  0x0010    8  0x0100    12  0x1000
 1  0x0002    5  0x0020    9  0x0200    13  0x2000
 2  0x0004    6  0x0040   10  0x0400    14  0x4000
 3  0x0008    7  0x0080   11  0x0800    15  0x8000
.Ed
.Pp
For example, 0x0a00 allows both irq 9 and irq 11. By default,
the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel permits all IRQs other than 3, 5, and 10, so the corresponding
mask is 0xfb5f. The
.Tn Li GENERIC
kernel, however, permits IRQs other than 3 and 5 (the presumption here
is that IRQ 10 may be assigned to a device that the
.Tn Li GENERIC
kernel
supports, but that the
.Tn Li INSTALL
does not).
.Pp
The kernel selects IO space by assigning cards io space within a
predefined range.  The range is specified as a base and size,
specified by the kernel global variables
.Va pcic_isa_alloc_iobase
and
.Va pcic_isa_alloc_iosize .
For systems with 12-bit addressing (most), the kernel defaults to a
base of 0x400 and a size of 0xbff (a range of 0x400-0xfff).
For systems with 10-bit addressing, the kernel defaults to a
base of 0x300 and a size of 0xff (range of 0x300-0x3ff).
.Pp
Unfortunately, these ranges may conflict with some devices. In the
event of a conflict, try a base of 0x330 with a size of 0x0bf (range
of 0x330-0x3ff).
.Pp
In order to work around this at installation time, you may
boot the
.Tn Li INSTALL
kernel with
.Ic boot Fl d ,
in order to enter
.Xr ddb 4
(the in-kernel debugger), and then use the
.Ic write
command to alter the variable values:
.Bd -literal
db> write pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask 0x0a00
_pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask		0xfb5f = 0xa00
db> write pcic_isa_alloc_iobase 0x330
_pcic_isa_alloc_iobase		0x400 = 0x330
db> write pcic_isa_alloc_iosize 0x0bf
pcic_isa_alloc_iosize		0xbff = 0xbf
db> continue
.Ed
.Pp
After installation, this value can be permanently written to the kernel image
directly with:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
# cp /netbsd /netbsd.bak
# gdb --write /netbsd
(gdb) set pcic_isa_intr_alloc_mask=0x0a00
(gdb) set pcic_isa_alloc_iobase=0x330
(gdb) set pcic_isa_alloc_iosize=0x0bf
(gdb) quit
#
.Ed
.Pp
or you could specify these value when configuring your kernel, e.g.:
.Bd -literal
options PCIC_ISA_INTR_ALLOC_MASK=0x0a00
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE=0x330
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE=0x0bf
.Ed
.Pp
If you can
get your
.Tn PCMCIA
card to work using this hack, you may also ignore the
.Bq Tn PCMCIA
notes later in this document.
.Pp
We hope to provide a more elegant solution to this problem in a future
.Nx
release.

.It_need
.Em General
.Pp
The following is a walk-through of the steps you will take while
getting
.Nx
installed on your hard disk.
.Ic sysinst
is a menu driven
installation system that allows for some freedom in doing the
installation. Sometimes, questions will be asked and in many cases
the default answer will be displayed in brackets
.Pq Dq \&[\ ]
after the question. If you wish to stop the installation, you may hit Control-C
at any time, but if you do, you'll have to begin the installation
process again from scratch.
.It_need
.Em Quick install
.Pp
First, let's describe a quick install. The other sections of
this document go into the installation procedure in more
detail, but you may find that you do not need this. If you
want detailed instructions, skip to section 3. This section
describes a basic installation, using a CD-ROM install as
an example.

Boot your machine using the boot floppy. The boot loader will
start, and will print a countdown and begin booting.

If the boot loader messages do not appear in a reasonable
amount of time, you either have a bad boot floppy or a
hardware problem. Try writing the install floppy image to
a different disk, and using that.
.if r_i386 \{\
.Pp
If that doesn't work, try booting after disabling your CPU's
internal and external caches (if any). If it still doesn't
work,
.Nx
probably can't be run on your hardware. This can
probably be considered a bug, so you might want to report it.
If you do, please include as many details about your system
configuration as you can.
.\}
.Pp
It will take a while to load the kernel from the floppy,
probably around a minute or so, then, the kernel boot messages
will be displayed. This may take a little while also, as
.Nx
will be probing your system to discover which hardware devices are
installed.
.if r_i386 \{\
You may want to read the
boot messages, to notice your disk's name and geometry. Its name
will be something like
.Li sd0
or
.Li wd0
and the geometry will be
printed on a line that begins with its name. As mentioned above,
you may need your disk's geometry when creating NetBSD's partitions.
You will also need to know the name, to tell
.Ic sysinst
on which disk
to install.
.\}
The most important thing to know is that
.Li wd0
is NetBSD's name for your first IDE disk,
.Li wd1
the second, etc.
.Li sd0
is your first SCSI disk,
.Li sd1
the second, etc.
.Pp
Note that, once the system has finished booting, you need not
leave the floppy in the disk drive.
.if r_i386 \{\
Earlier version of
the
.Nx
install floppies mounted the floppy as the system's
root partition, but the new installation floppies use a
ramdisk file system and are no longer dependent on the floppy
once it has booted.
.\}

Once
.Nx
has booted and printed all the boot messages,
you will be presented with a welcome message and a main menu.
It will also include instructions for using the menus.

.Pp
If you will not use network operation during the installation,
but you do want your machine to be configured for networking once
it is installed, you should first go to the utilities menu, and select
.Ic Configure network option .
If you only want to temporarily
use networking during the installation, you can specify these
parameters later. If you are not using Domain Name Service (DNS),
you can give an empty response in reply to answers relating to
this.

.Pp
To start the installation, select the menu option to install
.Nx
from the main menu.
.Pp
The first thing is to identify the disk on which you want to
install
.Nx .
.Ic sysinst
will report a list of disks it finds
and ask you for your selection. Depending on how many disks
are found, you may get a different message. You should see
disk names like
.ie r_pmax \{\

.Ic sysinst
next tries to figure out the real and BIOS geometry
of your disk. It will present you with the values it found,
if any, and will give you a chance to change them.

.Pp
Next, depending on whether you are using a
.Li Pf wd Em x
or
.Li Pf wd Em x
disk,
you will either be asked for the type of disk
.Pq Li Pf wd Em x
you are
using or you will be asked if you want to specify a fake geometry
for your SCSI disk
.Pq Li Pf sd Em x .
The types of disk are be
.Tn IDE, ST-506
or
.Tn ESDI .
If you're installing on an
.Tn ST-506
or
.Tn ESDI
drive, you'll be asked if your disk supports automatic sector forwarding.
If you are

that it does, reply affirmatively. Otherwise, the install
program will automatically reserve space for bad144 tables.

You will be asked if you want to use the entire disk or

it will be checked if there are already other
systems present on the disk, and you will be asked to confirm
whether you want to overwrite these.

you can skip
the following section and go to

Editing the Master Boot Record.
.Pp
First, you will be prompted to specify the units of size
that you want to express the sizes of the partitions in.
You can either pick megabytes, cylinders or sectors.
.Pp
After this, you will be presented with the current values
stored in the MBR, and will be given the opportunity to
change, create or delete partitions. For each partition
you can set the type, the start and the size. Setting the type to
.Ic unused
will delete a partition. You can
also mark a partition as active, meaning that this is
the one that the BIOS will start from at boot time.
.Pp
Be sure to mark the partition you want to boot from as active!
.Pp
After you are done editing the MBR, a sanity check
will be done, checking for partitions that overlap.
Depending on the BIOS capabilities of your machine and the
parameters of the NetBSD partition you have specified, you
may also be asked if you want to install newer bootcode in
your MBR. If you have multiple operating systems on the
disk that you are installing on, you will also be given
the option to install a bootselector, that will allow you
to pick the operating system to start up when your computer
is (re-)started.
.Pp
If everything is ok, you can go on to the next step,
editing the
.Nx
disklabel.
.Pp
.\}
.It_need
.Em Editing the
.Nx
.Em disklabel .
.Pp
The partition table of the
.Nx
part of a disk is called a
.Em disklabel .
There are 3 layouts for the
.Nx
part of the disk that you can pick from:
.Ic Standard, Standard with X
and
.Ic Custom .
The first two use a set of default
values (that you can change) suitable for a normal
installation, possibly including X. The last option
lets you specify everything yourself.
.Pp
You will be presented with the current layout of the
.Nx
disklabel, and given a chance to change it.
For each partition, you can set the type, offset and size,
block and fragment size, and the mount point. The type
that
.Nx
uses for normal file storage is called
.Sy 4.2BSD .
A swap partition has a special type called
.Sy swap .
.
.
.ie r_i386 \{\
.
.
You can also specify a partition as type
.Sy msdos .
This is useful if you share the disk with
.Tn MS-DOS
or Windows95;
.Nx
is able to access the files on these partitions.
You can use the values from the MBR for the MS-DOS part
of the disk to specify the partition of type
.Sy msdos
(you don't have to do this now, you can always re-edit
the disklabel to add this once you have installed NetBSD).
.Pp
Some partitions in the disklabel have a fixed purpose.
Partition
.Sy \&a
is always the root partition,
.Sy \&b
is the swap partition,
.Sy \&c
is the entire
.Nx
part of the disk, and
.Sy \&d
is the whole disk. Partitions
.Sy \&e-h
are available
for other use. Traditionally,
.Sy \&e
is the partition mounted on the
.Pa /usr
directory, but this is historical practice, not a fixed value.
.

.
.
.\}
.
.
.Pp
You will then be asked to name your disk's disklabel. The
default response is
.Sy mydisk .
For most purposes this will be OK.
If you choose to name it something different, make sure the name
is a single word and contains no special characters. You don't
need to remember this name.

Nothing has been
written to your disk yet, but if you confirm that you want to
install
.Nx ,
your hard drive will be modified. If you are
sure you want to proceed, enter
.Li yes
at the prompt.
.Pp
The install program will now label your disk and make the file
systems you specified. The filesystems will be initialized to
contain
.Nx
bootstrapping binaries and configuration files.
You will see messages on your screen from the various NetBSD
disk preparation tools that are running. There should be no
errors in this section of the installation. If there are,
restart from the beginning of the installation process.
Otherwise, you can continue the installation program
after pressing the return key.

NOTE: In previous versions of
.Nx ,
the kernel from the
install floppy was copied onto the hard drive in a special
step. In the new install system, the kernel on the floppy is
unsuited to being copied onto the hard drive. Instead, a new set,

which enables you to choose from one of the following methods
of installing the sets. Some of these methods will first
load the sets on your hard disk, others will extract the sets
directly.
.Pp
For all these methods, the first step is making the sets
available for extraction, and then do the actual installation.
The sets can be made available in a few different ways. The
following sections describe each of those methods. After
reading the one about the method you will be using, you

To be able to install using ftp, you first need to configure
your network setup, if you haven't already at the start of
the install procedure.

You will also be asked to specify the host that you want
to transfer the sets from, the directory on that host,
and the account name and password used to log into that
host using ftp. If you did not set up DNS when answering
the questions to configure networking, you will need to

format. You will be asked for a directory where the sets
should be reassembled. Then you will be prompted to insert
the floppies containing the split sets. This process
will continue until all the sets have been loaded from floppy.

.Em Installation from an unmounted filesystem
.Pp
In order to install from a local filesystem, you will
need to specify the device that the filesystem resides
on
.ie r_pmax .Pq for example Li rz1e
.el .Pq for example Li wd1e
the type of the filesystem,
and the directory on the specified filesystem where the sets are located.
.Ic sysinst
will then check if it
can indeed access the sets at that location.
.It_need
.Em Installation from a local directory
.Pp
This option assumes that you have already done some preparation
yourself. The sets should be located in a directory on a
filesystem that is already accessible.
.Ic sysinst
will ask you
for the name of this directory.
.It_need
.Em Extracting the distribution sets
.Pp
After the install sets containing the
.Nx
distribution
have been made available, you can either extract all the
sets (a full installation), or only extract sets that
you have selected. In the latter case you will be shown the
currently selected sets, and given the opportunity to select
the sets you want. Some sets always need to be installed
.Pq Ic kern, base No and Ic etc
they will not be shown in this selection menu.
.Pp
Before extraction begins, you can elect to watch the files being
extracted; the name of each file that is extracted will be shown.
This can slow down the installation process considerably, especially
on machines with slow graphics consoles or serial consoles.
.Pp
After all the files have been extracted, all the necessary
device node files will be created. If you have already
configured networking, you will be asked if you want to
use this configuration for normal operation. If so, these
values will be installed in the network configuration files.

Congratulations, you have successfully installed
.Nx \*V .
You can now reboot the machine, and boot from harddisk.
