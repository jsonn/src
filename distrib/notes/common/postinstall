Once you've got the operating system running, there are a few
things you need to do in order to bring the system into a propperly
configured state, with the most important ones described below.
.Bl -enum
.It
Configuring
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
.Pp
If you haven't done any configuration of
.Pa /etc/rc.conf ,
the system will drop you into single user mode on first reboot with the
message
.Dl /etc/rc.conf is not configured. Multiuser boot aborted.
and with the root filesystem mounted read-write. When the system
asks you to choose a shell, simply hit return to get to a
prompt. If you are asked for a terminal type, respond with
.ie r_pmax \{\
the correct terminal type as discussed in the
.Sx Once you've booted the diskimage
section.
.\}
.el \{\
.Ic vt220
(or whatever is appropriate for your terminal type)
.\}
and hit return. At this point, you need to configure at least
one file in the
.Pa /etc No directory. Change to the
.Pa /etc
directory and take a look at the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file. Modify it to your tastes, making sure that you set
.Li rc_configured=YES
so that your changes will be enabled and a multi-user boot can
proceed. If your
.Pa /usr No directory is on a separate partition
and you do not know how to use 'ed' or 'ex', you will have to mount your
.Pa /usr
partition to gain access to 'vi'. Do the following:
.ie r_pmax \{\
.D1 Ic "mount /usr
.D1 Ic "export TERM=termtype
.\}
.el \{\
.D1 Ic "mount /usr
.D1 Ic "export TERM=vt220
.\}
If you have
.Pa /var
on a seperate partition, you need to repeat
that step for it. After that, you can edit
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
with
.Xr vi 1 .
When you have finished, type
.Ic exit
at the prompt to
leave the single-user shell and continue with the multi-user boot.
.Pp
Other values that need to be set in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
for a networked environment are
.Ar hostname No and possibly
.Ar defaultroute ,
furthermore add an
.Ar ifconfig_int
for your interface
.Aq int ,
along the lines of
.ie r_pmax .Dl ifconfig_le0="inet 123.45.67.89 netmask 255.255.255.0"
.el .Dl ifconfig_de0="inet 123.45.67.89 netmask 255.255.255.0"
or, if you have
.Ar myname.my.dom No in Pa /etc/hosts :
.ie r_pmax .Dl ifconfig_le0="inet myname.my.dom netmask 255.255.255.0"
.el .Dl ifconfig_de0="inet myname.my.dom netmask 255.255.255.0"
To enable proper hostname resolution, you will also want to add an
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
file or (if you are feeling a little more adventurous) run
.Xr named 8 .
See
.Xr resolv.conf 5
or
.Xr named 8
for more information.
.Pp
Other files in
.Pa /etc
that are new to NetBSD 1.4 and may require modification or
setting up include
.Pa /etc/mailer.conf ,
.Pa /etc/nsswitch.conf
and
.Pa /etc/wscons.conf .
.It
Logging in
.Pp
After reboot, you can log in as
.Li root
at the login prompt. There
is no initial password, but if you're using the machine in a
networked environment, you should create an account for yourself
(see below) and protect it and the "root" account with good
passwords.
.It
Adding accounts
.Pp
Use the
.Xr vipw 8
command to add accounts to your system,
.Em do not No edit Pa /etc/passwd
directly. See
.Xr adduser 8
for more information on the process of how to add a new user to the system.
.It
The X Window System
.Pp
If you have installed the X window system, look at the files in
.Pa /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc
for information.
.if \n[arm32]:\n[i386] \{\
.Pp
You will need to set up a configuration file, see
.Pa /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.eg
for an example.  See
.Lk http://www.xfree86.org/
and the XFree86 manual page for more information.
.\}
.Pp
Don't forget to add
.Pa /usr/X11R6/bin
to your path in your shell's dot file so that you have access to the X binaries.
.It
Installing 3rd party packages
.Pp
There is a lot of software freely available for Unix-based systems,
almost all of which can run on
.Nx .
Modifications are usually needed to
when transferring programs between different Unix-like systems, so
the
.Nx
packages collection incorporates any such
changes necessary to make that software run on
.Nx ,
and makes
the installation (and deinstallation) of the software packages
easy. There's also the option of building a package from source, in
case there's no precompiled binary available.
.Pp
Precompiled binaries can be found at
.Lk ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/
Package sources for compiling packages can be obtained by
retrieving the file
.Lk ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/pkgsrc.tar.gz
They should then be extracted into
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc
with the command:
.D1 Ic "cat pkgsrc.tar.gz | gunzip | (mkdir /usr/pkgsrc; 
.D1 Ic "cd /usr/pkgsrc; tar xpf - )
After extracting, then see
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc/README
for more information.
.It
Misc
.Bl -bullet
.It
To adjust the system to your local timezone, point the
.Pa /etc/localtime
symlink to the appropriate file under
.Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo .
.It
Edit
.Pa /etc/aliases
to forward root mail to the right place (run
.Xr newaliases 1
afterwards.)
.It
The
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cf
file will almost definitely need to be adjusted;
files aiding in this can be found in
.Pa /usr/share/sendmail .
See the
.Li Tn README
file there for more information.
.It
Edit
.Pa /etc/rc.local
to run any local daemons you use.
.It
Many of the
.Pa /etc
files are documented in section 5 of the manual; so just invoking
.D1 Ic man Ar filename
is likely to give you more information on these files.
