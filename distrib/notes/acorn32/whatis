This is the sixth major release of
.Nx
for the \*M ,
although it was known as
.Nx Ns /arm32
prior to
.Nx 1.6 .
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx
\*M binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
