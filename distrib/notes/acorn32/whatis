.Nx
for the \*M ,

.Nx Ns /arm32
prior to
.Nx 1.6 .

.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx
\*M binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs

kernel configuration.

New port-specific features include:
.(bullet
Addition of Xarm32VIDC Xserver for RiscPC and ARM7500 based systems.
