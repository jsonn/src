runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors. Support
for MCA systems (such as some
.Tn IBM
PS/2 systems) is present, but
still very experimental and needs special setup. The
minimal configuration is said to require 4 MB of RAM and 50 MB of disk
space, though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite
this minimal today. To install the entire system requires much more
disk space (the unpacked binary distribution, without sources,
requires at least 65 MB without counting space needed for swap space,
etc), and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
(4 MB of RAM will actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it
won't be speedy. Note that until you have around 16 MB of RAM, getting
more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.)

Drivers are

present in kernels on the distribution floppies.
Except as noted above, all drivers are present
on all disks.  Also, at the present time, the distributed kernels
support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
.Nx
normally
allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you can use all of
them by compiling a custom kernel once
.Nx
is installed.

kernels,
although it is not in the kernels which are on the distribution floppies.
.It [b]
Devices require BIOS support for PCI-PCI bridging on your motherboard.
Most reasonably modern Pentium motherboards have this support,
or can acquire it via a BIOS upgrade.
.It [m]
Devices are also supported by MCA-enabled kernels, such as one compiled from the
.Li PS2
configuration file.
Support for MCA is
