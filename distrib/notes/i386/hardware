NetBSD/i386 1.1 runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The
minimal configuration is said to require 4M of RAM and 50M of disk space,
though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite this minimal today.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will
actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it won't be speedy.
Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.)

Supported devices include:
	Floppy controllers.
	MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
	SCSI host adapters:
			[Adaptec host adapters only on kcadp floppy]
		Adaptec AHA-154xA, -B, -C, and -CF 
		Adaptec AHA-174x
		Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 based boards, including
			the Adaptec AHA-152x and the SoundBlaster SCSI
			host adapter.  (Note that you cannot boot from
			these boards if they do not have a boot ROM;
			only the AHA-152x and motherboards using this chip
			are likely to be bootable, consequently.)
		Adaptec AHA-294x[W] cards and some onboard PCI designs using
			the AIC7870 chip.  This driver does *not* currently
			work with non-PCI AIC-7xxx boards or the Adaptec 3940.
		Buslogic 54x (Adaptec AHA-154x clones; driver on kcadp floppy)

			[Other host adapters only on kcoth floppy]
		BusLogic 445, 74x, 9xx  (But not the new "FlashPoint" series
			of BusLogic SCSI adapters)
		Symbios Logic (NCR) 53C8xx-based PCI SCSI host adapters
		Ultrastor 14f, 34f, and (possibly) 24f
		Seagate/Future Domain ISA SCSI adapter cards, including
			ST01/02
			Future Domain TMC-885
			Future Domain TMC-950

	MDA, CGA, VGA, SVGA, and HGC Display Adapters.  (Note that not
		all of the display adapters NetBSD/i386 can work with
		are supported by X.  See the XFree86 FAQ for more
		information.)

	Miscellaneous:

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT included on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all other drivers are
present on both kernel-copy disks.  Also, at the present time, the
distributed kernels support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
NetBSD normally allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you
can use all of them by compiling a custom kernel once NetBSD is
installed.

Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernels which are on the distribution floppies.


Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	Adaptec AIC-7770-based SCSI host adapters (including the
		Adaptec AHA-274x, AHA-284x families).
	NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
	APM power management -- if your system supports it, turn it off!
	PCMCIA ("PC Card") devices, including some miniature "IDE" hard disks.
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.  (Those are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller.)
	WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.
	PCI-PCI bridges and cards which include them, such as the AHA-394x
		SCSI host adapter and some DC21x4x-based multi-Ethernet cards.
	3Com 3c59x series PCI Ethernet and Fast Ethernet adapters.
	Multiprocessor Pentium and Pentium Pro systems.  (Though they should
		run fine using one processor only.)
	Intel EtherExpress 100 Fast Ethernet adapters.
	Digital DEFPA PCI FDDI adapters (support barely missed this release;
		it works in other ports, and will work in this one in the
		next release)

We are planning future support for many of these devices.
