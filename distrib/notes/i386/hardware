NetBSD/i386 1.2 runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The
minimal configuration is said to require 4M of RAM and 50M of disk space,
though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite this minimal today.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will
actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it won't be speedy.
Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.)

Supported devices include:
	Floppy controllers.
	MFM, ESDI, IDE, and RLL hard disk controllers.
	SCSI host adapters:
			[Adaptec host adapters only on kcadp floppy]
		Adaptec AHA-154xA, -B, -C, and -CF 
		Adaptec AHA-174x
		Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 based boards, including
			the Adaptec AHA-152x and the SoundBlaster SCSI
			host adapter.  (Note that you cannot boot from
			these boards if they do not have a boot ROM;
			only the AHA-152x and motherboards using this chip
			are likely to be bootable, consequently.)
		Adaptec AHA-2x4x[U][W] cards and some onboard PCI designs
			using the AIC78X0 chip.  There is a known problem
			using this driver with AHA-2742 cards or AIC7770 or
			AIC78[56]0 based embedded designs and multiple
			targets, due to resource contention which is not
			handled well by NetBSD's higher-level SCSI subsystem.
		Adaptec AHA-3940[U][W] cards [b]
		Buslogic 54x (Adaptec AHA-154x clones; driver on kcadp floppy)

			[Other host adapters only on kcoth floppy]
		BusLogic 445, 74x, 9xx  (But not the new "FlashPoint" series
			of BusLogic SCSI adapters)
                Seagate/Future Domain ISA SCSI adapter cards, including
                        ST01/02
                        Future Domain TMC-885
                        Future Domain TMC-950
		Symbios Logic (NCR) 53C8xx-based PCI SCSI host adapters:
			Acculogic PCIpport
			ASUS SC-200 (requires NCR BIOS on motherboard)
			ASUS SP3[G] motherboard onboard SCSI
			DEC Celebris XL/590 onboard SCSI
			Lomas Data SCSI adapters
			NCR/SYM 8125 (and its many clones; be careful, some
				      of these cards have a jumper to set
				      the PCI interrupt; leave it on INT A!)
			Promise DC540 (a particularly common OEM model of
				       the SYM 8125)
			Tyan Yorktown
		Ultrastor 14f, 34f, and (possibly) 24f

	Miscellaneous:

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT included on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all other drivers are
present on both kernel-copy disks.  Also, at the present time, the
distributed kernels support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
NetBSD normally allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you
can use all of them by compiling a custom kernel once NetBSD is
installed.


Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernels which are on the distribution floppies.

Support for devices marked with "[b]" requires BIOS support for PCI-PCI
bridging on your motherboard.  Most reasonably modern Pentium motherboards
have this support, or can acquire it via a BIOS upgrade.

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	AMD PCscsi SCSI host adapters (though the PCnet portion of the
				       PCnet-SCSI works fine)
	APM power management -- if your system supports it, turn it off!
        Intel EtherExpress 100 Fast Ethernet adapters.
        Multiprocessor Pentium and Pentium Pro systems.  (Though they should
                run fine using one processor only.)
        NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
	PCI WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.
	PCMCIA ("PC Card") devices, including some miniature "IDE" hard disks.
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.  (Those are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller.)

We are planning future support for many of these devices.

To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows:
