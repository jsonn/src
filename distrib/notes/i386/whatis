For the i386, NetBSD 1.2 brings a number of new device drivers, many
bug fixes, improvements in Linux emulation (including support for sound)
and the other emulations (SVR4, IBCS2, FreeBSD), and enhancements to
a number of existing device drivers such as the "ahc" driver for Adaptec
AHC-2X4X and AIC-7XXX-based SCSI host adapters and the "bt" driver for Bus
Logic SCSI host adapters.  Support for PCI-PCI bridges allows the use of cards
such as Cogent and SMC multiple-port Ethernet cards and Adaptec 3940
multichannel SCSI host adapters with preexisting device drivers.

FDDI is now supported; drivers are in the generic (but not install) kernels.

NetBSD 1.2 on i386 is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
NetBSD i386 binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs.
