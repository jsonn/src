As is usual between releases, the \*M port has had many improvements
made to it\(emtoo many to detail all of them here.
.Pp
Numerous new drivers have been added.
See the supported hardware list for details.

Some (but not all!) notable \*M-specific improvements include:

.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M

provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
