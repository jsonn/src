This is the twelfth major release of
.Nx
for the \*M.
.Pp
As is usual between releases, the \*M port has had many improvements
made to it \(em too many to detail all of them here.
.Pp
Numerous new drivers have been added.
See the supported hardware list for details.
.Pp
Some (but not all!) notable \*M-specific improvements include:
.(bullet
Default kernels now have ACPI enabled by default. If this causes problems
on your hardware, use userconf and
.Ic disable acpi
to boot without ACPI support.
You can also boot a legacy kernel from cdrom using:
.Ic boot Ar nbnoacpi ,
and choose to install the GENERIC.NOACPI kernel set from sysinst.
.bullet)
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
