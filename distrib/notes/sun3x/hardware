NetBSD/sun3x _VER runs on most Sun3x machines, including:
	3/80
	3/460/470/480

NetBSD/sun3x _VER does not run on the Sun3 class of machines.
For NetBSD support for any other Sun3 machine, see the NetBSD/sun3
distribution.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and about 80MB of disk
space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space
(approx. 100MB additional space is necessary for full sources).
To run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  Good
performance requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB when running the
X Window System.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
	user (/usr)	95M	125M	75M 	105M
	swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/usr/local)	up to you

As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is large
and bulky to accommodate all people).

Note that the sun3x installation procedure uses a `miniroot' image
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.  The swap partition
must be at least as large as the miniroot image (8MB).

The following Sun3x hardware is supported:

	Serial ports (RS232):
		built-in ttya, ttyb

	Video adapters:
		bwtwo

	Network interfaces:
		On-board Lance Ethernet
		On-board or VME Intel Ethernet

	SCSI:  (Most SCSI disks, tapes, CD-ROMs, etc.)
		On-board "esp" (SCSI-3)
		VME "si" (SCSI-3) board

	Floppy:
		On-board floppy drive controller and floppy drive.

	Input devices:
		Sun keyboard and mouse

	Miscellaneous:
		Battery-backed real-time clock.

If it's not on this list, there is no support for it in this release.
