There's no particular preparation necessary before installing NetBSD
on your Alpha, except to make sure that if you have any data on
your disks that you want to keep, you should back it up before
starting. Note that NetBSD/alpha does not support having more than
one operating system on a single disk, although it's fine to have
multiple operating systems on your machine if you have a separate
disk for NetBSD.
