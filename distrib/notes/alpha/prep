If you have any data on your disks that you want to keep,
.Em back it up
before starting. Note that
.Nx*M
does not support booting more than
one operating system from a single disk, although it's fine to have
multiple operating systems on your machine if you have a separate
disk for
.Nx ,
or if one of them uses a network boot.
