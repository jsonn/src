There have been many, many Alpha-specific enchancements since the
1.3 release. These include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Many new system types are supported:
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
EB66 Evaluation Board
.It
ALPHABook 1
.It
Digital AlphaServer 4100 systems
.It
Digital AlphaServer 1000 systems
.It
Digital AlphaServer 1000A systems
.It
Digital AlphaServer 800 systems
.It
Digital Server 330x systems
.El
.It
Jason Thorpe's new virtual memory code provides
full support for the alpha's large address space with context switching
and translation buffer state optimizations.
.It
Extensive scheduler work enables process nice levels to work as expected,
fixing ancient BSD scheduler bugs that affected NetBSD/alpha more than
other ports with slower clock Hz defaults. Nice +19 and +20 processes
now take no time away from nice +0 programs regardless of load average.
.It
Many new device drivers and sound cards are supported. Floppy
disk drives are now supported.
.It
IDE peripheral devices are now supported on Multia and AXPPCI33 systems.
.It
A new multi-volume boot loader allows all supported system types
and device drivers to be present on floppy disk media, and enables the
.Em sysinst
screen-menu installation program to be included on
floppy disks as well. Although two floppies are now used, they load
much faster than the single floppy did in 1.3.
.It
Installation from CD and magnetic tape media is now supported.
.It
A new set of boot programs provides considerable operational and
performance enhancement.
.El
.Pp
NetBSD \*V on alpha is, as usual, also fully backward compatible
with old NetBSD/alpha binaries, so you don't need to recompile all
your local programs.
