.so ../common/upgrade
.Pp
Upgrading procedure using the
.Ic script
installer is much more complicated than that with
.Ic sysinst
installer.  When the installer comes up,
you will be presented with a welcome message and a prompt
asking whether you are going to
.Ic install
.Nx
or
.Ic upgrade
an exisiting system.  Select
.Ic upgrade
to start.
.Pp
.(enum
You will be presented with some information about the upgrade
process and a warning message, and will be asked if you wish
to proceed with the upgrade process.  If you answer
negatively, the upgrade process will stop, and your disk will
not be modified.  If you answer affirmatively, the upgrade
process will begin, and your disk will be modified.  You may press
.Key CONTROL-C
to stop the upgrade process at any time.
However, if you press it at an inopportune moment, your system
may be left in an inconsistent (and possibly unusable) state.
.It
You will be asked if you wish to upgrade your file systems to
the new file system format.  If you do, reply affirmatively.
If you don't have your file systems upgraded now, you should
probably do it manually after the install process is complete,
by using
.Ic "fsck -c 2" .
Read the
.Xr fsck 8
manual page for more
details. Note that this step is only important when upgrading
from a pre
.Nx 1.0
release.
.It
The upgrade program will then check your root file system,
and, if you approved, will upgrade it to the new file system
format.  It will then mount your root file system on
.Pa /mnt .
.It
If your file systems are being upgraded, the upgrade script
will copy the new
.Xr fsck 8
program to your hard disk and
upgrade your remaining file systems.
.It
The upgrade program will then automatically replace the boot
blocks on your disk with newer versions, and mount all of your
file systems under
.pa /mnt .
(In other words, your
.Pa /
(root) partition will be mounted on
.Pa /mnt ,
your
.Pa /usr
partition on
.Pa /mnt/usr ,
etc.)
.It
If you don't already have the
.Nx
distribution sets on your
disk, look in the installation section for information on how
to transfer them to your disk.
.It
If you don't have the disk space to copy all of the
distribution onto the hard drive, you can
install a kernel on the hard drive as detailed a few
paragraphs below, then boot off the hard drive.  Now
you can copy and install distribution sets
incrementally from your lone floppy drive.
.Pp
Once the distribution sets are transferred to your disk,
continue here.  (Obviously, if the
.Nx
distribution sets
are already on your disk, because you've transferred them
before starting the upgrade process, you don't need to
transfer them again now!)
.It
After the software has been transferred to the machine (or
mounted, in the case of upgrading via NFS or CD-ROM), change
into the directory containing the
.Pa base.tgz
distribution set.
Once you are there, run the
.Ic Set_tmp_dir
command, and press
.Key return
at the prompt to select the default answer for the
temporary directory's path name.  (It should be the path name
of the directory that you're in.)
.It
Run the command
.Ic "Extract kern"
to upgrade the kernel.
.It
Run the command
.Ic "Extract base"
to upgrade the base distribution.
.It
Repeat the above two steps for all of the sets you wish to
upgrade.  (For each, change into the directory containing the
set, run
.Ic Set_tmp_dir
and accept the default path name, then
run the
.Ic "Extract <setname>"
command.)
.It
If you were previously using the security distribution set, you
.Em must
upgrade to the new version, or you will not be able
to log in when the upgrade process is complete.  Similarly, if
you were not previously using the security set, you must
.Em not
upgrade to the new version.
.It
When you are done upgrading all of the distribution sets you
wish to upgrade, issue the command
.Ic Cleanup .
It will clean
up the installation, by remaking some system databases.  When
it is complete, all you have to do is to
.Xr reboot 8
your system.
.enum)
.Pp
.Em Your system has now been upgraded to
.Nx \*V .
.Pp
After a new kernel has been copied to your hard disk, your
machine is a complete
.Nx
\*V system.  However, that
doesn't mean that you're finished with the upgrade process.
There are several things that you should do, or might have to
do, to insure that the system works properly.
.Pp
First, if you did not upgrade your file systems to the new
file system format during the upgrade process, and you are
upgrading from a pre
.Nx 1.0,
you may want to do so now,
with
.Ic "fsck -c 2" .
If you are unsure about the process, it's
suggested that you read the
.Xr fsck 8
manual page.
.Pp
Second, you will probably want to get the etc distribution,
extract it, and compare its contents with those in your
.Pa /etc
directory.  You will probably want to replace some of your
system configuration files, or incorporate some of the changes
in the new versions into yours.
.Pp
Third, you will probably want to update the set of device
nodes you have in
.Pa /dev .
If you've changed the contents of
.Pa /dev
by hand, you will need to be careful about this, but if not, you can just
.Ic cd
into
.Pa /dev ,
and run the command
.Ic "sh MAKEDEV all" .
.Pp
Fourth, you must deal with certain changes in the formats of
some of the configuration files.  The most notable change is
that the
.Sq options
given to many of the file systems in
.Pa /etc/fstab
or by hand have changed, and some of the file systems have changed names.
.Em Important: any instances of
.Sy ufs
.Em in
.Pa /etc/fstab
.Em must be changed to
.Sy ffs .
To find out what the
new options are, it's suggested that you read the manual page
for the file system's mount commands, for example
.Xr mount_nfs 8
for NFS.
.(Note
The information for mounts of type
.Em ffs ,
i.e. Fast File System, is contained in the
.Xr mount 8
man page.
.Note)
.Pp
Finally, you will want to delete old binaries that were part
of the version of
.Nx
that you upgraded from and have since
been removed from the
.Nx
distribution.  If you are
upgrading from a pre
.Nx 1.0,
you might also
want to recompile any locally-built binaries, to take
advantage of the shared libraries.  (Note that any new
binaries that you build will be dynamically linked, and
therefore take advantage of the shared libraries, by default.
For information on how to make statically linked binaries,
see the
.Xr cc 1
and
.Xr ld 1
manual pages.)
