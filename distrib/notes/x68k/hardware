NetBSD/x68k _VER runs on the Sharp X68030 series PCs with TRUE
MC68030 MPU (not MC68EC030) and FPU.  Since the processor of
the X68030 series is MC68EC030, you need to replace it with
MC68030 (Simply remove the old chip and put the new one instead.
instead.  The largest difficulty might be to open your X68030).

In addition, some accelerators are supported:

   Xellent30 series
   040turbo
   Jupiter-X (040 / 060)
   060turbo

This means all models of X680x0 series PC except for CZ-600C
and CZ-674C, by using the appropriate accelerator, can run NetBSD!!
Note that the processor of Xellent30 series is MC68EC030, so
you need to replace your processor as well as for X68030.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and about 80M of
disk space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space,
and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
	user (/usr)	95M	125M	75M 	105M
	swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/local)	up to you

As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (ALL is
large and bulky to accommodate all people).

Supported devices include:
    - Sharp genuine SCSI interface (builtin / optional)
	* SCSI harddisks, CD-ROM drives, tape drives, scanners,...
    - Mankai Seisakusho Mach-2 SCSI interface
    - The builtin floppy drives
    - The builtin frame buffer (both of the text and graphics screen)
    - The builtin serial (RS-232C)
    - The builtin parallel (Centronics printer interface)
    - The standard keyboard
    - The mouse / trackball
    - NS16550 serial
    - Neptune-X ethernet

Hopefully, the AD-PCM sound device will be supported on the next
release.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Xellent users *MUST* change the address map setting
for it from the default ($ECC000 - $ECFFFF) before installation.  This
is because the default address conflicts with the Neptune-X ethernet
interface, and the Neptune driver is confused by it.  All the settings
other than the default are ok.  Once you installed NetBSD, and configured
your own kernel, you can restore the setting.
