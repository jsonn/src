\*V runs on the Sharp X68030 series PCs with a
.Em true
MC68030 MPU (not the original MC68EC030).  Since the processor of
the X68030 series is the MC68EC030, you need to replace it with an
MC68030. Simply remove the old chip and put in the new one instead.
The largest difficulty might be to open your X68030.
.Pp
In addition, some accelerators are supported:

.It

.bullet)
.Pp
Note that the processor for the Xellent30 series is MC68EC030, so
you need to replace your processor as well as for X68030.  040Excel
is reported
.Em not
to work at all; possibly because MC68LC040 support is
incomplete.
.Pp
For 68030 systems, installing MC68881 or MC68882 FPCP is highly recommended
but not required.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4 MB of RAM and about 100 MB of
disk space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space,
and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
.Pp
Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bl -column -offset indent Partition Suggested 100xMBxx Needed 100xMB

Anything else is up to you!

.Pp
As you may note the recommended size of
.Pa /usr
is 100 MB greater than needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and
compile tree as you will probably want to compile your own kernel.
.Li ( ALL
is large and bulky to accommodate all people).

Supported devices include:

Hopefully, the AD-PCM sound device will be supported in the future releases.
