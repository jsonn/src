NOTE: Currently NetBSD/x68k requires a dedicated disk when you install
it for the first time.  In other words NetBSD/x68k cannot be installed
on the hard disk on which Human68k or any other operating systems
reside.  This is because of the poor installer, and the system itself
can share a single disk with other OSs.  This problem should be fixed
in the next release.

What you have to do to prepare the disk is only to physically format
your hard disk by using FORMAT.x utility of Human68k to install the
master boot program on your disk.  You can now proceed with the
installation instructions.
