.
.(Note
Currently
.Nx*M
requires a dedicated disk when you install
it for the first time.
In other words
.Nx*M
cannot be installed
on the hard disk on which
.Tn Human68k
or any other operating systems reside.
This is because of the poor installer, and the system itself
can share a single disk with other OSs.
.Note)
.Pp
What you have to do to prepare the disk is only to physically format
your hard disk by using FORMAT.x utility of
.Tn Human68k
to install the master boot program on your disk.
If you are not planning to use the disk from
.Tn Human68k ,
this step is optional.
.Pp
You can now proceed with the installation instructions.
