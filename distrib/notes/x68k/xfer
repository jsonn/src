Installation is supported from several media types, including:

.It
Removable SCSI hard disk, or Magneto-Optical disk (MO)
.It
Tape
.It
Remote NFS partition
.It
FTP
.El
.Pp
You'll need to have a install floppy disk. On the first, you'll put
the install floppy image.
.Pp
If you are using a UN*X-like system to write the floppy images to
disks, you should use the 
.Pa dd
command to copy the file system images (.fs files) directly to the raw
floppy disks. It is suggested that you read the dd(1) manual page or
ask your system administrator to determine the correct set of
arguments to use; it will be slightly different from system to system,
and a comprehensive list of the possibilities is beyond the scope of
this document.
.Pp
If you are using Human68k to write the floppy images to disks, you
should use the
.Pa rawrite
utility, provided in the
.Pa installation/misc
directory of the NetBSD distribution. It will write the file system
images (.fs files) to disks.
.Pp
If you can retrieve
.Pa loadbsd.x
utility and
.Pa netbsd.INSTALL
file which can be found in
.Pa installation/misc
directory into your Human68k disk, you can run installation kernel
without preparing the special boot floppy.  Simply type:
.D1 Ic loadbsd netbsd.INSTALL
from the Human68k command line, then
.Nx
will start the installation sequence.
.Pp
Obviously, the steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for
installation or upgrade depend on which installation medium you
choose. The steps for the various media are outlined below.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Em Install\ From\ Removable\ SCSI\ Hard\ Disk\ or\ MO
.Pp
To install NetBSD from a removable device
the media
.Em must
be of the IBM
.Em Super-floppy
format. The Human68k format is not recognized
by this release of the NetBSD/\*m. If you have a MS-DOS (or
MS-Windows) machine with an MO drive connected, use it. If
you don't, and if you have a program to handle IBM format MO
for Human68k, copy all the files in the subdirectory
.Pa x68k/binaries
and CHANGE THEIR NAMES IN UPPER CASE.
.
.It Em Install\ From\ Tape
.Pp
To install or upgrade NetBSD using a tape, you need to do the
following:
.Pp
To install NetBSD from a tape, you need to make a tape that
contains the distribution set files, in "tar" format. If
you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
to do so is probably something like:
.D1 Ic tar\ cf Ar tape_device Ar dist_directories
where
.Ar tape_device
is the name of the tape device that
describes the tape drive you're using (possibly /dev/rst0, or
something similar, but it will vary from system to system.
(If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.)
In the above example,
.Ar dist_directories
are the
distribution sets' directories, for the distribution sets you
wish to place on the tape. For instance, to put the
.Sy base No and Sy etc
distributions on tape (in order to do the absolute
minimum installation to a new disk), you would do the
following:
.D1 Ic cd .../NetBSD-\*V # the top of the tree
.D1 Ic cd x68k/binary/sets
.D1 Ic tar\ cf Ar tape_device Ic base.tgz\ etc.tgz
(Note that you still need to fill in
.Ar tape_device
in the example.)
.Pp
Once you have the files on the tape, you can proceed to the
next step in the installation or upgrade process. If you're
installing NetBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing
your hard disk, below. If you're upgrading an existing
installation, go directly to the section on upgrading.
.It Em Install\ From\ Remote\ NFS\ Partition
.Pp
To install or upgrade NetBSD using a remote partition, mounted via
NFS, you must do the following:
.(Note
This method of installation is recommended only for
those already familiar with using BSD network
configuration and management commands. If you aren't,
this documentation should help, but is not intended to
be all-encompassing.
.Note)
.Pp
Place the NetBSD distribution sets you wish to install into a
directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading NetBSD.
This will probably require modifying the /etc/exports file on
of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
privileges on the server.)
.Pp
You need to know the the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
and, if the server is not on a network directly connected to
the machine on which you're installing or upgrading NetBSD,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the NetBSD machine. Finally, you need to know the numeric
IP address of the NetBSD machine itself.
.Pp
Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
in the installation or upgrade process. If you're installing
NetBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard
disk, below. If you're upgrading an existing installation, go
directly to the section on upgrading.
.Pp
.It Em Install\ via\ FTP
.Pp
To install or upgrade NetBSD by using FTP to get the installation
sets, you must do the following:
.(Note
This method of installation is recommended only for
those already familiar with using BSD network
configuration and management commands. If you aren't,
this documentation should help, but is not intended to
be all-encompassing.
.Note)
.Pp
The preparations for this installation/upgrade method are
easy; all you make sure that there's some FTP site from which
you can retrieve the NetBSD distribution when you're about to
install or upgrade. You need to know the numeric IP address
of that site, and, if it's not on a network directly connected
to the machine on which you're installing or upgrading NetBSD,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the NetBSD machine. Finally, you need to know the numeric
IP address of the NetBSD machine itself.
.Pp
Once you have this information, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation or upgrade process. If you're
installing NetBSD from scratch, go to the section on
preparing your hard disk, below. If you're upgrading an
existing installation, go directly to the section on
upgrading.
.El
.Pp
If you are upgrading NetBSD, you also have the option of installing
NetBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there. To do that, you must do the
following:
.Bl -enum
.It
Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
your current file system tree. At a bare minimum, you must
upgrade the "base" binary distribution, and so must put the
"base.tgz" set somewhere in your file system. If you wish,
you can do the other sets, as well, but you should NOT upgrade
the "etc" distribution; the "etc" distribution contains system
configuration files that you should review and update by hand.
.It
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.
