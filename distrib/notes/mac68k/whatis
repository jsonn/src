NetBSD _VER is the fourth "real" release of NetBSD for the 68k-based
Macintosh.

For the mac68k port, NetBSD _VER brings a number of improvements:

    -  A host of new drivers and kernel changes enable support for
       many 68040-based Macintosh systems.

    -  Many previously unsupported 68030-based Macintoshes are now working.

    -  Support for SONIC (DP83932) and MACE (Am79C940) Ethernet controllers
       has been added (via the "sn" and "mc" devices).

    -  The "ae" driver for DP8390-based Ethernet cards now handles more
       NuBus ethernet cards.

    -  The "grf" video driver supports many more NuBus video cards and
       most onboard video configurations.

    -  The serial driver code has been converted to use the machine
       independent driver.  This change enables the use of cdtrcts flow
       control, but support for externally clocked serial ports is still
       incomplete.

    -  The "adb" driver now supports the ADB hardware on most Mac models,
       and a wider variety of third party mice and trackballs are handled
       as well.

There is still a lot of work to be done and help is welcomed.  Please jump
in!

NetBSD _VER on mac68k is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with
old NetBSD mac68k binaries, so you don't need to recompile all of your
local programs.
