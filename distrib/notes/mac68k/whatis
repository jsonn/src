NetBSD _VER is the fourth "real" release of NetBSD for the 68k-based
Macintosh.

For the mac68k port, NetBSD _VER brings a number of number of
improvements, including a host of new drivers and kernel changes
enabling support for many 68040-based Macintosh systems.  In addition, many
previously unsupported 68030-based Macintoshes are now working.  Support
for SONIC and MACE ethernet controllers has been added (via the "sn" and
"mc" devices), and numerous enhancements to a number of existing drivers
such as the "ae" driver for DP8390-based ethernet cards and "grf" video
driver have been made as well.

There is still a lot of work to be done and help is welcomed.  Please jump
in!

NetBSD _VER on mac68k is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with
old NetBSD mac68k binaries, so you don't need to recompile all of your
local programs.
