NetBSD 1.0 is the first "real" release of NetBSD for the mac68k.
Previous releases have been alpha or beta quality.  There is still a
lot of work to be done, but this should be a usable system for a number
of people.  Quite a few features are available: shared libraries, new
file systems, binary compatibility with the other m68k ports for most
binaries, SunOS compatibility, and numerous others.
