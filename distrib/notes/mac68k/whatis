.Nx \*V
is the seventh major release of
.Nx
for the \*A-based Macintosh.
.Pp
For the \*M port,
.Nx \*V
offers improved support for a variety of PowerBook models, many of which
now support the built-in keyboard and display as a console. Please see the
.Sx NetBSD/\*M\ System\ Requirements\ and\ Supported\ Devices
section for details.
.Pp
There is still a lot of work to be done and help is welcomed.
.Nx \*V
on the \*M platform is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all of your local programs.
