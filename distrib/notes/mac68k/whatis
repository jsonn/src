.It
Support for 800KB floppy drives has been added (i.e. machines that
include the IWM or SWIM, but not the SWIM II or SWIM III)

There is still a lot of work to be done and help is welcomed. Please jump in!
.Nx \*V
on mac68k is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx
mac68k binaries, so you don't need to recompile all of your local programs.
