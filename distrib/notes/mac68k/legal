	Takashi Hamada and John Wittkoski beating the direct ADB hardware
		driver into submission.

		AV Macs. 
	Scott Jann for acquiring a IIx and a IIci, used for building and
		testing release sets.

	Markus Krummenacker for monetary donations.

	Bill Studenmund for providing a stable front end to the machine-
		independent serial driver.
	Schuyler Stultz for the loan of his Macintosh II when we
		desperately needed another machine on which to compile
