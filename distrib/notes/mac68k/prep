Find your favorite disk partitioning utility.  Some
of the ones that have been tried and seem to work are:
	SCSI Directory Lite
	Disk Manager Mac from OnTrack
	HD SC Setup from Apple
	I/O Formatter from Diversified (?)
	Silverlining from LaCie
	APS Disk Tools

The last can be found on any A/UX ftp site--for example:
jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov:/pub/mac/APS273.sit.hqx, or
dunkin.princeton.edu:/pub/jagubox/mac/APS273.sit.hqx.

** First, be sure you have a reliable backup of any data
** which you may want to keep.  Repartitioning your hard
** drive is an excellent way to destroy important data.

Second, use your favorite partitioning utility to make
at least an A/UX "Root & Usr" partition and an A/UX "Swap"
partition.  The "Root & Usr" partition should be _at least_
50MB in size if you wish to install everything.  Generally,
you should allocate twice as much swap space as you have real
memory (so, if you have 8MB of RAM, specify 16MB of swap space).
Systems that will be heavily used or that are low on real
memory should have more swap space allocated.  Systems that
will be only lightly used can get away with less.

If you like, you can also create a smaller root partition
and a larger /usr.  If you plan to use this machine as a
server, you may also want a separate /var.  Create these
partitions as the BSD "usr" or "User slice X" type.

You are now set to install NetBSD on your hard drive.
