Installation is currently only supported from the local Macintosh hard
drive, from a CD-ROM, or from an AppleShare volume (however, you may upgrade
a system from within
.Nx
; see the section on upgrading for more details).
If you are installing from a local hard drive, this means that you'll need
at least enough room for the largest file that you will have to install.
This is the 15.2 MB
.Pa base.tgz
file. There has been talk of allowing an install
from split files. If you have the time, desire, and knowledge, please feel
free to add that functionality.
.Pp
If the install is being done from an AppleShare-mounted volume, the install
utility must be in the same folder as the binary distribution sets.
.Pp
Each distribution file is in
.Em raw No archive format.
.(bullet
Distribution files must be downloaded in binary mode.  Common web
browsers may not be suitable for this task; FTP clients such as
Fetch and Anarchie work fine, but be sure to specify a binary file
transfer.
.It
The files should not be unpacked.  If you have the Internet Config
extension installed, you can disable this in the
.Dq "Helpers"
dialog
by removing the entry associated with
.Dq ".tgz"
files.  Other FTP
clients may require separate changes; consult your package's
documentation.
.It
If you are installing from a CD-ROM, the distribution sets are
already in the proper format and no special handling is required.

.Pp
You will also need to collect the
.Tn MacOS
installation tools from the
.Pa \*M/installation/misc No subdirectory of the
.Nx \*V
distribution:
Mkfs,
.Nx*M
Installer, and
.Nx*M
Booter. These three are
in binhexed, self-extracting archives as Mkfs.sea.hqx, Installer.sea.hqx,
and Booter.sea.hqx, respectively. Extract them as you would any other
Macintosh application.
