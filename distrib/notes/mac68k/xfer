Installation is really only supported from the local Macintosh
hard drive or from an AppleShare volume.  This means that you'll
need at least enough room for the largest file that you will have
to install.  This is the 7.2M base121 file.  There has been talk
of allowing an install from split files.  If you have the time,
desire, and knowledge, please feel free to add that functionality.

If the install is being done from an AppleShare-mounted volume,
the install utility must be in the same folder as the data files.

Each distribution file is in "raw" UN*X format, and must be
downloaded in binary mode.  Common web browsers are not suitable
for this task; FTP clients such as Fetch and Anarchie work fine,
but be sure to specify a binary file transfer.

You will also need to collect the MacOS tools:
	Mkfs,
	Installer, and
	NetBSD/mac68k Booter.

These three are compacted and in binhex form as mkfs.cpt.hqx,
Installer1.1.sea.hqx, and Booter1.9.4.sit.bin, respectively.
Extract them as you would any other Macintosh applications.  If
you need them, the sources are in the "src" subdirectory.
