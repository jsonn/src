Installation is currently only supported from the local Macintosh
hard drive or from an AppleShare volume (however, you may upgrade
a system from within NetBSD; see the section on upgrading for more
details).  This means that you'll need at least enough room for the
largest file that you will have to install.  This is the 8.6MB base13
file.  There has been talk of allowing an install from split files.
If you have the time, desire, and knowledge, please feel free to add
that functionality.

If the install is being done from an AppleShare-mounted volume, the
install utility must be in the same folder as the data files.

Each distribution file is in "raw" UN*X format, and must be
downloaded in binary mode.  Common web browsers are not suitable
for this task; FTP clients such as Fetch and Anarchie work fine,
but be sure to specify a binary file transfer.

You will also need to collect the MacOS tools from the "mac68k/utils"
subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution:
	Mkfs,
	Installer, and
	BSD/mac68k Booter.

These three are in binhexed, self-extracting archives as
Mkfs.sea.hqx, Installer.sea.hqx, and Booter.sea.hqx, respectively.
Extract them as you would any other Macintosh applications.  If you
need them, the sources for these utilities are in the "src"
subdirectory.
