Installation is currently only supported from the local Macintosh hard
drive or from an AppleShare volume (however, you may upgrade a system from
within NetBSD; see the section on upgrading for more details).  This means
that you'll need at least enough room for the largest file that you will
have to install.  This is the 8.6M base.tgz file.  There has been talk of
allowing an install from split files.  If you have the time, desire, and
knowledge, please feel free to add that functionality.

If the install is being done from an AppleShare-mounted volume, the install
utility must be in the same folder as the binary distribution sets.

Each distribution file is in "raw" archive format.

    -	Distribution files must be downloaded in binary mode.  Common web
	browsers may not be suitable for this task; FTP clients such as
	Fetch and Anarchie work fine, but be sure to specify a binary file
	transfer.

    -	The files should not be unpacked.  If you have the Internet Config
	extension installed, you can disable this in the "Helpers" dialog
	by removing the entry associated with ".tgz" files.  Other FTP
	clients may require separate changes; consult your package's
	documentation.

You will also need to collect the MacOS installation tools from the
"mac68k/installation/misc" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution:
Mkfs, NetBSD/Mac68k Installer, and NetBSD/Mac68k Booter.  These three are
in binhexed, self-extracting archives as Mkfs.sea.hqx, Installer.sea.hqx,
and Booter.sea.hqx, respectively.  Extract them as you would any other
Macintosh application.
