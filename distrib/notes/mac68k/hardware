NetBSD/mac68k _VER runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
About 4MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and the system can probably
be squeezed onto a 40MB hard disk by leaving off an unnecessary set or two.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than booting, at
least 8MB of RAM and more disk space is recommended.  About 75MB will be
necessary to install all of the NetBSD _VER binary system distribution
sets (note that this does not count swap space!).  An addition 25MB or so
is needed for the binary X11 distribution sets.  Much more disk space is
required to install the source and objects as well (about another 200-300MB
as a guess).

If your 68030 system is not listed above, it may be because of a problem
with accessing onboard video, and it may still work with a serial console.
Some of the known ones in this category:
	Classic-series Macs 
	PowerBook 100-series and Duo-series Macs

If your 68LC040 system is not listed above, it is due to a problem with
floating point emulation (FPE) for this type of processor.  Machines in
this category include:
	Newer LC-series machines
	Newer Performa-series machines
<<<<<<< 1.4

	Some PowerBook 500-series Macs

What isn't supported, but often asked about:
	Macintosh IIfx:  This machine has unusual custom chips for the
		ADB and serial interfaces which makes support for it
		difficult.  Work is in progress on this, though.
	Quadra 900/950:  These machines have I/O processor chips for their
		ADB interfaces similar to those used in the IIfx and thus
		face similar support problems.
	PowerPC-based Macs.  This will be separate from this port.
 		The PowerPC is a much different processor as is much of
		the hardware inside these machines.  If you are
		interested in this, you might want to take a look at 
		http://www.mklinux.apple.com/.  In addition, there is
		also a NetBSD-powerpc port.  For more information, please
		see http://www.tools.de/~ws/NetBSD/powerpc.html.
