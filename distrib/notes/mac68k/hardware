NetBSD/mac68k 1.0 runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
4MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and the system can probably
be squeezed onto a 40MB hard disk by leaving off a package or two.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than
booting, at least 8MB of RAM and more disk space is recommended.
About 50MB will be necessary to install all of the NetBSD 1.0 binary
distribution (note that this does not count swap space!).  Much more
disk space is required to install the source and objects as well (about
another 105MB).

Supported models:
	Mac II
	Mac IIx
	Mac IIcx
	Mac IIci
	Mac SE/30

Supported devices on all of the above systems include:
	Internal SCSI bus and most SCSI tapes, hard drives, and CD-ROMs
	Internal sound--enough to beep, anyway
	Most basic NuBUS video cards (there have been some
		problems with some 24-bit color cards)
	Both internal serial ports
	ADB keyboards and mice
	
Some systems will boot and are usable from an external terminal
(serial tty or SL/IP):
	Mac IIsi
	Mac IIvx
	possibly others

What isn't supported, but often asked about:
	Ethernet cards.  There is a driver that is very close to working
		for a number of cards.  Contributions are very welcome.
	68040-based Macs.  Work is in progress on getting a Quadra 700
		running.  This requires a new scsi driver and a new
		ethernet driver.
