NetBSD/mac68k 1.2 runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
4MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and the system can probably
be squeezed onto a 40MB hard disk by leaving off a package or two.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than
booting, at least 8MB of RAM and more disk space is recommended.
About 60MB will be necessary to install all of the NetBSD 1.2 binary
distribution (note that this does not count swap space!).  Much more
disk space is required to install the source and objects as well (about
another 200-300MB as a guess).

Supported models:
	Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci, SE/30, IIsi, IIvx, IIvi,
	Performa 550, Performa 600,
	LC III, LC 520,
	MacTV

Supported devices on all of the above systems include:
	Internal SCSI bus and most SCSI tapes, hard drives, and CD-ROMs
	Internal sound--enough to beep on some machines, anyway
	Most basic NuBUS video cards (there have been some
		problems with some 24-bit color cards)
	Both internal serial ports
	ADB keyboards and mice
	Ethernet cards based on the Natl. Semiconductor 8390
		(Asante, Apple, and a few others--problems still
		 with ethernet and many NuBus video cards).
	
If your 68030 system is not listed above, it may be because of a problem
with accessing the ADB and it may still work with a serial console.
Some of the known ones in this category:
	Classic II (Performa 200?)
	PowerBook 145, PowerBook 160

What isn't supported, but often asked about:
	68040-based Macs.  Work is in progress on these, but it is slow-
		going.  This requires a new scsi driver and a new
		ethernet driver.  When something is available, it will
		be announced on port-mac68k@netbsd.org.
	PowerPC-based Macs.  This will be separate from this port.
 		The PowerPC is a much different processor as is much of
		the hardware inside these machines.  If you are
		interested in this, you might want to take a look at
