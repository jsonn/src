.\"	$NetBSD: hardware,v 1.15.8.1 2000/08/06 12:56:17 briggs Exp $	
NetBSD/mac68k \*V runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
About 4MB of RAM might be sufficient to boot, and the system can probably
be squeezed onto a 40MB hard disk by leaving off an unnecessary set or two.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than booting, at
least 8MB of RAM and more disk space is recommended. About 95MB will be
necessary to install all of the
.Nx \*V
binary system distribution
sets (note that this does not count swap space!). An additional 30MB or so
is needed for the binary X11 distribution sets. Much more disk space is
required to install the source and objects as well (at least another 300MB).

If your 68LC040 system is not listed above, it is due to a problem with

.Ss2 What\ isn't\ supported,\ but\ often\ asked\ about:
.Bl -hang
.It Em Macintosh IIfx:
This machine has unusual custom chips for the
ADB and serial interfaces which make support for it
difficult. Work is in progress on this, though.
.It Em Quadra 900/950:
These machines have I/O processor chips for their
ADB interfaces similar to those used in the IIfx and thus
face similar support problems.
.It Em PowerPC-based Macs:
This is a separate effort from the mac68k port. PowerMacs
use hardware that is often fairly different from that of
the mac68k port.  If you are interested in this, you might
want to take a look at the new NetBSD/macppc port:

Known hardware issues with this release:
.Bl -hang
.It Em Real Time Clock:
Due to oddities of the Macintosh hardware
interrupt priority scheme, NetBSD/mac68k keeps very poor
time. Under a high interrupt load (e.g. SCSI or serial
port activity) , a machine can lose several minutes per
hour. A consequence of this problem is that attempting to
run xntpd is rather pointless unless you periodically call
ntpdate.
.It Em SCSI difficulties:
The NetBSD/mac68k SCSI drivers are not quite as
robust as their MacOS counterparts. Symptoms of these
problems are that some SCSI disks will not work under
NetBSD that work fine under MacOS. Other problems include
occasional filesystem corruption with some types of drives
and the general unreliability of removable SCSI media.
Keep in mind that there are no clear patterns with these
problems, and they do not appear to affect the majority of
users.
