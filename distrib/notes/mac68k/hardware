NetBSD/mac68k 1.1 runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
4MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and the system can probably
be squeezed onto a 40MB hard disk by leaving off a package or two.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than
booting, at least 8MB of RAM and more disk space is recommended.
About 50MB will be necessary to install all of the NetBSD 1.1 binary
distribution (note that this does not count swap space!).  Much more
disk space is required to install the source and objects as well (about
another 105MB).

Supported models:
	Mac II, Mac IIx, Mac IIcx, Mac IIci, Mac SE/30,
	Mac IIsi, Mac IIvx, Mac IIvi, Performa 600

Supported devices on all of the above systems include:
	Internal SCSI bus and most SCSI tapes, hard drives, and CD-ROMs
	Internal sound--enough to beep on some machines, anyway
	Most basic NuBUS video cards (there have been some
		problems with some 24-bit color cards)
	Both internal serial ports
	ADB keyboards and mice
	Ethernet cards based on the Natl. Semiconductor 8390
		(Asante, Apple, and a few others)  [problems
		reported on the Performa 600, though].
	
Some systems will boot and are usable from an external terminal
(serial tty or SL/IP):
	LC III
	Performa 550
	possibly others

What isn't supported, but often asked about:
	68040-based Macs.  Work is in progress on getting a Quadra 700
		running.  This requires a new scsi driver and a new
		ethernet driver.
	PowerPC-based Macs.  Work will begin on this, sometime soon.
		It will be separate from this port, though.  The PowerPC
		is a much different processor.
