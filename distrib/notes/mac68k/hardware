.Nx*M
\*V runs on several of the older Macintosh computers.
About 4 MB of RAM might be sufficient to boot, and the system can probably
be squeezed onto a 40 MB hard disk by leaving off an unnecessary set or two.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than booting, at
least 8 MB of RAM and more disk space is recommended.
About 95 MB will be necessary to install all of the
.Nx \*V
binary system distribution
sets (note that this does not count swap space!).
An additional 30 MB or so is needed for the binary X11 distribution sets.
Much more disk space is required to install the source and objects as well
(at least another 300 MB).

Onboard SCSI bus and most SCSI tapes, hard drives, and CD-ROMs

problems with some 24-bit color cards and with most
QuickDraw acclerators)

with Ethernet and many NuBus video cards)

If your 68030 system is not listed above, it may be because of a problem
with accessing onboard video, and it may still work with a serial console.

PowerBook 100-series and Duo-series Macs

.Pp
If your 68LC040 system is not listed above, it is due to a problem with
floating point emulation (FPE) for this type of processor.

.(bullet -offset indent
Macintosh IIfx
.Pp
This machine has unusual custom chips for the ADB and serial interfaces
which make support for it difficult.
Work is in progress on this, though.
.It
Quadra 900/950
.Pp
These machines have I/O processor chips for their ADB interfaces similar to
those used in the IIfx and thus face similar support problems.
.It
PowerPC-based Macs
.Pp
This is a separate effort from the \*M port.
PowerMacs use hardware that is often fairly different from that of
the \*M port.
If you are interested in this, you might want to take a look at the new
.Nx Ns /macppc
port:

.Ss2 Known hardware issues with this release
.(bullet -offset indent
Real Time Clock
.Pp
Due to oddities of the Macintosh hardware interrupt priority scheme,
.Nx*M
keeps very poor time.
Under a high interrupt load (e.g. SCSI or serial port activity),
a machine can lose several minutes per hour.
A consequence of this problem is that attempting to run
.Ic xntpd
is rather pointless unless you periodically call
.Ic ntpdate .
.It
SCSI difficulties
.Pp
The
.Nx*M
SCSI drivers are not quite as
robust as their
.Tn MacOS
counterparts.
Symptoms of these problems are that some SCSI disks will not work under
NetBSD that work fine under
.Tn MacOS .
Other problems include
occasional file system corruption with some types of drives
and the general unreliability of removable SCSI media.
Keep in mind that there are no clear patterns with these
problems, and they do not appear to affect the majority of
users.
