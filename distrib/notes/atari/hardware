.Nx*M
\*V runs on a TT030, Falcon, Hades and MilanI. An FPU is not required.
The minimum amount of RAM required is 4 MB. On the Hades, only the Tseng PCI
VGA cards (ET4000/ET6000/ET6100) are supported in the \*V release. When
an unsupported video card is present, you can use
.Nx
with a serial console only.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bl -column -offset indent Partition Suggested 100xMBxx Needed 100xMB
.It Partition Ta Suggested Ta +\ X     Ta Needed   Ta +\ X
.It root\ (/) Ta "25 MB"   Ta "25 MB"  Ta "20 MB"  Ta "20 MB"
.It /usr      Ta "245 MB"  Ta "270 MB" Ta "120 MB" Ta "145 MB"
.It /var      Ta "20 MB"   Ta "20 MB"  Ta "5 MB"   Ta "5 MB"
.It swap      Ta Em "2*RAM below 32 MB, then up to you"
.El

Anything else is up to you!

In addition of the rule of thumb for the swap size mentioned below, you
probably want to make sure that the size of the swap partition does not
drop below 20 MB (30 MB for systems with X).
Another item is the add-on packages. You might want 20-30M (or more) in
.Pa /usr/local
(or added to
.Pa /usr )
to store packages from the
.Nx
package system.
As you may note the recommended size of
.Pa /usr
is 125 MB greater than needed.
This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel.
.Li ( GENERIC
is large and bulky to accommodate all people,
.Li BOOT
is small and might not have all the features you want).
