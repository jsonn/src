NetBSD/atari \*V runs on a TT030, Falcon and Hades. An FPU is not required.
The minimum amount of RAM required is 4Mb. On the Hades, only the Tseng PCI
VGA cards (et4000/et6000/et6100) are supported in the \*V release. When
an unsupported video card is present, you can use NetBSD with a serial console
only.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
user (/usr)	95M	125M	75M 	105M
swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
local (/local)	up to you
.Ed
In addition of the rule of thumb for the swap size mentioned below, you
probably want to make sure that the size of the swap partition does not
drop below 20Mb (30Mb for systems with X).
As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is
large and bulky to accommodate all people, BOOT is small and might
not have all the features you want).

This list is incomplete by definition. I can not test all SCSI peripherals,
ISA cards or PCI cards...
