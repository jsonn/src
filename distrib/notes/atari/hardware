.Nx*M
\*V runs on the TT030, Falcon, Hades and MilanI machines.
An FPU is not required.
The minimum amount of RAM required is 4 MB.
On the Hades, only the Tseng PCI
VGA cards (ET4000/ET6000/ET6100) are supported in the \*V release.
When an unsupported video card is present, you can use
.Nx
with a serial console only.
.Pp
A minimal installation requires around 100MB of disk space, plus a swap
partition size of 2*RAM (and always greater than 20MB).
You will probably want to compile your own kernel, as
.Li GENERIC
is large and bulky in order to accommodate all people,
.Li BOOT
is small and might not have all the features you want).
