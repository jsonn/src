NetBSD/atari _VER runs on a TT030, Falcon and Hades. An FPU is not required.
The minimum amount of RAM required is 4Mb. On the Hades, only the et4000-PCI
card is supported in the _VER release. When another video card is present,
you can use NetBSD only with a serial console.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	20M	20M	15M	15M
	user (/usr)	95M	125M	75M 	105M
	swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/local)	up to you

In addition of the rule of thumb for the swap size mentioned below, you
probably want to make sure that the size of the swap partition does not
drop below 20Mb (30Mb for systems with X).
As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is
large and bulky to accommodate all people, BOOT is small and might
not have all the features you want).

Supported devices include:

	- The builtin video controller
	- The builtin (720Kb/1.44Mb) floppydrive
	- The serial2/modem2 ports
	- The Falcon FX memory expansion
	- The atari mouse

	- ET4000-PCI (VGA) on the Hades.

If it's not on this list, there is no support for it in this release.
