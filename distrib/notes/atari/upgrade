Before updating, you probably would want to backup your original
filesystems!

The update procedure will not overwrite or remove any files not present
in the sets you install. If you've replaced programs present in the
distribution, you have to replace them again after you did the update.
The etc-set needs special caution. You generally don't want to install
this one when upgrading. It is recommended that you get a copy of this
set and _carefully_ upgrade your configuration files by hand.

    1. Starting the upgrade
    =======================
	Ok, let's go. Insert the bootfloppy and follow the 'normal'
	installation procedure until it asks you if you wish to install or
	upgrade. At this time, select upgrade.
	You will now be greeted and reminded of the fact that this is a
	potential dangerous procedure and that you should not upgrade the
	etc-set.

    2. Selecting your root disk
    ===========================
	When you decide to proceed, you will be prompted to enter
	your root disk. After you've done this, it will be checked
	automatically to make sure that the filesystem is in a sane
	state before making any modifications. After this is done,
	you will be asked if you want to configure your network. You
	can skip this section on NetBSD/Atari for now.

    3. Editing the fstab
    ====================
	You are now allowed to edit your fstab. Normally you don't have
	to. Note that the upgrade-kit uses it's own copy of the fstab.
	Whatever you do here *won't* affect your actual fstab.
	After you are satisfied with your fstab, the upgrade-kit will check
	all filesystems mentioned in it. When they're ok, they will be
	mounted.

    4. The actual upgrade
    =====================
	You will now be asked if your sets are stored on a normally
	mounted filesystem. You should answer 'y' to this question if
	you have the sets stored on a filesystem that was present in
	the fstab. The actions you should take for the set extraction
	are pretty logical (I think). You might want to read the notes
	in section 9 (Installing the distribution sets) of the
	installation section.

    5. Finishing up
    ===============
	After you have extracted the sets, the upgrade kit will proceed
	with setting the timezone and installing the kernel and bootcode.
	This is all exactly the same as described in the installation
	section.
