Before updating, you probably would want to backup your original
filesystems!

The update procedure will not overwrite or remove any files not present
in the sets you install. If you've replaced programs present in the
distribution, you have to replace them again after you did the update.
The etc-set needs special caution. You generally don't want to install
this one when upgrading. It is recommended that you get a copy of this
set and _carefully_ upgrade your configuration files by hand.
Before starting the actual procedure, make a note of the partitions your
root- and usr-filesystems are on. You'll need to mount them by hand.

Ok, let's go. Insert the bootfloppy and follow the 'normal' installation
procedure until it asks you if you wish to proceed with the installation.
Now enter 'n' and hit return. You will be left at the shell prompt. Now
mount your root and usr filesystems on /mnt. If your root-filesystem is
on sd1a and your usr-filesystem on sd1d this would require the following
actions:
	mount_ffs /dev/sd1a /mnt
	mount_ffs /dev/sd1d /mnt/usr

At this point, you can follow the section "Installing the NetBSD System"
to install the sets. There is one difference: When Extract asks you 
	"Are you installing a -current snapshot? [n]"
answer 'y'.

Once you are done installing the upgrade sets, then reboot:
	cd /
	umount -av
	halt
	<reboot>

Now you can boot your upgraded system as usually, but take the
new kernel! To finish up, you should rebuild your /dev-directory:
	cd /dev
	./MAKEDEV all
