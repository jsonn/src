The Atari release stepped in in March 1995. The first official release was
NetBSD1.1. About a year later, NetBSD1.2 was released for the Atari. This
release fixed a large number of bugs and made the Atari-port a stable member
of the NetBSD family.
And now, finally, a NetBSD1.3 release is available! This release adds support
for a brand new atari-compatible platform: The Hades. Both the 040 and
060 flavours are supported, unfortunately only the et4000-PCI console is
currently supported. Also new in this release is the ethernet support for the
TT030 by means of a Riebl driver and the IDE support for the Falcon.
