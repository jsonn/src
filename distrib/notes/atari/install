Installing NetBSD is a relatively complex process, but, if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.

Before you begin, you must have already prepared your hard disk as
detailed in the section on preparing your system for install.

The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to get NetBSD
installed on your hard disk.  If you wish to stop the installation,
you may hit Control-C at any prompt, but if you do, you'll have to
begin again from scratch.

    1. Booting the miniroot
    =======================
	First you need to get yourself into NetBSD.  This can be
	done in a couple ways, both of which currently require
	GEMDOS.

	You can insert the GEMDOS kernel floppy and select
	the loadbsd program. It will ask for parameters, 
	supply: '-b netbsd'.  You can, of course, also run it
	from the shell command-line in MiNT:

		loadbsd -b a:/netbsd

	You should see the screen clear and some information about
	your system as the kernel configures the hardware.  Then
	you will be prompted for a root device.  At this time remove
	the GEMDOS kernel boot floppy from the drive if present and
	insert the BSD install floppy 1.  Now type `rd0' to tell the
	kernel to load the install filesystem into RAMdisk. While
	While the kernel is loading, it will show a '.' for each
	track loaded. After loading 80 tracks, it will ask you
	to insert the next floppy. At this time, inser the BSD
	install floppy 2 and hit any key. The kernel continous
	loading another 40 tracks before it continues to boot.

	The system should continue to boot.  For now ignore WARNING:
	messages about bad dates in clocks. Eventually you will be
	be asked to enter the pathname of the shell, just hit
	return.  After a short while, you will be asked to select
	the type of your keyboard. After you have entered a valid
	response here, the system asks you if you want to install
	or upgrade your system. Since you are reading the 'install'
	section, 'i' would be the proper response here...

    2. Entering the installer
    =========================
	The installer starts with a nice welcome messages. Read this
	message carefully, it also informs you of the risks involved
	in continueiNg! If you still want to go on, type 'y'. The
	installer now continues by trying to figure out your disk
	configuration. Ignore the error:
		kern_fs_get_rrootdev: no raw root device
	When it is done, you will be prompted to select a root device
	from the list of disks it has found.

    3. Select your root device
    ==========================
	You should know at this point that the disks are NOT numbered
	according to their scsi-id! The NetBSD kernel numbers the scsi
	drives (and other devices on the scsi bus) sequentially as it
	finds them. The drive with the lowest scsi id will be called sd0,
	the next one sd1, etc.
	Where you end up after the selection of the root disk depends on
	the contents of your disk. If it is already partitioned using
	AHDI, start reading at item 4a, if this disk has no AHDI partitioning
	but is blank or used by another non-AHDI system, start at item 4b.

	YOU ARE NOW AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN! The programs in section
	4 will modify your harddisk. Type Control-C NOW if you don't
	want this.

    4a. Setting AHDI partition id's on your root disk (using edahdi)
    ================================================================
	Because NetBSD imposes a special ordering in disk partitions it
	uses for root & swap. And because it wants to guard you against
	an unwanted demolition of partitions used by other systems, you
	have to tell it what partitions it is allowed to use. You have
	to mark the partition you want to use as swap 'NBS' or 'SWP'
	and the other partitions as 'NBD'. Note that all the changes
	you make to the id's are reversable as long as you remember the
	original value.
	In the partition-id editor, the partitions are shown in the order
	that AHDI created them. When you leave this editor and continue
	at item 4b, your changes to the id's do have consequences to the
	partition order! They will show up as follows:
		a          -- the first NBD partition
                b          -- the first NBS partition
                d (and up) -- the rest of the partitions in AHDI order

    4b. Labeling your root disk (using edlabel)
    ===========================================
	You are now allowed to change the partitioning of your disk. If
	your disk is already partitioned with AHDI DON'T change anything
	unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing!
	If you are labeling an empty SCSI disk, you can make life easy for
	yourself by selecting 'standarize geometry'. This allows you to
	select a 'sectors per track' and 'tracks/cylinder' value and have
	the (fictious) SCSI geometry changed accordingly. So if you select
	64 sect/track and 32 tracks/cylinder, each cilinder is exactly
	1Mb in size. Well, go ahead and don't forget to save your work
	before quitting!
	NOTE: to make sure that NetBSD can create/mount filesystems on
	      the partitions you defined, make sure the 'type' is entered
	      correctly:
                4.2BSD - filesystems created by NetBSD
                MSDOS  - filesystems shared with GEM
	
	Just ignore it, it's harmless.

    5. Label additional disks
    =========================
	Now that your root-disk is labeled, you are given the opportunity
	to label any of the other disks in your system. The procedure is
	the same as with your root disk.

    6. Setup the fstab
    ==================
	Since all disks you want to use with NetBSD are properly labeled,
	it is time to tell the installer which partition will be associated
	with the different filesystems. As mentioned above, it is wise to
	make at least a separate root and /usr filesystem. Depending on
	what you are planning to do with your system, you might also consider
	to make a separate /var, /local or /home.
	When you tell the installer that all of your filesystems are specified
	correctly, it starts creating them for you.

    7. Configure your network
    =========================
	Don't do this right now. As non of the network cards are supported,
	it doesn't make any sense.

    8. Edit the fstab - again....
    =============================
	Since the network configuration might have lead to additional (nfs)
	filesystem entries, you get another chance to modify your fstab.

    9. Installing the distribution sets
    ===================================
	Your are finally at the point where some real data will be put on
	your freshly made filesystems. Select the device type you whish
	to install from and off you go....
	Some notes:
	    - If you want to install from tape, please read the section
	      about how to create such a tape.
	    - If you want to install from a gemdos filesystem, you should
	      rename the distribution sets because of the nameing limitations
	      on gemdos. Move all 'xxx.tar.gz' sets to 'xxx.tgz'. The
	      installer will handle the rest.
	    - Install at least the base and etc sets.
	    - If you have to specify a path relative to the mount-point and
	      you need the mount-point itself, enter '.'.

    10. Timezone selection and device-node building
    ===============================================
	The isn't much to say about this. Just select the timezone you
	are in. The installer will make the correct setup on your root
	filesystem. After the timezone-link is installed, the installer
	will proceed by creating the device nodes on your root filesystem.
	Be patient, this will take a while...

    11. Installing the kernel
    =========================
	Because the kernel didn't fit on the install-disks, the installer
	asks you about the disk you're kernel is on. You can specify the
	same disks as with the installation of the sets with the addition of
	'fd0'. The latter can be used when you decide to install the kernel
	from the kernel-floppy.

    12. Installing the bootstrap
    ============================
	Finally, the installer ask you if you want to install the bootblock
	code on your root disk. This is a matter of personal choise and can
	also be done from a running NetBSD system. See the 'installboot(8)'
	manual page about how to do this.

    13. You did it!
    ===============
	Congratulations, you just installed NetBSD successfully! If you
	also installed a bootblock, you only have to reboot your atari to
	enter your freshly build system. If you didn't, get back to section
	1 (How to boot the miniroot). Just substitute 'rd0' by your NetBSD
	root disk.


Some extra remarks:
===================

If you don't want to use the bootloader. You could use the following
setup:
	Reserve a small GEMDOS partition of about 4Mb. This is
	enough to put in a few kernels. Put the netbsd kernel
	into this partition. Also, edit your /etc/fstab to always
	mount this partition, say as /kernels. Now make a symlink
	from /netbsd to /kernels/netbsd.
	This sceme is particulary handy when you want to make your
	own kernel. When compilation is finished, you just copy
	your kernel to /kernels/netbsd and reboot. It's wise to
	make sure there is _always_ a 'known to work' kernel image
	present.
