This is the first major release of
.Nx*M .
.Pp
Unlike previous releases of
.Nx
for the ARM architecture, the \*M port uses the ELF
binary format.
However,
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with
old
.Nx
a.out ARM binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local
programs provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options
in your kernel configuration.
