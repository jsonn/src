The arm32-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"arm32" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/arm32/
			INSTALL		Installation notes; this file.

			binary/		arm32 binary distribution sets;
					see below.

			kernels/	arm32 installation and other
					kernels; see below.

			security/	arm32 security distribution;
					see below;

			<platform>/	Miscellaneous arm32
					installation utilities and
					supplementary documentation for
					<platform>; see installation
					section, below.

There are a collection of arm32 kernels in the "arm32/kernels"
subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution. Some of these kernels
contain a root file system image and should only be used for the
initial installation. Some of the kernels only support a particular
subset of the platforms that arm32 supports (See
"arm32/kernels/README" for more details.)

The NetBSD/arm32 binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD _VER release for the arm32.  There are eight binary
distribution sets and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the "arm32/binary"
subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution tree, and are as follows:


	base13	The NetBSD/arm32 _VER base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ ~11M gzipped, 28M uncompressed ]

	comp13	The NetBSD/arm32 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN (yes, there are two!).
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries (except the shared
		libraries, which are included as part of the base
		set).  This set also includes the manual pages for all
		of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 7.5M gzipped, 25M uncompressed ]

	etc13	This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 52K gzipped, 310K uncompressed ]

	games13	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 3M gzipped, 7.4M uncompressed ]

	man13	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.2M gzipped, 9.5M uncompressed ]

	misc13	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 2M gzipped, 8M uncompressed ]

	text13	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1M gzipped, 3.8M uncompressed ]


The arm32 security distribution set is named "secr13" and can be found
in the "arm32/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution
tree.  It contains security related binaries which depend on
cryptographic source code. You do not need this distribution set to use
encrypted passwords in your password file; the "base13" distribution
includes a crypt library which can perform only the decryption function.
The security distribution includes a version of the Kerberos IV
network security system, and a Kerberized version of the "telnet" program.
The "secr13" distribution set can be found only on those sites which
carry the complete NetBSD distribution and which can legally obtain it.
(Remember, because of United States law, it may not be legal to distribute
this set to locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
	[ 154K gzipped, 358K uncompressed ]

The arm32 binary distribution sets are distributed in the same form as
the source distribution sets; catted together, the members of a set
form a gzipped tar file.  Each arm32 binary distribution set also has
its own "CKSUMS" file, just as the source distribution sets do.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the "tar xfp"
from /.  Also note that if you upgrade or install this way, those
programs that you are using at the time will NOT be replaced.  If you
follow the normal installation or upgrade procedures, this will be
taken care of for you.
