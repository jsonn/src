Upgrading from a previous version of NetBSD isn't currently supported by
NetBSD/arm32.  If you are currently running NetBSD/arm32 then make a
FULL BACKUP of your current installation, and install NetBSD _VER from
scratch.  Obviously some of the steps can be skipped (in particular,
hard disk partitioning) as they will already be done.
