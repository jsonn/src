NetBSD/arm32 _VER runs on several systems with ARM6 or above processors,
with or without FPU coprocessor.  The minimal configuration is said to
require 8M of RAM and 50M of disk space, though we do not know of anyone
running with a system quite this minimal today.  To install the entire
system requires much more disk space (the unpacked binary distribution,
without sources, requires at least 65M without counting space needed for
swap space, etc), and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is
recommended. (8M of RAM will actually allow you to run X and/or compile,
but it won't be speedy.  Note that until you have around 16M of RAM,
getting more RAM is more important than getting a faster CPU.)

Supported devices include (but is not limit to):
	RiscPC/A7000(+) floppy controller.
	IDE controllers:
		Acorn motherboard IDE.
		Simtec IDE controller.
		RapIDE IDE controller.
		ICS IDE controller.

	SCSI host adapters:
		Cumana SCSI 2.
		PowerTec SCSI 2.
		MCS Connect32 SCSI 2.
		Acorn SCSI.
		Oak SCSI I.
		Morley SCSI I (uncached only).

	VIDC20 video.
	RiscPC Motherboard serial port.
	RiscPC Motherboard parallel port.
	Ethernet adapters:
		Acorn Ether1.
		Atomwide Ether3.
		ANT Ether3.
		ANT Ether5.
		Atomwide EtherA.
		ANT EtherB.
		Acorn EtherH.
		I-cubed EtherH.
		ANT EtherM.

	Most SCSI tape drives.
	CD-ROM drives:
		Most SCSI CD-ROM drives.
		Most ATAPI CD-ROM drives.
			[ Note: Some low-priced IDE CDROM drives are known
			 for being not or not fully ATAPI compliant, and thus
			 requires some hack (generally an entry to a quirk
			 table) to work with NetBSD.]

	Mice:
		RiscPC quadrature mouse.
		A7000 PS/2 mouse.

	Processors:
		ARM 610.
		ARM 700.
		ARM 700 + FPA11.
		ARM 710.
		ARM 7500.
		ARM 7500FE.
		ARM 810. [*]
		SA110.

	Motherboards:
		Acorn RiscPC.
		Acorn A7000 (experimental).
		Acorn A7000+ (experimental).
		VLSI RC7500 (experimental).

	Other devices:
		RiscPC keyboard.
		A7000 keyboard.
		RiscPC realtime clock.
		VLSI RC7500 motherboard devices.

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT present in installation
kernels. 

Support for some devices is limited to particular kernels. eg there is no
SA110 support in A7000 kernels.

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	Acorn/Aleph1 PC cards.
	Any SCSI card using a PowerROM.
	Podule based serial ports.
	Castle SCSI/Ethernet cards.

Drivers are planned for some of the above.
