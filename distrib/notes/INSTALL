INSTALLATION NOTES for NetBSD/MACHINE 1.2



Be sure to read _ALL_ of this document before you try to install
NetBSD/MACHINE.



What is NetBSD?
---- -- ------

The NetBSD Operating System is a fully functional UN*X-like system
derrived from the Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite,
and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.  NetBSD runs on many architectures and is
being ported to more.

NetBSD is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that this release wouldn't have come about.

The current release has built upon the successful NetBSD 1.1 release
by integrating many bug fixes, adding new and updated kernel
subsystems, and adding various userland enhancements.  The results of
these improvements is a stable operating system fit for production use
and ready for the next phase of development.


Significant changes include:

	Continuing the multi-platform tradition, the integration of
	the DEC Alpha port has been completed, and new ports to ARM
	and x68k have been added.

	NetBSD/sparc now supports 4m machines. 

	NetBSD/amiga now supports the DraCo.

	Standard C Prototypes have been added to the Kernel.

	Kernel NTP (Network Time Protocol) phased lock loop support has
	been added.  See http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ for more 
	details.

	The PINT (PINT is not TWAIN) SCSI scanner driver interface has
	been integrated.  See http://www.dol-esa.gov/~kstailey/pint 
	for more details.

	A new SCSI medium changer driver and the `chio' program used to 
	operate it has been added.

	The NFS subsystem now supports NFSv3.

	Several performance enhancements have been made to the 
	networking subsystem.

	GCC, Libg++, and many other third party programs have been 
	upgraded to more recent versions.

Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems
and device drivers are shared among the different ports. You can look
for this trend to continue.

NetBSD 1.2 also includes some refinement to the NetBSD binary emulation
system (which includes FreeBSD, HP-UX, iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4,
Solaris and Ultrix compatibility), bringing NetBSD closer to the goal of
making the emulation as accurate as possible.

The Future of NetBSD:
--- ------ -- ------

The NetBSD Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization.  Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the
free exchange of computer software, namely the NetBSD Operating
System.  The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the NetBSD Project.

The NetBSD Foundation will help improve the quality of NetBSD by:

	* providing better organization to keep track of development
	  efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in 
	  related fields.

	* providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
          services and to own the resources necessary to run the
          NetBSD Project.

        * providing a better position from which to undertake
          promotional activities.

        * periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
          interested people to discuss ongoing work.

We hope to have regular releases of the full binary and source trees,
but these are difficult to coordinate, especially with all of the
architectures which we now support!  

We hope to support even _more_ hardware in the future, and have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
NetBSD.  

We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.

We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
will provide them, providing that they are well thought-out and
increase the usability of the system.

Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of NetBSD users, because it is for
and because of them that NetBSD exists.

NetBSD 1.2 Release Contents:
------ --- ------- --------

The NetBSD 1.2 release is organized in the following way:

.../NetBSD-1.2/
		BUGS			Known bugs list (incomplete
					and out of date).

		CHANGES			Changes since NetBSD's last
					release (and before).

		LAST_MINUTE		Last minute changes.

		MIRRORS			A list of sites that mirror
					the NetBSD 1.2 distribution.

		README.files		README describing the
					distribution's contents.

		TODO			NetBSD's todo list (incomplete
					and out of date).

		patches/		Post-release source code
					patches.

		source/			Source distribution sets; see
					below.

In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures that NetBSD
1.2 has a binary distribution for.  There are also
'README.export-control' files sprinkled liberally throughout the
distribution tree, which point out that there are some portions of the
distribution (e.g. those containing crypt(3)) that should not be
exported from the United States, and that if you do export them, it's
your fault, not ours.

The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
"source" subdirectory of the distribution tree.  They contain the 
complete sources to the system.  The source distribution sets 
are as follows:

	dsrc12	This set contains the "domestic" sources.  These
		sources contain export-restricted encryption code
		and should not be exported from the U.S.
		[ 140K gzipped, 655K uncompressed ]

	gsrc12	This set contains the "gnu" sources, including
		the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
		and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution
		sets.
		[ 7.1M gzipped, 30.4M uncompressed ]

	ksrc12	This set contains the sources to the NetBSD 1.2
		kernel, config(8), config.old(8) and dbsym(8).
		[ 6.0M gzipped, 27.0M uncompressed ]

	ssrc12	This set contains the "share" sources, which include
		the sources for the man pages not associated with
		any particular program, the sources for the
		typesettable document set, the dictionaries, and more.
		[ 2.4M gzipped, 8.9M uncompressed ]

	src12	This set contains all of the NetBSD 1.2 sources which
		are not mentioned above.
		[ 9.3M gzipped, 41.6M uncompressed ]

It is worth noting that unless all of the source distribution sets
are installed (except the domestic set), you can't rebuild and install
the system from scratch, straight out of the box.  However, all that is
required to rebuild the system in that case is a trivial modification 
to one Makefile.

The source distribution sets are distributed as groups of files named
"set_name.xx" where "set_name" is the distribution set name, and "xx"
is the sequence number of the file, starting with "aa" for the first
file in the distribution set, then "ab" for the next, and so on.  All
of these files except the last one of each set should be exactly
240,640 bytes long.  (The last file is just long enough to contain the
remainder of the data for that distribution set.)

Catted together, the files belonging to a source distribution set 
comprise a gzipped tar file.  If you want to look at list of the files
contained in the set, you could use the command:

	cat set_name.?? | gunzip | tar tvf -

or to actually extract the files contained in the set:

	cat set_name.?? | gunzip | tar xfp -

In each of the source distribution set directories, there is a file
named "CKSUMS" which contains the checksums of the files in that
directory, as generated by the cksum(1) utility.  You can use cksum to
check the integrity of the archives, if you suspect that one of the
files is corrupt and have access to a cksum binary.

Using online NetBSD documentation
----- ------ ------ -------------

Documentation is available if you first install the manual
distribution set.  Traditionally, the "man pages" (documentation)
are denoted by 'name(section)'.  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropros(1),
	passwd(1), and
	passwd(5).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest:  user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The 'man' command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering 'man [section] topic'.  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter 

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly 
related man pages will be displayed.

Registration?  What's that?

If you've got something to say, do so!  We'd like your input.
There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at <majordomo@NetBSD.ORG>.  To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.

There are various mailing lists set up to deal with comments and
questions about this release.  Please send comments to:

	netbsd-comments@NetBSD.ORG

To report bugs, use the 'send-pr' command shipped with NetBSD,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good
bug reports include lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:

	netbsd-bugs@NetBSD.ORG

Use of 'send-pr' is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the NetBSD bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.

There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of NetBSD.  Use majordomo to find their addresses.  If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the "owner" of that port (listed
below).

If you'd like to help with this effort, and have an idea as to how
you could be useful, send mail and/or subscribe to:

	netbsd-help@NetBSD.ORG

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists.  Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.

go off to Brian Berliner, Jeff Polk, and the various other people
who've had a hand in making CVS a useful tool.

Alistair G. Crooks <agc@westley.demon.co.uk> has been producing tar 
file snapshot reports for NetBSD-current users, a very valuable 
service.

Dave Burgess <burgess@cynjut.infonet.net> has been maintaining the
386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD FAQ for quite some time, and deserves to be
recognized for it.

The following people (in alphabetical order) have made donations or
loans of hardware and/or money, to support NetBSD development, and
deserve credit for it:
#include "donations"
(If you're not on that list and should be, tell us!  We probably were
not able to get in touch with you, to verify that you wanted to be
listed.)

Finally, we thank all of the people who've put sweat and tears into
developing NetBSD since its inception in January, 1993.  (Obviously,
there are a lot more people who deserve thanks here.  If you're one of
them, and would like to mentioned, tell us!)
