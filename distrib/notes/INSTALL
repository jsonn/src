INSTALLATION NOTES for NetBSD/MACHINE 1.1



Be sure to read _ALL_ of this document before you try to install
NetBSD/MACHINE.



What is NetBSD?
---- -- ------

NetBSD is a Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2) and 4.4BSD-Lite
-derived system.  It is a fully functional UN*X-like system which runs
on several architectures and is being ported to more.  NetBSD, as the
name implies, is a creation of the members of the network community
and without the net it's likely that this release wouldn't have come
about.

NetBSD 1.0 is a milestone release.  The hardest part of the 4.4BSD-Lite
integration, the kernel, has been completed and has been running in
"production use" for quite some time.  Also, NetBSD 1.0 is the first
true multi-architecture release of NetBSD.  At the time of NetBSD 0.9,
the i386 port was considered 'production quality' and the hp300 port was
barely working.  The NetBSD 1.0 source supports nine architectures, and
complete binary releases for most of them will be made available.

NetBSD 1.0 supports many new and improved features, the most important
relating to file systems.  New and improved versions of both the
Berkeley Fast File System and the free implementation of the NFS
protocol were provided, as part of the 4.4-Lite release.  The new
versions include such improvements as support for 64-bit file sizes,
for local files, and "lease" support for NFS, to improve performance.
In addition to the file system improvements, many other parts of the
system have been improved considerably.  For instance, the virtual
memory code has substantially improved performance, and many of the
kernel's interfaces have been cleaned up.

Many new user programs have been added in NetBSD 1.0, as well,
bringing it closer to our goal of supplying a complete UN*X-like
environment.  Additionally, support for shared libraries has been
added, for most architectures, allowing a significant savings in both
RAM consumption and disk space.

The Future of NetBSD:
--- ------ -- ------

We hope to have regular releases of the full binary and source trees,
but these are difficult to coordinate, especially with all of the
architectures which we now support!  We hope to support even _more_
hardware in the future, and have a rather large number of other ideas
about what can be done to improve NetBSD.  We intend to continue our
current practice of making the NetBSD-current development source
available on a daily or nearly-daily basis.

We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
will provide them, providing that they are well thought-out and increase
the usability of the system.  This includes integrating the remainder of
the 4.4BSD-Lite tape, as quickly as we can ensure that everything works
properly.

Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of NetBSD users, because it is for
and because of them that NetBSD exists.

NetBSD 1.1 Release Contents:
------ --- ------- --------

The NetBSD 1.1 release is organized in the following way:

.../NetBSD-1.1/
		BUGS			Known bugs list (incomplete
					and out of date).

		CHANGES			Changes since NetBSD's last
					release (and before).

		LAST_MINUTE		Last minute changes.

		MIRRORS			A list of sites that mirror
					the NetBSD 1.1 distribution.

		README.files		README describing the
					distribution's contents.

		TODO			NetBSD's todo list (incomplete
					and out of date).

		patches/		Post-release source code
					patches.

		source/			Source distribution sets; see
					below.

In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures that NetBSD
1.1 has a binary distribution for.  There are also
'README.export-control' files sprinkled liberally throughout the
distribution tree, which point out that there are some portions of the
distribution (e.g. those containing crypt(3)) that should not be
exported from the United States, and that if you do export them, it's
your fault, not ours.

The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
"source" subdirectory of the distribution tree.  They contain the 
complete sources to the system, excluding those portions which should
not be exported from the U.S.  (Those are contained in each
architecture's "security" binary distribution set.)  The source
distribution sets are as follows:

	gsrc11	This set contains the "gnu" sources, including
		the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
		and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution
		sets.
		[ 7.7M gzipped, 32.0M uncompressed ]

	ksrc11	This set contains the sources to the NetBSD 1.1
		kernel, config(8), config.new(8) and dbsym(8).
		[ 4.5M gzipped, 20.8M uncompressed ]

	ssrc11	This set contains the "share" sources, which include
		the sources for the man pages not associated with
		any particular program, the sources for the
		typesettable document set, the dictionaries, and more.
		[ 2.3M gzipped, 8.5M uncompressed ]

	src11	This set contains all of the NetBSD 1.1 sources which
		are not mentioned above.
		[ 7.1M gzipped, 33.4M uncompressed ]

It is worth noting that unless all of the source distribution sets
are installed, you can't rebuild and install the system from scratch,
straight out of the box.  However, all that is required to rebuild the
system in that case is a trivial modification to one Makefile.

The source distribution sets are distributed as groups of files named
"set_name.xx" where "set_name" is the distribution set name, and "xx"
is the sequence number of the file, starting with "aa" for the first
file in the distribution set, then "ab" for the next, and so on.  All
of these files except the last one of each set should be exactly
240,640 bytes long.  (The last file is just long enough to contain the
remainder of the data for that distribution set.)

Catted together, the files belonging to a source distribution set 
comprise a gzipped tar file.  If you want to look at list of the files
contained in the set, you could use the command:

	cat set_name.?? | gunzip | tar tvf -

or to actually extract the files contained in the set:

	cat set_name.?? | gunzip | tar xfp -

In each of the source distribution set directories, there is a file
named "CKSUMS" which contains the checksums of the files in that
directory, as generated by the cksum(1) command.  You can use cksum to
check the integrity of the archives, if you suspect that one of the
files is corrupt and have access to a cksum binary.

Registration?  What's that?

If you've got something to say, do so!  We'd like your input.
There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at <majordomo@NetBSD.ORG>.  To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.

There are various mailing lists set up to deal with comments and
questions about this release.  Please send comments to:

	netbsd-comments@NetBSD.ORG

To report bugs, use the 'send-pr' command shipped with NetBSD,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good
bug reports include lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:

	netbsd-bugs@NetBSD.ORG

Use of 'send-pr' is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the NetBSD bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.

There are also port-specific mailing lists, to discuss aspects of
each port of NetBSD.  Use majordomo to find their addresses.  If
you're interested in doing a serious amount of work on a specific
port, you probably should contact the "owner" of that port (listed
below).

If you'd like to help with this effort, and have an idea as to how
you could be useful, send mail and/or subscribe to:

	netbsd-help@NetBSD.ORG

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to these
mailing lists.  Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.


Thanks go to:
------ -- --

Members and former members of UCB's Computer Systems Research Group,
including (but not limited to):
	Keith Bostic
	Ralph Campbell
	Mike Karels
	Marshall Kirk McKusick
for their ongoing work on BSD systems, support, and encouragement.

Also, our thanks go to:
	Mike Hibler
	Rick Macklem
	Jan-Simon Pendry
	Chris Torek
for answering lots of questions, fixing bugs, and doing the various work
they've done.

UC Berkeley's Experimental Computing Facility has provided a home for
sun-lamp, people to look after it, and a sense of humor.  Rob
Robertson, too, has added his unique sense of humor to things, and for
a long time provided the primary FTP site for NetBSD.

Without CVS, this project would be impossible to manage, so our hats
go off to Brian Berliner, Jeff Polk, and the various other people
who've had a hand in making CVS a useful tool.

The following people (in alphabetical order) have made donations or
loans of hardware and/or money, to support NetBSD development, and
deserve credit for it:
#include "donations"
(If you're not on that list and should be, tell us!  We probably were
not able to get in touch with you, to verify that you wanted to be
listed.)

Dave Burgess <burgess@cynjut.infonet.net> has been maintaining the
386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD FAQ for quite some time, and deserves to be
recognized for it.

Finally, we thank all of the people who've put sweat and tears into
developing NetBSD since its inception in January, 1993.  (Obviously,
there are a lot more people who deserve thanks here.  If you're one of
them, and would like to mentioned, tell us!)
