The upgrade to
.Nx
\*V is a binary upgrade; it can be quite difficult
to advance to a later version by recompiling from source due primarily
to interdependencies in the various components.
.Pp
To do the upgrade, you must have at least base.tgz on disk and
a copy of the proper netbsd.default.  It will require quite a bit
of disk space to do the upgrade.
.Pp
Since upgrading involves replacing the kernel, and most of the system
binaries, it has the potential to cause data loss.  You are strongly
advised to BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT DATA ON YOUR DISK, whether on the
.Nx
partition or on another operating system's partition, before
beginning the upgrade process.
.Pp
To upgrade your system, follow the following instructions:
.(bullet
Assuming you have space, load the .tgz files onto disk
some place.  Then boot the floppy-144.fs image via the
method you use.  Under the install system, extract the
\&.tgz files as mentioned below or read the i386 INSTALL
notes for how to use sysinst.
.It
Extract the .tgz files.
For example, to extract
.Pa base.tgz :
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd /"
.Dl # Ic "pax -zrvpe -f /gz.files/base.tgz"
.It
Extract all the .tgz files you want.  You should carefully
work at upgrading
.Pa /etc .
There may be changes to file formats depending on what version of
.Nx*M
you are running.
.It
.Em Be careful if you are not running with security.
The \*V distribution does contain support for password encryption.
If you are upgrading from
.Nx 1.0
, it would be reasonable to save a
copy of master.passwd and remove all passwords until after you
upgrade, as
.Nx 1.0
did not ship with password encryption.
.It
Place
.Pa netbsd.default
in
.Pa /
as the file
.Pa netbsd .
.It
Reboot.  (Remember,
.Pa netbsd.default
is a 9600 console line kernel.  Read the last part of the new installation
part of these notes to find out how to change your default speed.)
.It
After reboot, you should make sure you check your new file systems.
