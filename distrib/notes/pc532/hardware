NetBSD/pc532 1.2 runs on a PC532 computer.  It supports a subset of the
"standard" hardware to date.  This is defined as:

	4 - 32 Megs of memory
	8 serial lines done by 4 scn2681 chips
	the NCR DP8490 SCSI chip (scsi only)
		Most SCSI disks work (fixed and floppy)
		A few SCSI tapes work
		Some SCSI CD-ROM drives work
	The Matthias Pfaller Parallel Port.

NetBSD/pc532 currently expects the ROM monitor to be the "autoboot
monitor" of Oct/Nov 1991.  It includes support to set up auto booting
of NetBSD, including a secondary boot program that the autoboot monitor
will load that in turn loads the NetBSD kernel from a NetBSD file system.
(Source and ROM images of the autoboot monitor are located at
ftp://ftp.cs.wwu.edu/pub/pc532/mon.auto.tar.gz.)

Most of the pc532 specific development of NetBSD/pc532 was done on a
machine with 8-Megs of memory.  It should run with 4-Megs of memory
although it may be slower.
