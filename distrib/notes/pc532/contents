The pc532-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"pc532" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory contains
the files as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/pc532/

	INSTALL			Installation notes; this file.

.../NetBSD-_VER/pc532/binary/sets

	base.tgz		base distribution
	comp.tgz		compiler tools & libraries
	etc.tgz			files for /etc
	kern.tgz		distribution kernel, install and upgrade
	games.tgz		/usr/games and friends
	man.tgz			/usr/man
	misc.tgz		various
	text.tgz		groff and friends

.../NetBSD-_VER/pc532/installation/floppy

	floppy-144.gz		Installation file system.

.../NetBSD-_VER/pc532/

	download.c.gz		Source for a pc532 ROM compat download pgm

The binary distribution consists of the following files:

	base.tgz
		The NetBSD/pc532 _VER base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		excludes everything described below.
		[ 9.4M gzipped ]

	comp.tgz
		The NetBSD/pc532 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, Objective C, and FORTRAN (yes,
		there are two, although NO FORTRAN compiler!).
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries.  This set also includes
		the manual pages for all the utilities it contains, as well
		as the system call and library manual pages.
		[ 6.8M gzipped ]

	etc.tgz
		This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 53K gzipped ]

	games.tgz
		This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.9M gzipped ]

	kern.tgz
		This is the default kernel for both the standard install
		and for the upgrade.

	man.tgz
		This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.4M gzipped ]

	misc.tgz
		This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 2.2M gzipped ]

	text.tgz
		This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1.0M gzipped ]

The pc532 distribution set does not include a security distribution.
If you are in the US and want the security distribution you must
get the security source distribution and recompile libcrypt.a and
recompile the following programs:
	ed, ftpd, makekey, rexecd, uucpd, init, lock, login, passwd,
	skeyinit, su, tn3270, pppd


The initial installation process on a pc532 without NetBSD/pc532
is supported by the following files:

	Initial file system used via SCSI floppy or downloaded into 
	memory:

	floppy-144.fs		-- file system containing boot loader 
				   and install kernel with 2MB
				   ram root file system.

	download.c		-- source for the program to download
				   inst-11.fs into memory via the
				   pc532 ROM monitor.


The upgrade process is supported by having a copy of a _VER kernel
available.  This file is:

	kern.tgz		-- contains a kernel produced from the 
				   DEFAULT configuration file in pc532/conf.
