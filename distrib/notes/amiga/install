Installing
.Nx
is a relatively complex process, but, if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.
.Pp
Before you begin, you must have already prepared your hard disk as
detailed in the section on preparing your system for install.
.Pp
The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to get NetBSD
installed on your hard disk.  If you wish to stop the installation,
you may hit Control-C at any prompt, but if you do, you'll have to
begin again from scratch.
.Pp
Transfer the miniroot file system onto the hard disk partition
used by
.Nx
for swapping, as described in the "Preparing
your System for
.Nx
Installation" section above.
.Ss2 Booting\ from\ AmigaOS,\ using\ loadbsd:
You then need to have
.Pa ixemul.library
in your
.Pa LIBS:
directory on AmigaDOS.  You also need to have the
.Ic loadbsd No program
in your command path.  If AmigaDOS complains about loadbsd
not being an executable file, be sure that the
.Em Execute
protection bit is set.  If not, set it with the command:
.Dl Protect loadbsd add e
.Pp
Next you need to get yourself into
.Nx
by loading the
kernel from AmigaDOS with loadbsd like so:
.Dl loadbsd -b netbsd
.Pp
If you have an AGA machine, and your monitor will handle
the dblNTSC mode, you may also include the
.Fl A No option to
enable the dblNTSC display mode.
.Pp
If your machine has a fragmented physical memory space, as, 
e.g., DraCo machines, you should add the
.Fl n2 No option to 
enable the use of all memory segments.
.Ss2 Directly\ booting\ NetBSD,\ with\ boot\ blocks\ installed:
.Pp
[This description is for V40 (OS 3.1) ROMs. For older ROMs,
there might be small differences. Check your AmigaOS documentation
to learn about the exact procedure.]
Using bootblocks may not work on some
systems, and may require a mountable filesystem on others.
.Pp
Reboot your machine, holding down both mouse buttons if you 
have a 2-button mouse, the outer mouse buttons if you have
a 3-button mouse. On the DraCo, press the left mouse button
instead, when the boot screen prompts you for it.
.Pp
From the boot menu, select
.Ic Boot Options .
Select the swap partition with the miniroot, and then
.Ic ok .
Select
.Ic Boot No now .
The machine will boot the bootblock, which
will prompt your for a command line. You have a few seconds time
to change the default. Entering an empty line will accept the default.
.Pp
The bootblock uses command lines of the form:
.br
.Ar \ \ \ \ file Op Ar options
.br
.No where Ar file
is the kernel file name on the partition where the
boot block is on, and
.Op options
are the same as with loadbsd.
E.g., instead of
.Dl loadbsd -bsSn2 netbsd
use
.Dl netbsd -bsSn2
.Ss2 Once\ your\ kernel\ boots:
You should see the screen clear and some information about
your system as the kernel configures the hardware.  Note which
hard disk device(s) are configured (sd0, sd1, etc).  Then
you will be prompted for a root device.  At this time type
.Ic sd0b ,
where
.Ic sd0
is the device which contains the swap
partition you created during the hard disk preparation.
When prompted for a dump device, answer 'none' for the install 
(normally, you would tell it one of the swap devices). When 
prompted for the root filesystem type, confirm 'generic', which 
will auto-detect it. 
.Pp
If the system should hang after entering the root device, try
again with
.Dl loadbsd -I ff -b netbsd
This disables synchronous transfer on all SCSI devices.
.Pp
The system should continue to boot.  For now ignore WARNING:
messages about bad dates in clocks, and a warning about /etc/rc
not existing.  Eventually you will be be asked to enter the
pathname of the shell, just hit return.  After a short while,
you will be asked to select the type of your keyboard.  After
you have entered a valid response here, the system asks you if
you want to install or upgrade your system.  Since you are
reading the 'install' section, 'i' would be the proper
response here...
.Pp
The installer starts with a nice welcome messages.  Read this
message carefully, it also informs you of the risks involved
in continuing!  If you still want to go on, type 'y'.  The
installer now continues by trying to figure out your disk
configuration. 	When it is done, you will be prompted to
select a root device from the list of disks it has found.
.Pp
You should know at this point that the disks are NOT numbered
according to their scsi-id! The
.Nx
kernel numbers the scsi
drives (and other devices on the scsi bus) sequentially as it
finds them. The drive with the lowest scsi id will be called sd0,
the next one sd1, etc.  Also, any Amiga internal IDE disk drives
will be configured as "SCSI" drives, and will be configured
before any 'real' SCSI drives (if any are present).
.Pp
.Em you are now at the point of no return.
If you confirm that
you want to install NetBSD, your hard drive will be modified,
and perhaps its contents scrambled at the whim of the install
program.  Type Control-C NOW if you don't want this.
.Pp
At this time, you will need to tell the installer which partition
will be associated with the different filesystems.
.Pp
The install program will now make the the file systems you
specified.  There should be only one error per file system in
this section of the installation.  It will look like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
newfs: ioctl (WDINFO): Invalid argument
newfs: /dev/rsd0a: can't rewrite disk label
.Ed
.Pp
If there are any others, restart from the the beginning of
the installation process.  This error is ok as the Amiga
does not write disklabels currently.  You should expect
this error whenever using newfs.
.Pp
The install will now ask you want to configure any network
information.  It ill ask for the machine's host name, domain
name, and other network configuration information.
.Pp
Since the network configuration might have lead to additional (nfs)
filesystem entries, you get another chance to modify your fstab.
.Pp
You are finally at the point where some real data will be put on
your freshly made filesystems. Select the device type you wish
to install from and off you go....
.Pp
Some notes:
.Bl -hyphen
.It
If you want to install from tape, please read the section
about how to create such a tape.
.It
Some tapes (e.g. Archive Viper 150) refuse to operate with
the default tape density ("nrst0"). Try "nrst0h",
"nrst0m", or "nrst0l" instead.
.It
Install at least the base and etc sets.
.It
If you have to specify a path relative to the mount-point and
you need the mount-point itself, enter '.'.
.El
.Pp
Next you will be asked to specify the timezone.  Just select the
timezone you are in. The installer will make the correct setup
on your root filesystem. After the timezone-link is installed,
the installer will proceed by creating the device nodes on your
root filesystem.
.Pp
Be patient, this will take a while...
.Pp
Finally, the installer ask you if you want to install the bootblock
code on your root disk. This is a matter of personal choice and can
also be done from a running
.Nx
system. See the 'installboot(8)'
manual page about how to do this.
.Pp
Once the installer is done, halt the system with the
.Ic halt No command
(wait for 
.Li halted
to be displayed) and reboot.  Then again boot
.Nx
this time with the command:
.Dl loadbsd netbsd
or select the root partition from the boot menu, and tell it to boot
.Dl netbsd -s
.Pp
You need to do your final tweaks now.  First mount your file systems
like so:
.Dl mount -av
.Pp
Your system is now complete but not completely configured; you
should adjust the
.Pa /etc/sendmail.cf No file as necessary to suit your
site.  You should also examine and adjust the settings in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
You can use
.Xr vi 1
or
.Xr ed 1
to edit the files. If you installed the man pages
you can type
.Ic man vi No or Ic man ed
for instructions on how to use these somewhat non-intuitive editors.  
.Pp
Once you are done with the rest of configuration unmount your file
systems and halt your system, then reboot:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /
umount -av
halt
.Ed
.Pp
Finally you can now boot your system and it will be completely
functional:
.Dl loadbsd -a netbsd
.Pp
When it boots off of the hard drive, you will have a complete
.Nx
system!  
.Em Congratulations! No (You really deserve them!!!)
