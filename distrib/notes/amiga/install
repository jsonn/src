Installing NetBSD is a relatively complex process, but, if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.

Before you begin, you must have already prepared your hard disk as
detailed in the section on preparing your system for install.

The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to get NetBSD
installed on your hard disk.  If you wish to stop the installation,
you may hit Control-C at any prompt, but if you do, you'll have to
begin again from scratch.

	Transfer the install miniroot filesystem onto the hard disk
	partition used by NetBSD for swapping, as described in the
	"Preparing your System for NetBSD Installation" section above.

	You then need to have "ixemul.library" in your LIBS: directory
	on AmigaDOS.  You also need to have the "loadbsd" program
	in your command path.  If AmigaDOS complains about loadbsd
	not being an executable file, be sure that the "Execute"
	protection bit is set.  If not, set it with the command:
		Protect loadbsd add e

	Next you need to get yourself into NetBSD by loading the
	kernel from AmigaDOS with loadbsd like so:

		loadbsd -b netbsd

	If you have an AGA machine, and your monitor will handle
	the dblNTSC mode, you may also include the "-A" option to
	enable the dblNTSC display mode.

	If your machine has a fragmented physical memory space, as, 
	e.g., DraCo machines, you should add the "-n2" option to 
	enable the use of all memory segments.

	You should see the screen clear and some information about
	your system as the kernel configures the hardware.  Note which
	hard disk device(s) are configured (sd0, sd1, etc).  Then
	you will be prompted for a root device.  At this time type
	'sd0*', where '0' is the device which contains the swap
	partition you created during the hard disk preparation.

	If the system should hang after entering the root device, try
	again with

		loadbsd -I ff -b netbsd

	This disables synchronous transfer on all SCSI devices.

	The system should continue to boot.  For now ignore WARNING:
	messages about bad dates in clocks.  Eventually you will be
	asked to enter the pathname of the shell, just hit return.
	After a short while you should see a welcome message and a
	prompt, asking if you wish to proceed with the installation.

	If you wish to proceed, enter "y" and then return.

	If you have configured your hard drive[s] correctly it
	should find the drive and partition that you selected to
	use as your root.  You will be prompted for which device
	you want to use for your root.  If you have multiple disks
	present with root partitions defined, you will need to be
	sure you enter the device name of the correct partition you
	want to install NetBSD on.

	YOU ARE NOW AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN.  If you confirm that
	you want to install NetBSD, your hard drive will be modified,
	and perhaps its contents scrambled at the whim of the install
	program.

	If you are sure you want to proceed, enter "yes" at the
	prompt.

	The install program will now make the root filesystem you
	specified.  There should be only one error in this section
	of the installation.  It will look like so:

		newfs: ioctl (WDINFO): Invalid argument
		newfs: /dev/rsd0a: can't rewrite disk label

	If there are any others, restart from the the beginning of
	the installation process.  This error is ok as the Amiga
	does not write disklabels currently.  You should expect
	this error whenever using newfs.

	Next the install program will ask you which drive and
	partition you wish to use as /usr.  First it will list the
	available drives.  Choose one.  Next it will give you a
	list of the partitions on that disk along with their sizes,
	types, etc..  Choose the letter that corresponds to the
	partition you wish to use for /usr.  If you are doing a
	full install this should be at the very least 45M-50M large.
	If everything is ok the install program will then format
	and mount your /usr.  If not then it will ask again for a
	drive and partition.

	When this completes your root partition will be mounted on
	/mnt and your /usr partition on /mnt/usr.  An fstab will
	have been created and initialized to correctly mount these
	two file systems.  This fstab will be in /mnt/etc.

	What you do from this point on depends on which media you're
	using to install NetBSD.  Follow the appropriate instructions,
	given below.

	To install from an AmigaDOS partition:

		You first need to mount the AmigaDOS partition
		using the mount_ados command.  If e.g. your AmigaDOS
		partition is the first partition on sd0 you could
		type:
			
			mkdir /mnt/ados
			mount_ados -o ro /dev/sd0d /mnt/ados

		You can use `disklabel sd0' to find out what types
		of partitions are on the disk `sd0'.

		Next goto the directory in which you stored the
		distribution sets.  If e.g. you stored them in the
		root directory of the partition:

			cd /mnt/ados

		When there, run "Set_tmp_dir" and choose the default
		temporary directory, by hitting return at the
		prompt.

		Run the "Extract" command, giving it as its sole
		argument the name of the distribution set you wish
		to extract.  For example, to extract the base
		distribution, use the command:

			Extract base12

		and to extract the games distribution:

			Extract game12

		If the distribution sets are in different directories,
		you will need to cd to each directory in turn, runing
		"Set_tmp_dir" and the appropriate "Extract" command(s).

		Continue this process until you've finished installing
		all of the sets which you desire to have on your
		hard disk.  Once you have extracted all sets and
		are at the "#" prompt again, proceed to the section
		"Configuring Your System," below.

	To install from tape:

		The first thing you should do is pick a temporary
		directory where the distribution files can be stored.
		To do this, use the command "Set_tmp_dir" and enter
		your choice.  The default is /mnt/usr/distrib.

		After you have picked a temporary directory,
		you should issue the load command:

			Load_tape

		Next, you will be told to insert the media into
		the appropriate drive, and hit return.  Continue
		to follow instructions until you are returned to
		the "#" prompt.

		Go to the directory which contains the first
		distribution set you wish to install.  This is
		either the directory you specified above, or possibly
		a subdirectory of that directory.

		When there, run "Set_tmp_dir" again, and choose
		the default temporary directory, by hitting
		return at the prompt.

		Run the "Extract" command, giving it as its sole
		argument the name of the distribution set you
		wish to extract.  For example, to extract the base
		distribution, use the command:

			Extract base12

		and to extract the games distribution:

			Extract game12

		After the extraction is complete, go to the location
		of the next set you want to extract, "Set_tmp_dir"
		again, and once again issue the appropriate
		extract command.  Continue this process until
		you've finished installing all of the sets which you
		desire to have on your hard disk.

		After each set is finished, if you know that you
		are running low on space you can remove the
		distribution files for that set by saying:

			rm set_name.??

		For example, if you wish to remove the distribution
		files for the game09 set, after the "Extract game09"
		command has completed, issue the command:

			rm game12.??

		Once you have extracted all sets and are at the "#" prompt
		again, proceed to the section "Configuring Your System,"
		below.

	To install via FTP or NFS:

		First, use Set_tmp_dir to pick a temporary directory
		for the installation files.  /mnt/usr/distrib is
		suggested.

		Configure the appropriate ethernet interface i.e. le0
		if you have a 2065 or ed0 if you have a AMIGNET from
		Hydra Systems.
		
			ifconfig <ifname> <ipaddr> [netmask <netmask>]

		where <ifname> is the interface name (e.g. ed0, etc.),
		and <ipaddr> is the numeric IP address of the interface.
		If the interface has a special netmask, supply
		the word "netmask" and that netmask at the end of the
		command line.  For instance, without a special netmask:

			ifconfig ed0 129.133.10.10

		or with a special netmask

			ifconfig ed0 128.32.240.167 netmask 0xffffff00

		You should also be able to use SLIP or PPP as the network
		connection.
		[XXX instructions for ppp or slip would be usefull
		perhaps the next release]

		If the NFS server or FTP server is not on a directly-
		connected network, you should set up a route to it
		with the command:

			route add default <gate_ipaddr>

		where <gate_ipaddr> is your gateway's numeric IP address.

		If you are NFS-mounting the distribution sets,
		mount them on the temporary directory with the command:

			mount -t nfs <serv_ipaddr>:<dist_dir> <tmp_dir>

		where <serv_ipaddr> is the server's numeric IP address,
		<dist_dir> is the path to the distribution files on
		the server, and <tmp_dir> is the name of the local
		temporary directory.

		Once this is done, proceed as if you had loaded the
		files from tape, "cd"ing to the appropriate directories
		and running "Set_tmp_dir" and "Extract" as appropriate.

		If you are retrieving the distribution sets using ftp,
		cd into the temp directory, and execute the command:

			ftp <serv_ipaddr>

		where <serv_ipaddr> is once again the server's
		numeric IP address.  Get the files with FTP,
		taking care to use binary mode to transfer
		all files.

		Once you have all of the files for the distribution sets
		you wish to install, you can proceed using the instructions
		above as if you had installed the files from a tape.


Configuring Your System:
----------- ---- ------

Once you have finished extracting all of the distribution sets that
you want on your hard drive and are back at the "#" prompt,
you are ready to configure your system.

The configuration utility expects that you have installed the base
system.  If you have not, you will not be able to run it successfully
(nor will you have a functional system regardless of configuration).

To configure the newly installed operating system, run the
command "Configure".

Configure will ask for the machine's hostname, domain name, and other
network configuration information.

Once you have supplied `Configure' all that it requests, your machine
will be configured well enough that when you reboot it it will
almost be a completely functional NetBSD system.

>>> Copy the kernel from the miniroot filesystem at this point <<<

Once you are done with `Configure', halt the system with the "halt"
command (wait for "halted" to be displayed) and reboot.  Then again
boot NetBSD this time with the command:


	loadbsd netbsd

You need to do your final tweeks now.  First mount your file systems
like so:

	mount -av

Your system is now complete but not completely configured; you
should adjust the /etc/sendmail.cf file as necessary to suit your
site and/or disable sendmail and other network related programs.
These things can be found in /etc/netstart.  Use vi, if you installed
the man pages you can type `man vi' or `man ed' for instructions
on how to use these somewhat non-intuitive editors.

You should also put a copy of the netbsd kernel in your root partition.
This can be done easily by mounting the AmigaDOS partition containing
the kernel you used to start NetBSD and copying the "netbsd" file to
the root:
	mount -r -t ados /dev/sd0d /mnt
	cp /mnt/netbsd /
(where /dev/sd0d is the AmigaDOS partition where you have netbsd, and
/mnt/netbsd is the appropriate path of the netbsd file).

Once you are done with the rest of configuration unmount your file
systems and halt your system, then reboot:

	cd /
	umount -av
	halt
	<reboot>

Finally you can now boot your system and it will be completely
functional:

	loadbsd -a netbsd

When it boots off of the hard drive, you will have a complete
NetBSD system!  CONGRATULATIONS! (You really deserve them!!!)
