NetBSD/amiga 1.1 runs on any amiga that has a 68020, 68030 or 68040 CPU
with some form of FPU and MMU.  The minimal configuration requires
4M of RAM and about 65M of disk space.  To install the entire system
requires much more disk space, and to run X or compile the system,
more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will actually allow you to
compile, however it won't be speedy.  X really isn't usable on a
4M system).

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	15M	15M	10M	10M
	user (/usr)	65M	100M	45M 	80M
	swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/local)	up to you


As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC and 
INSTALL are large and bulky to accommodate all people).

If you only have 4M of fast memory, you should make your swap partition
larger, as your system will be doing much more swapping.
