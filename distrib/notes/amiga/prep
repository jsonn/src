You will need an
.Tn AmigaDOS
hard drive prep tool to prepare your hard
drives for use with
.Nx*M .
HDToolBox is provided with the
system software and on floppy installation disks since Release 2.0
of
.Tn AmigaDOS ,
so we will provide instructions for its use.
.Pp
Note that
.Nx
can't currently be installed on disks with a sector
size other than 512 bytes (e.g.,
.Dq 640 MB
90mm M-O media).
You can, however, mount ADOSFS partitions on such M-O's.
.
.Ss2 Preparing your hard disk with HDToolBox
.
.Pp
A full explanation of HDToolBox can be found with your
.Tn AmigaDOS
manuals and is beyond the scope of this document.
.Pp
The first time you partition a drive, you need to set its drive
type so that you have working geometry parameters.
To do this you enter the
.Dq Change drive type
menu, and either use
.Dq read parameters from drive
or set them manually.
.Pp
Note you will be modifying your HD's.
If you mess something up here you could lose everything on all the
drives that you configure.
It is therefore advised that you:
.(enum -offset indent
Write down your current configurations.
Do this by examining each partition on the drive and the
drives parameters (from Change drive type.)
.It
Back up the partitions you are keeping.
.enum)
.Pp
What you need to do is partition your drives; creating at least
root, swap and
.Pa /usr
partitions and possibly at least one more for
.Pa /usr/local
if you have the space.
.Pp
This should be done as the HDToolBox manual describes.
One thing to note is that if you are not using a Commodore controller you
will need to specify the device your SCSI controller uses, e.g.
if you have a Warp Engine you would:
.(tag From\ cli -offset indent
.It From cli
.Dl Ic "hdtoolbox warpdrive.device"
.It From wb
Set the tooltype
.Pp
.Dl Ic "SCSI_DEVICE_NAME=warpdrive.device"
.tag)
.Pp
The important things you need to do above and beyond normal
partitioning includes (from Partition Drive section):
.(enum
Marking all
.Nx
partitions as non-bootable, with
two exceptions: the root partition
.Pq Pa / ,
if you want to boot
.Nx
directly, or the swap partition, if you want
to boot the installation miniroot directly.
.It
Changing the file system parameters of the partitions to
.Nx
ones.
This must be done from the partitioning section and
.Dq Advanced options
must
be enabled.
.enum)
.Pp
To make the needed changes:
.Pp
.(enum -compact -offset indent
Click the
.Dq Adv. Options
button
.It
Click the
.Dq Change file system
button
.It
Choose
.Dq Custom File System
.It
Turn off
.Dq Automount
if on.
.It
Set the dostype to one of these three choices:
.(disp
root partition  : 0x4e425207	(NBR\\007)
swap partition  : 0x4e425301	(NBS\\001)
other partitions: 0x4e425507	(NBU\\007)
.disp)
.Pp
Here
.Sq Li other
refers to other partitions you will
format for reading and writing under
.Nx
(e.g.
.Pa /usr )
.Pp
Make sure you press
.Key RETURN
to enter this value as some versions of HDToolBox will forget your entry
if you don't.
.It
Turn custom boot code off
.It
Set Reserved Blocks start and end to 0.
.It
Click Ok.
.enum)
.Pp
On the root
.Pq Pa /
(and, for installation, swap) partition,
set instead this:
.Pp
.(enum -compact -offset indent
Turn custom boot code on
.It
Set Reserved Blocks start and end to 0.
.It
Set Number of Custom Boot Blocks to 16.
.It
Set Automount This Partition on
.It
Click Ok.
.Pp
Mask and maxtransfer are not used with
.Nx .
.enum)
.(tag Caveat:
.It Em Caveat:
The swap (for installation) and the root partition (if you plan to
use the bootblocks)
.Em "must be within the first"
4 gigabytes of the disk!
The reason for the former is that xstreamtodev uses trackdisk.device
compatible I/O-calls, the reason for the latter is that the bootblock
gets a 32bit partition offset from the operating system.
.tag)
.Pp
Once this is done
.Nx*M
will be able to recognize your
disks and which partitions it should use.
.
.Ss2 Transferring the miniroot file system
.
The
.Nx*M
installation or upgrade now uses a
.Em miniroot
file system which is installed on the partition used by
.Nx
for swapping.
This removes the requirement of using a floppy disk for the
file system used by the installation or upgrade process.
It also allows more utilities to be present on the file system
than would be available when using an 880 KB floppy disk.
.Pp
Once the hard disk has been prepared for
.Nx ,
the miniroot file system
.Pq Pa miniroot.fs
is transferred to the swap
partition configured during the hard disk prep (or the existing
swap partition in the case of an upgrade).
The xstreamtodev utility provided in the
.Pa \*M/installation/misc
directory can
be used on
.Tn AmigaDOS
to transfer the file system for either a new
installation or an upgrade.
The file system can also be transferred on an existing
.Nx
system for an update by using dd.
This should only be done after booting
.Nx
into single-user state.
It may also be possible to shutdown to single-user, providing that
the single-user state processes are not using the swap partition.
.Pp
On
.Tn AmigaDOS ,
the command:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "xstreamtodev --input=miniroot.fs --rdb-name=\*[Lt]swap partition\*[Gt]"
.Pp
where \*[Lt]swap partition\*[Gt] is the name you gave to the
.Nx
partition to be used for swapping.
If
.Ic xstreamtodev
is unable
to determine the SCSI driver device name or the unit number
of the specified partition, you may also need to include the
option
.Pp
.Dl Ic --device=\*[Lt]driver.name\*[Gt]
.Pp
and/or
.Pp
.Dl Ic --unit=\*[Lt]SCSI unit number\*[Gt]
.Pp
To transfer the miniroot using
.Nx ,
you should be booted up
in single user state on the current
.Nx
system, or use the
.Ic shutdown now
command to shutdown to single-user state.
Then copy the miniroot using
.Ic dd :
.Pp
.Dl Ic "dd if=miniroot.fs of=/dev/rsd0b"
.Pp
where
.Li /dev/rsd0b
should be the device path of the swap partition
your system is configured to use.
Once the file is copied, reboot back to
.Tn AmigaDOS
to boot the upgrade kernel.
.(tag Caveat:
.It Em Caveat:
Once you have started installation, if you abort it
and want to retry you must reinstall the
.Pa miniroot.fs
on the swap partition.
