This is the third public release of NetBSD for the Amiga line of
computers. Several additional graphics, network and SCSI boards are
now supported, as well as the 68060 CPU.

This release should also work on early DraCo models, which still have
a CIA timer. Note, however, that only onboard keyboard, onboard SCSI,
the Altais graphics board, and non-DMA Zorro-II devices are supported
on these machines; no parallel or serial port (especially no mouse) and 
no floppy drives yet.
