release for the \*m. There are eight binary distribution
.ie r_pc532 sets.
.el .No sets and the Em security No distribution set.
The binary distribution sets can be found in the

.Nx
maintains its own set of sources for the X Window System in order to
assure tight integration and compatibility.
These sources are based on XFree86, and tightly track XFree86 releases.
They are currently equivalent to XFree86 3.3.6.
Binary sets for the X Window system are distributed with
.Nx .
Unfortunately there is no R6.3 Xserver for NetBSD/hp300 yet,
so we can only distribute the X clients this time.
The sets are:
.Bl -tag -width xcontribmmm
.It Sy xbase
The basic files needed for a complete X
client environment. This does not include
the X servers.

.\"============================ MI DISCUSSION OF BINARY SETS
.
.Pp
The \*m binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files
named with the extension
.Sy .tgz , No e.g.
.Pa base.tgz .
.
.
.\" contrary to most old INSTALL docs, only i386 has Split/ sets
.
.
.
.Pp
The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are /-relative and
therefore are extracted
.Em below
the current directory. That
is, if you want to extract the binaries into your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the
.Ic tar xfp
command from /.

are installing a diskless NetBSD/hp300
system.
.	It Pa rbootd.tgz
Source code for the rbootd program
