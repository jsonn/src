NetBSD/hp300 _VER will run on most HP 9000/300- and 400-series machines.
The smallest amount of RAM that has been tested is 4M.  If you wish to
run X, more RAM is recommended.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise		needed
	root (/)	25M		15M
	user (/usr)    150M	       100M
	swap		(2 or 3 * RAM)	 6M	(see note below)
	Anything else is up to you!

NOTE:  The hp300 installation procedure uses a `miniroot' filesystem
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.  The swap partition
must be large enough to hold this miniroot image.

			    7958, 7959, 2200, and 2203.
		SCSI-I(**), including magneto-optical and CD-ROM.

	Tape drives:

		98720 and 98721 Renaissance.
		98730 and 98731 DaVinci.
		A1096A monochrome Hyperion.

	Input devices:
		General interface supporting all HIL devices: keyboard,
		2 and 3 button mice(***), and ID module.

	Miscellaneous:
		Battery-backed real-time clock.
		98624 built-in HP-IB interface.
		98625A and 98625B `fast' HP-IB interface.
		98658A built-in and add-on SCSI interface.
		Printers and plotters on RS232 and HP-IB.
		SCSI autochanger.

(*) 400-series machines configured for Domain/OS are not fully supported,
    notably, the keyboard doesn't work and the ROMs must be in `HP-UX mode'.

(**) SCSI-II drives are known to work, though this may require changing a
     jumper on some drives.  See your disk's documentation for details.

(***) Serial mice connected to a `HIL to quad' converter are also known
      to work.

If it's not on this list, there is no official support for it in this release.
