Installation is supported from several media types, including:
.Pp
.(bullet -compact
FTP
.It
NFS
.It
Tape
.bullet)
.Pp
The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which method of installation
you choose. The various methods are explained below.
.
.(tag Tape
.
.It Em FTP
It is possible, using the
.Ic install
and
.Ic upgrade
programs in the miniroot, to extract the binary sets
directly onto disk from an FTP server. This is by far
the easiest installation method, as you may specify to
have all sets extracted at once, providing that they
are located in the same directory on the server.
.Pp
All that is required in this case is that you have
network access to an FTP server. This may be your
account on another system, or may even be ftp.netbsd.org
itself. If you wish to use ftp.netbsd.org as your FTP
file server, you may want to keep the following information
handy:
.(disp
IP Address: ftp.netbsd.org
Login: anonymous
Password: \*<your e-mail address\*>
Server path: /pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-\*V/\*M/binary/sets
.disp)
.(Note
If you're not using a nameserver during installation,
you might find 204.152.184.75 handy; it's the IP address of
ftp.netbsd.org as of October, 2000.
.Note)
.
.It Em NFS
SYS_INST currently requires an NFS server from which to
copy the miniroot.
.(bullet
This file system must be exported with root permissions,
but may be exported read-only.
.It
The miniroot image
.Em must
reside in the
.Sq root
of the
mounted file system. For example, if the client system
mounts
.Li server:/u ,
then the miniroot image must reside in
.Pa /u
on the server. This is due to limitations in the
file lookup code used in SYS_INST, and may be fixed in
a future release.
.It
If you also wish to install the binary sets from the
NFS server, place them in a properly exported file system
on the server. Note that these files do not suffer from
the same placement restrictions as the miniroot.
.bullet)
.
.It Em Tape
If you wish to load SYS_INST from tape, it must
appear on the tape before any other files. To copy
this onto tape, use a command like the following:
.Pp
.Dl Ic "dd if=SYS_INST of=\*<tape_device\*> obs=20b conv=osync"
.Pp
Note that not all HP BOOTROMs support booting from
SCSI tapes.
.Pp
Copying the miniroot to disk from tape is not currently
supported. However, it is planned for a future release.
.Pp
If you wish to extract binary sets onto your disk from
tape, you must first place them on the tape. The easiest
way to do this is with the
.Xr dd 1
command. Make sure you
use a
.Sq no-rewind-on-close
tape device. For example:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "for file in base.tgz etc.tgz; do"
.Dl   Ic "\ \ \ \ dd if=${file} of=/dev/nrst0"
.Dl # Ic "done"
.Pp
Note that depending on your tape drive, you may need to
explicitly set the EOF marker at the end of each file.
It may also be necessary to use the
.Li conv=osync
argument to
.Xr dd 1 .
Note that this argument is incompatible with the
.Li bs=
argument. Consult the tape-related manual pages on the
system where the tapes are created for more details.
