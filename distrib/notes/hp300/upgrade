It is possible to easily upgrade your existing
.Nx*M
system
using the upgrade program in the miniroot. If you wish to upgrade
your system by this method, simply select the
.Sy upgrade
option once the miniroot has booted.
The upgrade program with then guide you through the procedure.
The upgrade program will:
.(enum
Enable the network based on your system's current
network configuration.
.It
Mount your existing file systems.
.It
Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.
.It
Fixup your system's existing
.Pa /etc/fstab ,
changing the occurrences of
.Sy ufs
to
.Sy ffs
and let you edit the resulting file.
.It
Make new device nodes in your root file system under
.Pa /dev .
.It
Don't forget to extract the
.Sy kern
set from the distribution.
.(Note
The existing kernel
.Em will not
be backed up; doing so would be pointless, since older kernels may not be
capable of running
.Nx \*V executables.
.Note)
.It
Install a new boot block.
.It
Check your file systems for integrity.
.enum)
.Pp
While using the miniroot's upgrade program is the preferred method
of upgrading your system, it is possible to upgrade your system
manually. To do this, follow the following procedure:
.(enum
Place
.Em at least
the
.Sy base
binary set in a file system
accessible to the target machine. A local file system
is preferred, since the NFS subsystem in the
.Nx \*V
kernel may be incompatible with your old binaries.
.It
Back up your pre-existing kernel and copy the \*V
kernel into your root partition
.Pq Pa / .
.It
Reboot with the \*V kernel into single-user mode.
.It
Check all file systems:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/sbin/fsck -pf"
.It
Mount all local file systems:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "/sbin/mount -a -t nonfs"
.It
If you keep
.Pa /usr
or
.Pa /usr/share
on an NFS server, you will want to mount those file systems as well.
To do this, you will need to enable the network:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "sh /etc/rc.d/network start"
.It
Run the
.Xr update 8
daemon, to ensure that new programs
are actually stored on disk.
.\" XXX: this exist anymore?
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "update"
.It
Make sure you are in the root file system
.Pq Pa /
and extract
the
.Sy base
binary set:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd /"
.Dl # Ic "pax -zrvpe -f " Ar /path/to/ Ns Ic base.tgz"
.It
Install a new boot block:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd /usr/mdec"
.ie r_hp300 \{\
.Dl # Ic "disklabel -B Ar root-disk"
E.g.:
.Ar root-disk
could be
.Li sd0 .
.\}
.el \{\
.Dl # Ic "cp bootsd /.bootsd"
.Dl # Ic "./installboot /.bootsd bootxx \*< Ar root-disk"
.Pp
E.g.:
.Ar root-disk
could be
.Pa /dev/rsd0a .
.\}
.It
Sync the file systems:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic sync
.It
At this point you may extract any other binary sets
you may have placed on local file systems, or you may
wish to extract additional sets at a later time.
To extract these sets, use the following commands:
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "cd /"
.Dl # Ic "pax -zrvpe -f Ar path_to_set"
.enum)
.(Note
You
.Em should not
extract the
.Sy etc
set if upgrading. Instead, you should extract that set into another
area and carefully merge the changes by hand.
