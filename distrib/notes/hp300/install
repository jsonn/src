The miniroot's install program is very simple to use.  It will guide
you through the entire process, and is well automated.  Additional
improvements are planned for future releases.

The miniroot's install program will:

	* Allow you to place disklabels on additional disks.
	  Note that partition sizes and offsets are expressed
	  in sectors.

	* Create filesystems on target partitions.

	* Allow you to set up your system's network configuration.
	  Remember to specify host names without the domain name
	  appended to the end.  For example use `foo' instead of
	  `foo.bar.org'.  If, during the process of configuring
	  the network interfaces, you make a mistake, you will
	  be able to re-configure that interface by simply selecting
	  it for configuration again.

	* Mount target filesystems.  You will be given the opportunity
	  to manually edit the resulting /etc/fstab.

	* Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.

	* Copy configuration information gathered during the
	  installation process to your root filesystem.

	* Make device nodes in your root filesystem.

	* Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.

	* Install a new boot block.

	* Check your filesystems for integrity.

First-time installation on a system through a method other than the
installation program is possible, but strongly discouraged.
