NetBSD/sparc64 \*V runs on the following classes of machines:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.	It
Sbus-based UltraSPARC systems (the Ultra1, Ultra1E, Ultra2, Ultra2E)
.	It
PCI-based UltraSPARC systems (known to work on the Ultra5, Ultra10, Ultra30
and Ultra250, and may work on many other systems)
.El
.Pp
NetBSD/sparc64 \*V does
.Em not
run on these machines (yet):
.Bl -bullet -compact
.	It
Enterprise Systems (Ex000, E10000)
.El
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 16M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (NetBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)
.Pp
Supported devices include:
.Bd -literal
	Ethernet devices:
		- Sbus LANCE ethernet (le) [*]
		- Sbus HME ethernet (hme) [*]
		- Sbus BigMac ethernet (be) [*]
		- PCI HME ethernet (hme)
		- PCI Tulip (tlp)
	Video devices:
		- Sbus cgsix
	SCSI host controllers:
		- ncr53c9x based controllers (esp)
		- ncr53c8xx based controllers (siop)
		- ISP10x0 based controllers (isp)
		- Adaptec AHA-2x4x[U][2][W] cards and onboard PCI designs
		using the AIC-7770, AIC-7850, AIC-7860, AIC-7870,
		AIC-7880 and AIC-789x chipsets.
	PCI IDE host controllers:
		- CMD Tech PCI064[3689] IDE Controllers (pciide) [**]
	Serial devices:
		- Sbus z8530 serial (zs)
	Parallel devices:
		- Sbus parallel ports (bpp)
		- PCI/Ebus parallel ports (lpt)
.El
There are a large number of untested PCI drivers that have never
been tested on UltraSPARC PCI systems, that may "just work".
.Pp
[*] Sbus ethernet drivers current have a problem with interrupts and
do not perform properly except in extreme low usage conditions, rendering
them effectively unusable.
.Pp
[**]
Access to devices on the secondary PCIIDE channel currently do not work.
.Pp
Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get questions
about:
.Bl -literal
	Floppy drives
	Audio devices:
		- Sbus & PCI based system audio (audiocs)
	Serial devices:
		- PCI based systems (sab)
	Keyboard & Mouse devices:
		- PCI based systems
	Video devices:
		- Creator3D framebuffers (ffb)
		- General PCI VGA support
	SCSI host controllers:
		- ESP366 based controllers found in Ultra1E and Ultra2
		  systems (esp)
