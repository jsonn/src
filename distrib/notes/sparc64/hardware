The minimal configuration requires 16 MB of RAM and ~60 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx
with 16 MB of RAM feels like
.Tn Solaris
with 16 MB of RAM - slow.
Note that until you have around 16 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.

Sbus ethernet drivers current have a problem with interrupts and
do not perform properly except in extreme low usage conditions, rendering
them effectively unusable.
XXX: is this now fixed?

Access to devices on the secondary PCIIDE channel currently do not work.
