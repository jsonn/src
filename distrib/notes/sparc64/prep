Before you start you might need to consider your disk configuration
to sort out a quirk in SCSI-ID to SD-UNIT mapping that exists on
.Tn Sun
SPARCstations.
.Pp
.\" XXX: is the following true for sparc64?
Upon leaving the factory,
.Tn SunOS
and the OpenBoot PROM map according to
this table:
.Bl -column -offset indent SCSI-ID SunOS\ SD-Unit
.It Tn Em SCSI-ID Ta Tn Em SunOS\ SD-Unit
.It \~\~\~0 Ta \~\~\~sd3
.It \~\~\~1 Ta \~\~\~sd1
.It \~\~\~2 Ta \~\~\~sd2
.It \~\~\~3 Ta \~\~\~sd0
.It \~\~\~4 Ta \~\~\~sd4
.It \~\~\~5 Ta \~\~\~sd5
.It \~\~\~6 Ta \~\~\~sd6
.El
.Pp
Unlike
.Tn SunOS
and the OpenBoot PROM, a
.Li GENERIC
.Nx
kernel numbers
SCSI drives sequentially as it finds them.  The drive with the
lowest SCSI-ID will be called
.Li sd0 ,
the next one
.Li sd1 ,
etc.
.Pp
A truly generic
.Nx
kernel is also provided as
.Pa /netbsd.GENERIC ,
which will do the standard
.Nx
probe ordering. If your configuration
differs from the default
.Tn Sun
setup, you can try to use this kernel to
complete the installation.
.Pp
.(Note
This is also a concern when you start building your own customised kernels.
.Note)
.Pp
You cannot use the security modes of the SPARC OpenBoot PROM.
.Pp
.Dl ok Ic "setenv security-mode none"
.Pp
If you're installing
.Nx*M
for the first time it's a good idea
to look at the partition sizes of disk you intend installing
.Nx
on.
.Pp
Asumming a classic partition scheme with
.Pa /
(root) and
.Pa /usr
file systems, a comfortable size for the
.Nx
.Pa /
partition is about 20 MB;
a good initial size for the swap partition is twice the amount of physical
memory in your machine (though, unlike
.Tn SunOS
4.x, there are no restrictions
on the size of the swap partition that would render part of your memory
unusable). A full binary installation including X11R6 takes about 150 MB in
.Pa /usr .
.Pp
Some network devices (i.e. certain SBus cards)
allow a choice between operating on a UTP or a AUI port. The
.Li le
driver supports automatic detection of the port which is actually connected to
the wire.
If automatic detection is not available or not working properly in your
environment, you may have to specify the type connection using the
.Ar media
parameter of
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
During installation, you'll get the
opportunity to specify the appropriate medium. Use
.Li 10base5/AUI
to select the AUI connector, or
.Li 10baseT/UTP
to select the UTP connector.
