Before you start you might need to consider your disk configuration
to sort out a quirk in SCSI-ID to SD-UNIT mapping that exists on
Sun Sparcstations.
.Pp
Upon leaving the factory, SunOS and the OpenBOOT ROM map according to
this table:
.Bl -column -offset indent SCSI-ID SunOS\ SD-Unit
.It Tn Em SCSI-ID Ta Tn Em SunOS\ SD-Unit
.It \~\~\~0 Ta \~\~\~sd3
.It \~\~\~1 Ta \~\~\~sd1
.It \~\~\~2 Ta \~\~\~sd2
.It \~\~\~3 Ta \~\~\~sd0
.It \~\~\~4 Ta \~\~\~sd4
.It \~\~\~5 Ta \~\~\~sd5
.It \~\~\~6 Ta \~\~\~sd6
.El
.Pp
Unlike SunOS and the OpenBOOT ROM, a generic NetBSD kernel numbers
scsi drives sequentially as it finds them.  The drive with the
lowest scsi-id will be called sd0, the next one sd1, etc.
.Pp
A truly generic NetBSD kernel is also provided as `/netbsd.GENERIC',
which will do the standard NetBSD probe ordering. If your configuration
differs from the default Sun setup, you can try to use this kernel to
complete the installation.
.Pp
.(Note
This is also a concern when you start building your own customised kernels.
.Note)
.Pp
You cannot use the security modes of the sparc OpenBOOT ROM.
.Dl ok Ic setenv security-mode none
.Pp
If you're installing NetBSD/sparc64 for the first time it's a good idea
to look at the partition sizes of disk you intend installing NetBSD on.
.Pp
Asumming a classic partition scheme with root (`/') and /usr filesystems,
a comfortable size for the NetBSD root filesystem partition is about 20MB;
a good initial size for the swap partition is twice the amount of physical
memory in your machine (though, unlike SunOS 4.x, there are no restrictions
on the size of the swap partition that would render part of your memory
unusable). A full binary installation including X11R6 takes about 150MB
in `/usr'.
