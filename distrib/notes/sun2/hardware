\*V runs on Multibus Sun2 machines, including:

The minimal configuration requires 4 MB of RAM and about 130 MB of disk
space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space
(approx. 100 MB additional space is necessary for full sources).
To compile the system, more RAM is recommended.
Good performance requires 7 MB of RAM.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bl -column -offset indent Partition Suggested Needed
.It Partition Ta Suggested Ta Needed
.It /\ (root) Ta "20 MB"   Ta "15 MB"
.It /usr      Ta "210 MB"  Ta "110 MB"
.It /var      Ta "20 MB"   Ta "5 MB"
.It swap      Ta Em 2*RAM \&...
.El
.(item -offset indent
Anything else is up to you!
.item)
.Pp
As you may note, the recommended size of
.Pa /usr
is 100 MB greater than
needed.
This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel.
.Li ( GENERIC
is large and bulky to accommodate all people).
.Pp
Note that the \*M installation procedure uses a
.Em miniroot
image
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.
The swap partition must be at least as large as the miniroot image (12 MB).
