.
.Nx \*V
is the seventh major release for the \*M.
.Pp
Some (but not all!) notable \*M-specific improvements include:
.(bullet
A longstanding sun4c MMU bug has been squashed.  sun4c models should be 
more stable and SPARCstation 1, SPARCstation 1+, and Sun IPC models should
run substantially faster.
.It
Enable support for DHCP net booting in the standard kernels,
and try bootp/DHCP before bootparams during net booting.
.It
Support for Sun 4/400 machines.
.It
Provide 32-bit sun4u (UltraSPARC) kernels.
.It
Support inter-processor interrupts and DDB on SMP systems.
.bullet)
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
