Installing
.Nx
is a relatively complex process, but if you have
this document in hand it shouldn't be too much trouble.
.Pp
There are several ways to install
.Nx
onto a disk. The easiest way is to use the 'miniroot.fs' image copied to
your local disk's swap partition.
Alternatively, if your Sparcstation is hooked up in a network you
can find a server and arrange for a diskless setup which is a
convenient way to install on a machine whose disk does not currently
hold a usable operating system (see the section `Installing
.Nx
by using a diskless setup' below).  Also available is
a two-disk bootable 1.44 MB floppy image set that can be used to boot into
the miniroot environment.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using the NetBSD miniroot
.
The miniroot is a self-contained
.Nx
filesystem holding all utilities
necessary to install
.Nx
on a local disk. It is distributed as a plain
file designed to be transferred to a raw disk partition from which it can
be booted using the appropriate PROM command. Usually, the miniroot will
be loaded into the swap partition of a disk. If needed, you can use any
other unused partition, but remember that in the case of 'miniroot.fs'
the partition will then not available during the installation process.
.Pp
Loading the miniroot onto your raw partition is simple. On
.Nx
as well as SunOS you use a command like:
.Dl # Ic dd if=miniroot.fs of=/dev/rsd0b bs=4k conv=sync
(Here, `/dev/rsd0b' is assumed to be your swap partition.) There's a
potential problem here if /dev/rsd0b is actually in use as a swap
partition by your currently running system. If you don't have another
disk or partition to spare, you can usually get away with running this
command anyway after first booting into single-user mode to ensure a
quiet system.
.Pp
After transferring the miniroot to disk, bring the system down by:
.Dl # Ic halt
.Pp
Then boot the miniroot by typing the appropriate command at the PROM:
.Dl \*> Ic "b sd(,,1)netbsd -s            # for sun4 monitors
.Dl ok Ic "boot sd(,,1)netbsd -s        # for version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
.Dl ok Ic "boot disk:b netbsd -s        # for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs
.Pp
If you've loaded the miniroot onto some other disk than `sd0' adapt
the boot specifier accordingly, e.g.:
.Dl ok Ic boot disk1:b netbsd -s
to boot from SCSI disk target 1 from a version 2 OpenBOOT ROM.
If you have to use the old-style
.Ic sd( Ns Ar c,u,p Ns Ic \&)
syntax to boot from a
SCSI disk, you can calculate the parameters as follows:
.(tag xcc
.It Ar c
specifies the controller number
.It Ar u
the hexadecimal number obtained from evaluating
the expression `(8 * TARGET) + LUN'
.It Ar p
the partition number from which to boot (0=`a', 1=`b', etc).
.tag)
.Pp
The monitor boot command will cause the
.Nx
kernel contained in the
miniroot image to be booted. After the initial probe messages you'll be
asked to start the install or upgrade procedure. Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts.
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using the bootable floppy
.
The
.Nx
install floppy works only on the sun4c and sun4m class.
Making the install floppy is simple:
.Pp
Get two formatted floppy disks. If you have unformatted disks you can
run the
.Xr fdformat 8
program that comes with
.Nx
as well as SunOS. Use the following command:
.Dl # Ic "fdformat"
.Pp
Make sure that the `fdformat' command completes successfully before proceeding
to with the next step; on
.Nx
, a string of all `V's, and on SunOS, a string of
all `.'s.
Alternatively, you can use almost any PC to format your floppy disks.
.Pp
Next, transfer the floppy images onto the floppy disks:
.Dl # Ic "insert the first disk"
.Dl # Ic "gunzip boot.fs.gz"
.Dl # Ic "dd if=boot.fs of=/dev/rfd0a bs=36k"
.Dl # Ic "eject floppy"
Label this disk
.Dq NetBSD bootfs .
.Pp
.Dl # Ic "insert the first disk"
.Dl # Ic "dd if=instfs.tgz of=/dev/rfd0a bs=36k"
.Dl # Ic "eject floppy"
Label this disk
.Dq NetBSD instfs .
.Pp
You can also accomplish this task on a Windows system by using the
.Nm rawrite.exe
command provided with the NetBSD/i386 install tools.
.Pp
Insert the disk labeled
.Dq NetBSD bootfs
into the floppy drive of the target system.
From the OpenBOOT prompt, the following should boot the system from the floppy.
.Dl ok Ic "boot fd(,,1)                 # Version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
.Dl ok Ic "boot /fd                     # or
.Dl ok Ic "boot floppy                  # Version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs
.Pp
After the initial probe messages you'll be asked to insert the disk labeled
.Dq NetBSD instfs
into the drive. After the installation tools from the second disk have
been loaded, you will be asked to start the install or upgrade procedure.
Proceed to the section
.Sx Running the installation scripts
below.
.
.Ss2 Installing NetBSD by using a diskless setup
.
First, you must setup a diskless client configuration on a server. If
you are using a
.Nx
system as the boot-server, have a look at the
.Xr diskless 8
manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, you'll have to consult
documentation that came with it. (On SunOS systems, add_client(8) is a
good start.)
.Pp
Your Sparcstation expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RevARP when
instructed to boot "over the net". It will look for a filename composed of
the machine's IP address followed by the machine's architecture, separated
by a period. For example, a sun4c machine which has been assigned IP
address 130.115.144.11, will make an TFTP request for `8273900B.SUN4C'.
Normally, this file is a symbolic link to an appropriate second-stage
boot program, which should be located in a place where the TFTP daemon
can find it (remember, many TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).
You can find the boot program in
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot.net
in the
.Nx*M
distribution.
.(Note
The only difference between
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot.net No and Pa /usr/mdec/boot
is in the a.out header, which has been magically
transformed in a way that makes it usable on all versions of Sparc PROMs.
.Note)
.Pp
After the boot program has been loaded into memory and given control by
the PROM, it starts locating the machine's remote root directory through
the BOOTPARAM protocol. First a BOOTPARAM WHOAMI request is broadcast
on the local net. The answer to this request (if it comes in) contains
the client's name. This name is used in next step, a BOOTPARAM GETFILE
request -- sent to the server that responded to the WHOAMI request --
requesting the name and address of the machine that will serve the client's
root directory, as well as the path of the client's root on that server.
.Pp
Finally, this information (if it comes in) is used to issue a REMOTE MOUNT
request to the client's root filesystem server, asking for an NFS file
handle corresponding to the root filesystem. If successful, the boot
program starts reading from the remote root filesystem in search of the
kernel which is then read into memory.
.Pp
As noted above in the section
.Pa Preparing your System for NetBSD Installation
you have several options when choosing a location to store the installation
filesets. However, the easiest way is to put the
.Pa *.tar.gz
files you want
to install into the root directory for your client on the server.
.Pp
.ie 0 \{\
.\" section commented out because netbsd.ram.gz is no longer self-contained
Next you must select whether to use the easier 'sysinst' or more flexible
script based install.
.
.Ss2 Diskless sysinst installation
.
Follow this section and skip the next if you wish to use the easier 'sysinst'
installation method.
.Pp
Copy the installation/bootfs/netbsd.ram.gz image into the exported
root directory for your machine, then boot your workstation from the
server by entering the appropriate `boot' command at the monitor prompt.
Depending on the PROM version in your machine, this command takes one of
the following forms:
.Dl "\*> b le()netbsd.ram.gz             # for sun4 monitors
.Dl "ok boot le()netbsd.ram.gz           # for version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
.Dl "ok boot net netbsd.ram.gz           # for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs
.Pp
This will boot the
.Nx
kernel in single-user mode.
.(Note
The latter two examples assume you operate the OpenBOOT ROM in
"new command mode". If your machine comes up and gives you a `\*>' prompt
instead of `ok', type:
.Dl "\*>n                                  # enter native OpenBOOT mode
.Dl "ok setenv sunmon-compat? false      # make it permanent
.Dl "ok
.Note)
.
.\}
.Ss2 Diskless script installation
.
.ie 0 \{\
Follow this section and skip the previous if you wish to use the more
flexible 'miniroot' script installation method.
.Pp
.\}
Unpack `base.tar.gz', `etc.tar.gz', and 'kern.tgz' on the server in
the root directory for your machine. If you elect to use a separately
NFS-mounted filesystem for `/usr' with your diskless setup, make sure the
"./usr" base files in base.tar.gz end up in the correct location. One way
to do this is to temporarily use a loopback mount on the server, re-routing
.Ar root Ns Pa /usr
to your server's exported
.Nx
.Pa /usr
directory. Also put 'install.*' and 'upgrade.sh' from the
.Pa installation/netboot/
directory into the root directory.
.Pp
A few configuration files need to be edited:
.(tag indent
.It Ar root Ns Pa /etc/hosts
Add the IP addresses of both server and client.

.It Ar root Ns Pa /etc/myname
This files contains the client's hostname; use the same
name as in \*<root\*>/etc/hosts.

.It Ar root Ns Pa /etc/fstab
Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
For example:
.Dl server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
.Dl server:/export/exec/sun4.netbsd  /usr  nfs  rw 0 0
.tag)
.Pp
Now you must populate the `/dev' directory for your client. If your server
runs SunOS 4.x, you can simply change your working directory to
.Ar root Ns Pa /dev
and run the MAKEDEV script:
.Ic sh MAKEDEV all .
.Pp
On SunOS 5.x systems, MAKEDEV can also be used, but there'll be error
messages about unknown user and groups. These errors are inconsequential
for the purpose of installing
.Nx .
However, you may want to correct them
if you plan to use the diskless setup regularly. In that case, you may re-run
MAKEDEV on your
.Nx
machine once it has booted.
.Pp
If you to use the server setup for installation purposes only, then you
may create a considerably smaller client filesystem by unpacking
`instfs.tgz' (found in the `installation/bootfs' distribution directory)
into your client's NFS root directory instead of using `base.tar.gz'
and `etc.tar.gz'. You still need 'kern.tgz' to extract a kernel,
since `instfs.tgz' does not contain one.
.Pp
Boot your workstation from the server by entering the appropriate `boot'
command at the monitor prompt. Depending on the PROM version in your machine,
this command takes one of the following forms:
.Dl "\*> b le()netbsd -s               # for sun4 monitors
.Dl "ok boot le()netbsd -s           # for version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs
.Dl "ok boot net netbsd -s           # for version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs
.Pp
This will boot the
.Nx
kernel in single-user mode.
.(Note
The latter two examples assume you operate the OpenBOOT ROM in
"new command mode". If your machine comes up and gives you a `\*>' prompt
instead of `ok', type:
.Dl "\*>n                                  # enter native OpenBOOT mode
.Dl "ok setenv sunmon-compat? false      # make it permanent
.Dl "ok
.Note)
.Pp
If you use a diskless setup with a separately NFS-mounted /usr filesystem,
mount
.Pa /usr
by hand now:
.Dl netbsd# Ic mount /usr
.Pp
.(Note
the text editor provided nu the miniroot is
.Xr vi 1 .
.Note)
When using
.Xr disklabel 8
to edit disklabels the -e switch will invoke the editor on the
label.  The -i switch will run an interactive session.
.Pp
At this point, it's worth checking the disk label and partition sizes on
the disk you want to install
.Nx
onto.
.Nx
understands SunOS-style
disklabels, so if your disk was previously used by SunOS there will be
a usable label on it. Use `disklabel -e \*<disk\*>' or `disklabel -i
\*<disk\*>' (where \*<disk\*> is the device name assigned by the
.Nx
kernel, e.g. `sd0') to view and modify the partition sizes. See
the section
.Sx Preparing your System for NetBSD Installation
above for suggestions about disk partition sizes.
.Pp
If you are installing on a SCSI disk that does
.Em not
have a SunOS or
.Nx
label on it, you may still be able to use disklabel(8) but you'll
have to create all partitions from scratch. If your disk is listed in
`/etc/disktab', you may use the entry (which in most cases only defines
a `c' partition to describe the whole disk) to put an initial label on
the disk. Then proceed with `disklabel -e \*<disk\*>' or `disklabel -i
\*<disk\*>' to create a partition layout that suits your needs.
.(Note
Because of the built-in compatibility with SunOS-style labels,
.Em Always make sure all your partitions
.Em start and end on cylinder boundaries.
.Note)
.Pp
Here follows an example of what you'll see while in the dislabel editor.
Do not touch any of the parameters except for the `label: ' entry and
the actual partition size information at the bottom (the lines starting
with `a:', `b:', ...).
.Pp
The size and offset fields are given in sector units. Be sure to make
these numbers multiples of the of the number of sectors per cylinder:
the kernel might be picky about these things, but aside from this you'll
have the least chance of wasting disk space.
Partitions on which you intend to have a mountable filesystem, should
be given fstype `4.2BSD'. Remember, the `c' partition should describe
the whole disk.
The `(Cyl. x - y)' info that appears after the hash (`#') character is
treated as a comment and need not be filled in when altering partitions.
.(Note
The line containing `8 partitions:' is best left alone,
even if you define less then eight partitions. If this line displays
a different number and the program complains about it (after you leave
the editor), then try setting it to `8 partitions:'.

If you are upgrading a

else, start the installation script:

.
.Ss2 Running the installation scripts
.
The installation system will do most of the work of transferring the
system from the distribution sets onto your disk. You will frequently be
asked for confirmation before the system proceeds with each phase of the
installation process.
.Pp
Note: the
.Ox
miniroot also supports the use of the experimental
full-screen installation program
.Dq sysinst .
To use sysinst instead of the default installtion script, follow the
on-screen instruction that is displayed after the miniroot has started.
.Pp
Occasionally, you will have to provide a piece of information such as the
name of the disk you want to install on or IP addresses and domain names
you want to assign. If your system has more than one disk, you may want
to look at the output of the dmesg(8) command to see how your disks
have been identified by the kernel.
.Pp
The installation script goes through the following phases:
.(bullet -compact
determination of the disk on to install
.Nx
.It
checking of the partition information on the disk
.It
creating and mounting the
.Nx
filesystems
.It
setup of IP configuration
.It
extraction of the distribution tar files
.It
installation of boot programs
.bullet)
.Pp
Now try a reboot.  Initially I'd suggest you "boot sd()netbsd -bs", then
try multiuser after that. If you boot single-user the
.Nx
incantation to make the root filesystem writable is
.Dl netbsd# Ic mount -u /dev/sd0a /
The Sun monitor might have been setup to instruct the boot program to load
a file called "vmunix". On OpenBOOT ROM systems you can change it to load
"netbsd" instead using the following commands:
.Pp
On version 1 OpenBOOT ROMs:
.Dl \*>n
.Dl ok Ic setenv boot-from sd(0,0,0)netbsd
.Dl ok
.Pp
On version 2 OpenBOOT ROMs:
.Dl ok Ic setenv boot-file netbsd
.Dl ok Ic setenv boot-device /sbus/esp/sd@0,0
.Pp
.Em Congratulations ,
you have successfully installed
.Nx \*V.
