.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4 MB of RAM and ~60 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx
with 4 MB of RAM feels like
.Tn Solaris
with 4 MB of RAM - slow.
Note that until you have around 16 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.

.(Note
Non-Sun SCSI CD-ROMs may have trouble booting any OS,
.Nx
or otherwise.  Your CD-ROM must support 512 byte blocks for the OpenBoot PROM
to load a file.  Most newer CD-ROM drives support this automatically, and 
many older drives allow you to set it using a jumper.  See

There is a byte endian issue which
