This program is designed to help you upgrade your NetBSD system in a
simple and rational way.

As a reminder, installing the `etc' binary set is NOT recommended.
Once the rest of your system has been upgraded, you should manually
merge any changes to files in the `etc' set into those files which
already exist on your system.

As with anything which modifies your hard disk's contents, this
program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised
to make sure your hard drive is backed up before beginning the
installation process.

Default answers are displyed in brackets after the questions.
You can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a
prompt, you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.

CONGRATULATIONS!  You have successfully upgraded NetBSD!  To boot the
installed system, enter halt at the command prompt.  Once the system has
halted, power-cycle the machine in order to load new boot code.  Make sure
you boot from the root disk.
