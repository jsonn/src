This program is designed to help you put NetBSD on your hard disk,
in a simple and rational way.  You'll be asked several questions,
and it would probably be useful to have your disk's hardware
manual, the installation notes, and a calculator handy.

In particular, you will need to know some reasonably detailed
information about your disk's geometry.  This program can determine
some limited information about certain specific types of HP-IB disks.
If you have SCSI disks, however, prior knowledge of disk geometry
is absolutely essential.

As with anything which modifies your hard disk's contents, this
program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised
to make sure your hard drive is backed up before beginning the
installation process.

Default answers are displyed in brackets after the questions.
You can hit Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a
prompt, you may have to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of
installation may leave your system in an inconsistent state.

You may wish to edit the fstab.  For example, you may need to resolve
dependencies in the order which the filesystems are mounted.  You may
also wish to take this opportunity to place NFS mounts in the fstab.
This would be especially useful if you plan to keep '/usr' on an NFS
server.
