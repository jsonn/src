.Sh NAME
.Nm iscsifs
.Nd refuse-based iSCSI initiator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46bcfvV
.Op Fl a Ar authentication-type
.Op Fl d Ar digest-type
.Op Fl h Ar target-hostname
.Op Fl p Ar target-port-number
.Op Fl t Ar target-number
.Op Fl u Ar username
.Ar mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to access an iSCSI target, such as
.Xr iscsi-target 8 ,
to access block storage which has been exported.
The 
.Nm
utility makes use of the
.Xr virtdir 3
virtual directory routines.
Information pertaining to the target is displayed underneath
the mount point, along with the device corresponding
to the storage which the target exports.
.Pp
The various arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Use an IPv4 connection to the target
.It Fl 6
Use an IPv6 connection to the target
.It Fl a Ar authentication-type
Use the specified authentication type when communicating with the target.
The possible values are chap, kerberos, srp or none.
The default value is none.
.It Fl b
Show the storage as a block device
.It Fl c
Show the storage as a character device
.It Fl d Ar digest-type
Use the specified digest type when communicating with the target.
The possible values are header, data, both, all or none.
The default value is none.
.It Fl f
Show the storage as a regular file
.It Fl h Ar hostname
Connect to the iSCSI target running on the host specified as the argument.
.It Fl p Ar port-number
Connect to the iSCSI target running on the port specified as the argument.
The default value is 3260.
.It Fl t Ar target
Connect to the number of the iSCSI target running as the argument.
.It Fl u Ar username
Use the specified user's credentials when logging in to the iSCSI target.
There is no default.
.It Fl v
Be verbose in operation
.It Fl V
Print out the version number and then exit.
.El
.Pp
The
.Xr refuse 3
library is used to provide the file system features.
.Pp
The mandatory parameter is
the local mount
point.
.Pp
This iSCSI initiator presents a view of the targets underneath the
mount point.
Firstly, it creates a directory tree with the hostname of the target,
and, in that directory, a virtual directory is created for each
target name exported by the iSCSI target program.
Within that virtual target directory, symbolic links exist for 
the hostname (for convenience),
a textual representation of the IP address,
the iSCSI target product name,
the iSCSI target IQN,
the iSCSI target vendor and version number.
One other directory entry is presented in the virtual target
directory, relating to the storage presented by the iSCSI target.
This can be in the form of a regular file, which is also the
default, a block device or a character device.
