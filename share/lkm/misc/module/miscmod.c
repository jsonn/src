/*
 * External entry point; should generally match name of .o file.  The
 * arguments are always the same for all loaded modules.  The "load",
 * "unload", and "stat" functions in "DISPATCH" will be called under
 * their respective circumstances unless their value is "nosys".  If
 * called, they are called with the same arguments (cmd is included to
 * allow the use of a single function, ver is included for version
 * matching between modules and the kernel loader for the modules).
 *
 * Since we expect to link in the kernel and add external symbols to
 * the kernel symbol name space in a future version, generally all
 * functions used in the implementation of a particular module should
 * be static unless they are expected to be seen in other modules or
 * to resolve unresolved symbols alread existing in the kernel (the
 * second case is not likely to ever occur).
 *
 * The entry point should return 0 unless it is refusing load (in which
 * case it should return an errno from errno.h).
