 * called, they are called with the same arguments (cmd is included to
 * allow the use of a single function, ver is included for version
 * matching between modules and the kernel loader for the modules).

 * Since we expect to link in the kernel and add external symbols to

 * be static unless they are expected to be seen in other modules or
 * to resolve unresolved symbols already existing in the kernel (the
