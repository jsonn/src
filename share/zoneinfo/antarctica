#
# From Ethan Dicks <erd@mcmsun5.mcmurdo.gov> (1996-10-06):
# It keeps the same time as Punta Arenas, Chile, because, just like us
# and the South Pole, that's the other end of their supply line....
# I verified with someone who was there that since 1980,
# Palmer has followed Chile.  Prior to that, before the Falklands War,
# Palmer used to be supplied from Argentina.

# Amundsen-Scott, South Pole, since 1957-01-23
# From Paul Eggert (1996-09-03):
# Normally it wouldn't have a separate entry, since it's like the
# larger Antarctica/McMurdo since 1970, but it's too famous to omit.
#
# From Chris Carrier <72157.3334@CompuServe.COM> (1996-06-27):
# Siple, the first commander of the South Pole station,
# stated that he would have liked to have kept GMT at the station,
# but that he found it more convenient to keep GMT+12
# as supplies for the station were coming from McMurdo Sound,
# which was on GMT+12 because New Zealand was on GMT+12 all year
# at that time (1957).  (Source: Siple's book 90 degrees SOUTH.)
#
# From Susan Smith
# http://www.cybertours.com/whs/pole10.html
# (1995-11-13 16:24:56 +1300, no longer available):
# We use the same time as McMurdo does.
# And they use the same time as Christchurch, NZ does....
# One last quirk about South Pole time.
# All the electric clocks are usually wrong.
# Something about the generators running at 60.1hertz or something
# makes all of the clocks run fast.  So every couple of days,
# we have to go around and set them back 5 minutes or so.
# Maybe if we let them run fast all of the time, we'd get to leave here sooner!!
