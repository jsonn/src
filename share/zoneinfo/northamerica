# United States

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1995-12-19):
# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
# It is the source for the US and Puerto Rico entries below.

# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):
# Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
# in his whimsical essay ``Turkey vs Eagle, McCauley is my Beagle'' (1784).
# Not everyone is happy with the results:
#
#	I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
#	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
#	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
#	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
#	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
#	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
#	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
#	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
#	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
#	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.
#
#	-- Robertson Davies, The Diary of Samuel Marchbanks (1947), XIX, Sunday

# From Arthur David Olson:
# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, 1974-10-26
# and Sunday, 1974-10-27 editions of the Washington Post.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# ...Alaska's timezone lines were redrawn in 1983 to give only 2 tz.
#    The YST zone now covers nearly all of the state, AHST just part

#	(none)
# Next, names from 1967-04-01 until 1983-11-30 (the date for
# public law 98-181):
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Yukon standard time
#	Alaska-Hawaii standard time
#	Bering standard time
# And after 1983-11-30:
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Alaska standard time
#	Hawaii-Aleutian standard time
#	Samoa standard time
# The law doesn't give abbreviations.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Shanks uses 1983-10-30, not 1983-11-30, for the 1983 transitions.
# Go with Shanks.

# Indiana
#
# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
#
# Since 1970, EST-only Indiana has been like America/Indianapolis,
# with exceptions noted below for Crawford, Starke, and Switzerland counties.
# The parts of Indiana not listed below have been like America/Chicago,
# America/Louisville, or America/New_York.
#
# Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
# that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the `America' level.
# So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory `America/Indiana'.
#
# Most of EST-only Indiana last observed DST in 1970.

# Michigan
#
# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# Michigan didn't observe DST from 1968 to 1973.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885 Sep 18,
# but Howse (p 126) writes that Detroit kept
#
#	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
#	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
#	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
#	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
#	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
#	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
#	by city vote.
#
# This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
#
# Most of Michigan observed DST from 1973 on, but was a bit late in 1975.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1996-11-22):
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the US is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (4th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1995).
#
# Gwillim Law <LAW@encmail.encompass.com> writes that a good source
# for recent time zone data is the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks is the source for entries through 1990,
# and IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# See the `europe' file for Greenland.

# Ontario, Quebec

# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):
# Shanks writes that since 1970 most of this region has been like Montreal.
# Thunder Bay skipped DST in 1973.
# Many smaller locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1974;
# Nipigon (EST) and Rainy River (CST) are the largest that we know of.
# Far west Ontario is like Winnipeg; far east Quebec is like Halifax.

# From Paul Eggert (1997-10-17):
# msb@sq.com writes that an article in the 1997-10-14 Toronto Star
# says that Atikokan, Ontario currently does not observe DST,
# but will vote on 11-10 whether to use EST/EDT.
# He also writes that the
# <a href="http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/publications/statregs/conttext.html">
# Ontario Time Act (1990, Chapter T.9)
# </a>
# says that Ontario east of 90W uses EST/EDT, and west of 90W uses CST/CDT.
# Officially Atikokan is therefore on CST/CDT, and most likely this report
# concerns a non-official time observed as a matter of local practice.
# For what it's worth, Shanks (1995) says that Atikokan has agreed with
# Rainy River ever since standard time was introduced.

# Saskatchewan

# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):
# Shanks writes that since 1970 most of this region has been like Regina.
# Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
# Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.

# From W. Jones <jones@skdad.usask.ca> (1992-11-06):
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.
#
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
#
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
#
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
# since sometime in the 1960s.

# Northwest Territories, Yukon

# From Paul Eggert (1996-10-07):

# Mathew Englander <mathew@io.org> (1996-10-07) gives the following refs:
#	* 1967. Paragraph 28(34)(g) of the Interpretation Act, S.C. 1967-68,
#	c. 7 defines Yukon standard time as UTC-9.  This is still valid;

#	* C.O. 1973/214 switched Yukon to PST on 1973-10-28 00:00.
#	* O.I.C. 1980/02 established DST.
#	* O.I.C. 1987/056 changed DST to Apr firstSun 2:00 to Oct lastSun 2:00.
# Shanks says Yukon's 1973-10-28 switch was at 2:00; go with Englander.

# Mexico

# From Guy Harris:
# Rules are from the Official Airline Guide, Worldwide Edition, for 1987.
# Rules [before] 1987 are unknown.
# The comments in the OAG say "Only Ensenada, Mexicale, San Felipe and Tijuana
# observe DST."  This is presumably Baja California Norte, above 28th parallel,
# as listed there; [there is also] "Baja California Sur and N. Pacific
# Coast (States of Sinaloa and Sonora)."

# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# The Federal District (where Mexico City is) has observed [DST] several
# times but not recently.
#
# I don't where to drawn the line in the North Baja area.  28th latitude
# sounds good -- but it may be higher (how far [d]o radio stations from
# San Diego affect culture?).
#
# The dates of DST probably go back to 1981.  The rules are the same as
# US's.  This is going to be a headache for US presidential electi[o]n years!

# From Arthur David Olson (1988-02-13)
# Since the 1981 starting date is only "probable," we'll keep the 1987
# starting date below.

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (1989-01-19):
# MEXICO BAJA CAL N   7 H  BEHIND UTC    BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR AND
# MEXICO BAJA CAL N                      N. PACIFIC COAST (STATES
# MEXICO BAJA CAL N                      OF SINALOA AND SONORA)
# MEXICO BAJA CAL N   8 H  BEHIND UTC    ABOVE 28TH PARALLEL APR 3

# MEXICO                                 YUCATAN

# From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-21):
# April 3 fell on a Sunday in 1988; October 29 fell on a Sunday in 1989.  Ahem.
# USNO claims there should be four Mexican zones rather than three:
# a zone that's GMT-8 with DST; a zone that's always GMT-7;
# a zone that's GMT-6 with DST; and a zone that's always GMT-6.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1993-11-18):
# Shanks also says there are four zones, but disagrees about the fourth.
# Instead of GMT-6 with DST, he says there's GMT-8 without DST.

# From Alan Perry <alan.perry@eng.sun.com> (1996-02-15):
# A guy from our Mexico subsidiary finally found the Presidential Decree
# outlining the timezone changes in Mexico.
# 
# ------------- Begin Forwarded Message -------------
# 
# I finally got my hands on the Official Presidential Decree that sets up the
# rules for the DST changes. The rules are:
# 
# 1. The country is divided in 3 timezones:
#    - Baja California Norte (the Mexico/BajaNorte TZ)
#    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)
#    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)
#    
# 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October
#    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+7
#    BajaSur:   GMT+6
#    General:   GMT+5
#    
# 3. The rest of the year, the times are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+8
#    BajaSur:   GMT+7
#    General:   GMT+6
#    
# The Decree was published in Mexico's Official Newspaper on January 4th.
# 
# -------------- End Forwarded Message --------------
# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):
# For an English translation of the decree, see
# <a href="http://mexico-travel.com/extra/timezone_eng.html">
# ``Diario Oficial: Time Zone Changeover'' (1996-01-04).
# </a>

# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):
# The State of Quintana Roo has reverted back to central STD and DST times
# (i.e. UTC -0600 and -0500 as of 1998-08-02).
