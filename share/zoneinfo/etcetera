# These entries are mostly present for historical reasons, so that
# people in areas not otherwise covered by the tz files could "zic -l"
# to a time zone that was right for their area.  These days, the
# tz files cover almost all the inhabited world, so there's little
# need now for the entries that are not on UTC.

# The following link uses older naming conventions,
# but it belongs here, not in the file `backward',
# as functions like gmtime load the "GMT" file to handle leap seconds properly.
# We want this to work even on installations that omit the other older names.

# We use POSIX-style signedness in the names and output,
# internal-style signedness in the specifications.
# For example, TZ=Etc/GMT+4 corresponds to 4 hours _behind_ UTC;
# it is equivalent to TZ=GMT+4, which is implemented directly as per POSIX.

# Earlier incarnations of this package were not POSIX-compliant,
# and had lines such as
#		Zone	GMT-12		-12	-	GMT-1200
# We did not want things to change quietly if someone accustomed to the old
# way does a
#		zic -l GMT-12
# so we moved the names into the Etc subdirectory.
