# Britain (United Kingdom) and Ireland (Eire)
# The UK and its colonies adopted the Gregorian calendar on 1752-09-14.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@memex.co.uk> (1994-07-06):
#
# On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
# historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
# and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
# of the text said:
#
# `An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
# beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
# was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
# this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
# made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
# but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
# along the towpath within a few yards of it.'
#
# I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone's
# position is 51 deg. 28' 30" N, 0 deg. 18' 45" W. The longitude should
# be within about +-2". The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.
#
# [This yields GMTOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1993-11-18):
#
# Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
# The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
# and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
# The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828);
# it was popularized in 1840 by Capt. Basil Hall, RN (1788-1844),
# famed explorer and former Commissioner for Longitude.
# The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
# in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
# (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847 Sep 22 the
# Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
# adopted at all stations; the January 1848 Bradshaw's lists most major
# railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
# clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the Great Clock
# in Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
# one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
# system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading
# to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.
# The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition
# of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880 Aug 2.
#
# In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single
# transition date for London, namely 1847 Sep 22.  We don't know as much
# about Dublin, so we use 1880 Aug 2, the legal transition time.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-01-30):
# Summer Time was first seriously proposed by William Willett (1857-1915),
# a London builder and member of the Royal Astronomical Society
# who circulated a pamphlet ``Waste of Daylight'' (1907)
# that proposed advancing clocks 20 minutes on each of four Sundays in April,
# and retarding them by the same amount on four Sundays in September.
# A bill was drafted in 1909 and introduced in Parliament several times,
# but it met with ridicule and opposition, especially from farming interests.
# One-hour Summer Time was eventually adopted as a wartime measure in 1916.

# From Paul Eggert (1996-09-03):
# The OED Supplement says that the English originally said ``Daylight Saving''
# when they were debating the adoption of DST in 1908; but by 1916 this
# term appears only in quotes taken from DST's opponents, whereas the
# proponents (who eventually won the argument) are quoted as using ``Summer''.

# From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-19):
#
# A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it's
# known as "British" Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.

# Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
# From: Jonathan Leffler <nih-csl!uunet!mcvax!sphinx.co.uk!john>
# [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
# If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
# politics making a fortune, not computing.

# From Chris Carrier <72157.3334@CompuServe.COM> (1996-06-14):
# I remember reading in various wartime issues of the London Times the
# acronym BDST for British Double Summer Time.  Look for the published
# time of sunrise and sunset in The Times, when BDST was in effect, and
# if you find a zone reference it will say, "All times B.D.S.T."

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@aldie.co.uk> (1998-04-19):
# The following list attempts to show the complete history of Summer Time
# legislation in the United Kingdom, and has quite a bit to say about
# the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands as well.
#
# Things that I have not personally seen are marked (???). Things that
# I haven't seen but Joseph Myers has are marked (jsm). The problem
# with finding old Orders (rather than Acts) is that nobody seems to
# keep the actual documents themselves, not even the Government. They
# get bound into annual volumes, which are published, but by the time
# this happens the Orders are mainly spent as the years they refer
# to have come and gone, so they don't get included in the annual
# volumes.
#
# Thanks are due to my learned legal friend Lorna Montgomerie, who dug out
# the dusty old statutes, to Melanie Allison of the Ministry of Defence,
# who provided the wartime regulations and a snippet of Hansard explaining
# why double summer time started on a Monday in 1945 (it was Easter),
# and to Joseph Myers <jsm28@cam.ac.uk>, who tracked down the Orders
# up to 1945, some of the old Acts, and the first five EC Directives.
#
# Some definitions:
#
# Great Britain: England, Scotland and Wales
# United Kingdom: Great Britain plus Ireland (up to 1922) or Northern
# Ireland (since 1922)
# S.I.: Statutory Instrument, the modern name for secondary legislation
# S.R.&O.: Statutory Rules and Orders, the older name for secondary legislation
#
# Unless otherwise specified, Acts and secondary legislation are assumed
# to apply throughout the United Kingdom, but not to the Isle of Man
# or the Channel Islands.
#
# Some of the Acts and Orders I found in various libraries, and I don't
# have copies. When I looked at them I was looking for dates and not things
# like whether they applied to the Bailiwick of Jersey. I will try to
# check these documents again.

#
# - The Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880 (43 & 44 Vict. c. 9)
#
# Defined Greenwich mean time to be the standard time in Great Britain
# and Dublin mean time to be the standard time in Ireland, superseding
# various forms of local mean time.
#
# - The Statutory Time Act, 1883 (???)
#
# An Act of Tynwald, the Isle of Man Parliament. It appears to have
# defined the standard time on the Isle of Man as GMT but as I haven't
# seen it I don't know if it used Greenwich mean time, some other definition,
# or just said that Isle of Man time would be the same as in Great Britain.
#
# - The Isle of Man (War Legislation) Act, 1914 (4 & 5 Geo. 5. c. 62)
#
# Gives the power, by Order in Council, to extend wartime legislation
# to the Isle of Man.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1916 (6 & 7 Geo. 5. c. 14)
#
# Introduced Summer Time for the first time, in Great Britain and Ireland.
# Specified a one hour offset from GMT (DMT in Ireland), dates of
# Sunday 21 May and Sunday 1 October and times of 02:00 (GMT/DMT).
# Gave a power to make Orders in subsequent years, for the duration
# of the then current war.
#
# - The Time (Ireland) Act, 1916 (6 & 7 Geo. 5. c. 45)
#
# This abolished Dublin mean time at 02:00 DMT on Sunday 1 October 1916,
# bringing the whole of the United Kingdom onto GMT. As Ireland was behind
# GMT/BST at 02:00 DMT on 1 Oct Great Britain had already put the clocks back.
# Using Paul Eggert's suggestion of IST for Irish Summer Time and the figure
# derived from Whitman for the offset of IST from GMT (00:34:39) the sequence
# would have been:
# Dublin        London
# 02:34:38 IST  02:59:59 BST
# 02:34:39 IST  02:00:00 GMT
# 02:59:59 IST  02:25:20 GMT
# 02:25:21 GMT  02:25:21 GMT
# with the transition 03:00:00 IST -> 02:00:00 DMT -> 02:25:21 GMT all at once.

# time as it took effect in the United Kingdom.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1917, No. 362
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1916 giving dates

#
# An Order made under the Summer Time (Isle of Man) Act, 1916

#
# - S.R.&O. 1918, No. 274
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1916 giving dates

#
# - The Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act, 1918
#   (8 & 9 Geo. 5. c. 59)
#
# This gave power to specify a legal end date for the war just ended,
# which would affect things like the Summer Time Act, 1916, which applied
# only in wartime. This date was to be close to the date of formal
# ratification of the treaty or treaties of peace.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1919, No. 297
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1916 giving dates
# for Summer Time in 1919 of Sunday 30 March to Monday 29 September,

#
# The matching Isle of Man Order for 1920 with the same dates and times.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1920, No. 1844
#
# An Order modifying both S.R.&O. 1920, No. 458 and S.R.&O. 1920, No. 573 to
# change the end date for Summer Time from Monday 27 September to
# Monday 25 October (the time remaining 02:00 GMT). The 1989 Green
# Paper (Cm 722) says this was done because of a coal strike.
#
# - The War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act, 1920 (10 Geo. 5. c. 5)
#
# This extends the power to make Orders under the Summer Time Act, 1916
# for a period of 12 months after the termination of the war.
# Came into force on 31 March 1920. Although the war had been over for more

# It also mentions the arrangements for defining the legal end date
# for the late war. An Order was made on 10 August 1921, under the
# Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act, 1918, setting
# a date of 31 August 1921. This means the powers of the Summer Time
# Act, 1916 would finally expire on 31 August 1922.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1922, No. 290 (???)
#
# This is probably the matching Isle of Man Order.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1922 (12 & 13 Geo. 5. c. 22)
#
# This specifies an offset of 1 hour and dates of the day after the third
# Saturday in April, unless that be Easter, in which case it is the day after
# the second Saturday, and the day after the third Saturday in September.
# The time is 02:00 GMT. It applied in 1922 and 1923, and longer if Parliament

#
# - S.R.&O. 1922, No. 1205
#

#
# - The Expiring Laws Continuance Act, 1923 (13 & 14 Geo. 5. c. 37)
#
# This extended the Summer Time Act, 1922 (among other things) until

#
# - The Expiring Laws Continuance Act, 1924 (15 Geo. 5. c. 1) (jsm)
#
# This further extended the Summer Time Act, 1922 (among other things) until
# 31 December 1925.
#
# - The Time Act (Northern Ireland), 1924 (14 & 15 Geo. 5. c. 24 (N.I.))
#
# This Act says that while it remains in force, any Act or Order relating
# to the time for general purposes in Great Britain shall also apply
# in Northern Ireland, and the Time (Ireland) Act, 1916 shall have effect
# accordingly.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1925 (15 & 16 Geo. 5. c. 64)
#
# This makes the 1922 Act permanent, with a change to the end date to the

#
# - The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939 (2 & 3 Geo. 6. c. 62) (???)

#
# - The Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939, S.R.&O. 1939, No. 1379
#
# These were made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939.

#
# - S.R.&O. 1940, No. 172

#
# - S.R.&O. 1942, No. 506

#
# I have this quote from Hansard (the official record of the United Kingdom
# Parliament), Oral Answers, 1 March 1945, cols 1559--60, explaining the
# unusual start on a Monday:
#
#  `58. Major Sir Goronwy Owen asked the Secretary of State for the Home
#   Department if he is now able to state the Government's proposals
#   regarding double summer time.
#
#   [two other similar questions omitted]
#
#   Mr. H. Morrison: The Government, in reviewing the matter, have
#   considered, [...] the conclusion has been reached that the adoption of
#   double summer time from the beginning of April is essential to the
#   maintenance of the war effort. [...] As 1st April is Easter Sunday,
#   when very early services are held in many churches, it is proposed that
#   double summer time shall start not in the night preceding Easter
#   Sunday, but in the night of Sunday-Monday so that it will operate from
#   Monday, 2nd April.'
#
# - S.R.&O. 1945, No. 1208
#
# An Order under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, 1939 and 1940 revoking
# a long list of things, including the Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939.
# This meant that Summer Time reverted to being set by the 1922 and 1925 Acts.
# It was made on 28 September, early enough to end Summer Time on the
# date defined by the 1925 Act: 7 October.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6. c. 16)
#
# Came into force on 11 March 1947. Amended the Summer Time Acts, 1922 and
# 1925 to change the dates of Summer Time and to introduce Double Summer Time
# (although it doesn't give this, or any, name for this period of 2 hour
# offset from GMT). Dates are given for 1947 only and are: 02:00 GMT Sunday
# 16 March, 01:00 GMT Sunday 13 April, 01:00 GMT Sunday 10 August, and 02:00
# Sunday 2 November. It gave a power to make Orders for subsequent years,
# both to vary the dates and to continue Double Summer Time. It applied
# to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1948 (S.I. 1948/495)
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1947. Gave dates for 1948 of
# 14 March and 31 October, both at 02:00 GMT.
#

# Another Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1947. Gave dates for 1952
# of 20 April and 26 October, both at 02:00 GMT.
#
# This is the last of this run of Orders, so for 1953 things reverted
# to the 1922 and 1925 Acts.
#
# - The Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland), 1954 (1954 c. 33 (N.I.)) (???)
#
# I presume that section 39 of this Act is similar to section 9 of the

# The first of these specifies dates for 1968 of 18 February for the United
# Kingdom but 7 April for the Isle of Man, both ending on 27 October,
# all at 02:00 GMT. The second Order changes the Isle of Man start date
# to 18 February to match the United Kingdom.
#
# - The British Standard Time Act 1968 (1968 c. 45)
#
# This came into force on 27 October 1968 and continued summer time throughout
# the year. It expired at 02:00 GMT on 31 October 1971, as specified in the
# Act, as Parliament did not move to make this experment permanent.
# It applied to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
#
# Interestingly, it says baldly `This Act shall come into force on
# 27 October 1968', without giving a time. As S1 of the Act merely
# stated that `The time for general purposes in the United Kingdom
# (to be known as British standard time) shall be one hour in
# advance of Greenwich mean time throughout the year; ...' you could
# possibly argue that the start time of BStandardT was 00:00 1968-10-27,
# especially as the Act repealed the Summer Time Acts 1916--1947 in toto,
# thereby destroying the authority of the Summer Time Order specifying
# summer time in 1968.
#
# - The Manx Time Act 1968
#
# This is an Act of Tynwald (the Isle of Man Parliament) that said that
# henceforth Manx time would be the same as the time in Great Britain.
#
# - The Summer Time Act 1972 (1972 c. 6)
#
# This specified a reversion to normal Summer Time behaviour with a start
# date of the day after the third Saturday in March, unless that is Easter,
# when it is the day after the second Saturday, and an end date of the day
# after the fourth Saturday in October. Times are at 02:00 GMT, offset is
# 1 hour. It gives the power to make Orders to vary these dates and
# times. This Act is still in force and is the legal authority for
# implementing the EC Directives in the United Kingdom.
#
# - The Interpretation Act 1978 (1978 c. 30)
#
# Section 9 of this Act replaces section 1 of the Statutes (Definition of
# Time) Act, 1880 with very similar wording maintaining GMT as the legal
# time in Great Britain. This does not apply in Northern Ireland (it
# has its own Interpretation Act listed above).
#
# - Council Directive of 22 July 1980 on summertime arrangements (80/737/EEC)
#
# The first of the European Directives on Summer Time. It specified start
# dates for 1981 and 1982. No agreement had been reached on end dates.
# Only dates were given, there was no rule like `last Sunday in March'.
# The main change for the United Kingdom was a move to a 01:00 GMT change
# time. The dates:
#   1981: 29 March
#   1982: 28 March
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1980 (S.I. 1980/1089)
#
# Specified dates for 1981 and 1982, with the start dates as in the
# EC Directive and all times 01:00 GMT:
#   1981: 29 March to 25 October
#   1982: 28 March to 24 October
#
# - Second Council Directive of 10 June 1982 on summertime arrangements
#   (82/399/EEC)
#
# The next European Directive. Specified dates for three years, 1983 to 1985.
# Agreement still hadn't been reached on a common end date, and wouldn't
# be until 1994 with the appeareance of the seventh Directive with a common
# date for 1996 and beyond, but this time the Directive gave two sets of
# end dates. The start date was specified by rule: the last Sunday in March.
# All times were 01:00 GMT. The end dates were given without rule, as:
#   1983: 25 September or 23 October
#   1984: 30 September or 28 october
#   1985: 29 September or 27 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1982 (S.I. 1982/1673)
#
# Implemented the second EC Directive, using the October end dates.
#   1983: 27 March to 23 October
#   1984: 25 March to 28 october
#   1985: 31 March to 27 October
#
# - Third Council Directive of 12 December 1984 on summertime arrangements
#   (84/634/EEC)
#
# Specified start dates of the last Sunday in March and two sets of end
# dates, last Sunday in September and fourth Sunday in October, all at
# 01:00 GMT. The end dates were also specified as dates:
#   1986: 28 September or 26 October
#   1987: 27 September or 25 October
#   1988: 25 September or 23 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1986 (S.I. 1986/223)
#
# Implemented the third EC Directive, using the October end dates.
#   1986: 30 March to 26 October
#   1987: 29 March to 25 October
#   1988: 27 March to 23 October
#
# - Council Directive of 20 December 1985 amending Directive 84/634/EEC
#   on summertime arrangements (85/582/EEC)
#
# This was to do with the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EEC.
# The previous directve had used wording like `Member States belonging
# to the zero (Greenwich) time zone' when refering to the different
# sets of end dates. Portugal was in that time zone but was not going
# to follow the United Kingdom and Ireland dates, so the text was reworded
# without any change to the dates themselves.
#
# - Fourth Council Directive of 22 December 1987 on summertime arrangements
#   (88/14/EEC)
#
# This Directive covered only a single year: 1989. My guess is that
# this was because 1989 was one of the years when the historic United Kingdom
# end date of the Sunday after the fourth Saturday in October differed from
# the rule in the previous Directive of the fourth Sunday in October.
# All times are 01:00 GMT. No rule was specified, specific dates were given:
#   1989: 26 March to 24 September or 29 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1988 (S.I. 1988/931)
#
# Implemented the dates of 26 March to 29 October for 1989.
#
# - Fifth Council Directive of 21 December 1988 on summertime arrangements
#   (89/47/EEC)
#
# Covered the three years 1990 to 1992. All times are 01:00 GMT. Gave both
# rules (last Sunday in March, last Sunday in September or fourth Sunday
# in October) and specific dates:
#   1990: 25 March to 30 September or 28 October
#   1991: 31 March to 29 September or 27 October
#   1992: 29 March to 27 September or 25 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1989 (S.I. 1989/985)
#
# Implemented the fifth Directive using the October end dates.
#
# - Sixth Council Directive 92/20/EEC of 26 March 1992 on summertime
#   arrangements
#
# Covered the two years 1993 and 1994. All times are 01:00 GMT. Specified
# both rules (same as the fifth Directive) and specific dates:
#   1993: 28 March to 26 September or 24 October
#   1994: 27 March to 25 September or 23 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1992 (S.I. 1992/1729)
#
# Implemented the sixth Directive using the October end dates.
#
# - Seventh Directive 94/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
#   of 30 May 1994 on summer-time arrangements
#
# Covered the three years 1995 to 1997. Agreement had finally been reached
# on a common end date, to start in 1996. Both rules and dates were given.
# The rules were the same last Sunday in March to last Sunday in September
# or fourth Sunday in October for 1995, with the end rule changing to the
# last Sunday in October for 1996 and 1997. The year 1995 was another of
# the tricky ones where the EC and traditional United Kingdom rules differed
# but this time the UK changed on the fourth Sunday, 22 October, earlier
# than usual. All times are 01:00 GMT. Specific dates were also given:
#   1995: 26 March to 24 September or 22 October
#   1996: 31 March to 27 October
#   1997: 30 March to 26 October
#
# - Summer Time Order 1994 (S.I. 1994/2798)
#
# Implements the seventh Directive using the October end date in 1995.
# Applies also to the Bailiwick of Guernsey but not to the Bailiwick of
# Jersey or the Isle of Man, which have their own (unspecified) legislation
# on the subject.
#
# - Eighth Directive 97/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
#   of 22 July 1997 on summer-time arrangements
#
# Covers four years: 1998 to 2001. All times are 01:00 GMT. Specifies both
# rules, last Sunday in March and last Sunday in October, and specific dates:
#   1998: 29 March to 25 October
#   1999: 28 March to 31 October
#   2000: 26 March to 29 October
#   2001: 25 March to 28 October
#
# <a href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/si/si1997/97298201.htm">
# - Summer Time Order 1997 (S.I. 1997/2982)
# </a>
#
# Implements the eighth Directive. Has the same text about the Isle of Man,
# Guernsey and Jersey as the 1994 Order.

# From Joseph S. Myers <jsm28@hermes.cam.ac.uk> (1998-01-06):
#
# The legal time in the UK outside of summer time is definitely GMT, not UTC;
# see Lord Tanlaw's speech
# <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds97/text/70611-20.htm#70611-20_head0">
# (Lords Hansard 11 June 1997 columns 964 to 976)
# </a>.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1996-06-12):
#
# The date `20 April 1924' in the table of ``Summer Time: A
# Consultation Document'' (Cm 722, 1989) table is a transcription error;
# 20 April was an Easter Sunday.  Shanks has 13 April, the correct date.
# Also, the table is not quite right for 1925 through 1938; the correct rules
# (which Shanks uses) are given in the Summer Time Acts of 1922 and 1925.
# Shanks and the UK Government paper disagree about the Apr 1956 transition;
# since we have no other data, and since Shanks was correct in the other
# points of disagreement about London, we'll believe Shanks for now.
# Also, for lack of other data, we'll follow Shanks for Eire in 1940-1948.
#
# Given Peter Ilieve's comments, the following claims by Shanks are incorrect:
#     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight saving time until
#	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.
# Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.
#     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.
# It actually just had one transition.
#     * Northern Ireland used single daylight saving time throughout WW II.
# Actually, it conformed to Britain.
#     * GB-Eire changed standard time to 1 hour ahead of GMT on 1968-02-18.
# Actually, that date saw the usual switch to summer time.
# Standard time was not changed until 1968-10-27 (the clocks didn't change).
#
# The following claims by Shanks are possible though doubtful;
# we'll ignore them for now.
#     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT
#	to daylight saving time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to
#	conform with Great Britain.
#     * Dublin's 1971-10-31 switch was at 02:00, even though London's was 03:00.
#
#
# Whitman says Dublin Mean Time was -0:25:21, which is more precise than Shanks.

# From an anonymous contributor (1996-06-02):
# The law governing time in Ireland is under Statutory Instrument SI 395/94,
# which gives force to European Union 7th Council Directive # 94/21/EC.
# Under this directive, the Minister for Justice in Ireland makes appropriate
# regulations. I spoke this morning with the Secretary of the Department of
# Justice (tel +353 1 678 9711) who confirmed to me that the correct name is
# "Irish Summer Time", abbreviated to "IST".

# Previous editions of this database used abbreviations like MET DST

#
# as defined in the German Time Act (Gesetz ueber die Zeitbestimmung (ZeitG),

# [IATA SSIM (1992/1996) claims that the Baltic republics switch at 01:00s,
# but a relative confirms that Estonia still switches at 02:00s, writing:]
# ``I do not [know] exactly but there are some little different
# (confusing) rules for International Air and Railway Transport Schedules
# conversion in Sunday connected with end of summer time in Estonia....
# A discussion is running about the summer time efficiency and effect on
# human physiology.  It seems that Estonia maybe will not change to
# summer time next spring.''

# The 1998-09-22 Estonian time law
# </a>
# refers to the Eighth Directive and cites the association agreement between
# the EU and Estonia, ratified by the Estonian law (RT II 1995, 22--27, 120).
#
# I also asked [my relative] whether they use any standard abbreviation
# for their standard and summer times. He says no, they use "suveaeg"
# (summer time) and "talveaeg" (winter time).

# Iceland
#
# From Adam David <adam@veda.is> (1993-11-06):
# The name of the timezone in Iceland for system / mail / news purposes is GMT.
#
# (1993-12-05):
# This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of
# Iceland Almanak.
#
# From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour
# behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts
# of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavik mean solar time which
# was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.
#
# "first day of winter" referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks
# of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the
# time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always
# Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.
#
# (1993-12-10):
# I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the
# beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus
# to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.
#	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke's day
#	(old style), or on St. Luke's day, if a Saturday.
# St. Luke's day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. "old style"
# might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it
# might mean something else (???).
#
# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1993-12-09):
# The Iceland Almanak, Shanks and Whitman disagree on many points.
# We go with the Almanak, except for one claim from Shanks, namely that
# Reykavik was -1:28 from 1837 to 1908, local mean time before that.

# Latvia

# From Liene Kanepe <Liene_Kanepe@lm.gov.lv> (1998-09-17):

# I asked about this matter Scientific Secretary of the Institute of Astronomy
# of The University of Latvia Dr. paed Mr. Ilgonis Vilks. I also searched the
# correct data in juridical acts and I found some juridical documents about
# changes in the counting of time in Latvia from 1981....
#
# Act No.35 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1981-01-22 ...
# according to the Act No.925 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1980-10-24
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on 1 April at 00:00 (GMT 31 March 21:00)
# and 1 hour backward on the 1 October at 00:00 (GMT 30 September 20:00).
#
# Act No.592 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1984-09-24 ...
# according to the Act No.967 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1984-09-13
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 23:00 on the previous day) and 1 hour backward on the last Sunday of
# September at 03:00 (GMT 23:00 on the previous day).
#
# Act No.81 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1989-03-22 ...
# according to the Act No.227 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1989-03-14
# ...: since the last Sunday of March 1989 in Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR,
# Estonian SSR and Kaliningrad region of Russian Federation all year round the
# time of 2nd time zone (Moscow time minus one hour). On the territory of Latvia
# transition to summer time is performed on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour forward.  The end of
# daylight saving time is performed on the last Sunday of September at 03:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour backward. Exception is
# 1989-03-26, when we must not turn the hands of the clock....
#
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia of
# 1997-01-21 on transition to Summer time ... established the same order of
# daylight savings time settings as in the States of the European Union.

# From Chris Carrier <72157.3334@CompuServe.COM> (1996-12-02):
# On 1929-10-01 the Soviet Union instituted an ``Eternal Calendar''
# with 30-day months plus 5 holidays, with a 5-day week.
# On 1931-12-01 it changed to a 6-day week; in 1934 it reverted to the
# Gregorian calendar while retaining the 6-day week; on 1940-06-27 it
# reverted to the 7-day week.  With the 6-day week the usual days
# off were the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 30th of the month.
# (Source: Evitiar Zerubavel, _The Seven Day Circle_)
#
# From Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> (1996-11-22):
# Except for Moscow after 1919-07-01, I invented the time zone abbreviations,
# and (unless otherwise specified) guessed what happened after 1991.
# Moscow time zone abbreviations after 1919-07-01, and Moscow rules after 1991,
# are from Andrey A. Chernov.  The rest is from Shanks and the IATA.
#
# From Andrey A. Chernov <ache@nagual.ru> (1996-10-04):
# `MSK' and `MSD' were born and used initially on Moscow computers with
# Unix-like OSes by several developer groups (e.g. Demos group, Kiae group)....
# The next step was the UUCP network, the Relcom predecessor
# (used mainly for mail), and MSK/MSD was actively used there.
#
# From Chris Carrier <72157.3334@CompuServe.COM> (1996-10-30):
# According to a friend of mine who rode the Trans-Siberian Railroad from
# Moscow to Irkutsk in 1995, public air and rail transport in Russia ...
# still follows Moscow time, no matter where in Russia it is located.

# Subject: Re: Gregorian reform -- a part of locale?
# </a>
# Date: 1996-07-06
#
# In 1700, Denmark made the transition from Julian to Gregorian.  Sweden
# decided to *start* a transition in 1700 as well, but rather than have one of
# those unsightly calendar gaps :-), they simply decreed that the next leap
# year after 1696 would be in 1744 -- putting the whole country on a calendar
# different from both Julian and Gregorian for a period of 40 years.
#
# However, in 1704 something went wrong and the plan was not carried through;
# they did, after all, have a leap year that year.  And one in 1708.  In 1712
# they gave it up and went back to Julian, putting 30 days in February that
# year!...
#
# Then in 1753, Sweden made the transition to Gregorian in the usual manner,
# getting there only 13 years behind the original schedule.
#
# (A previous posting of this story was challenged, and Swedish readers
# produced the following references to support it: "Tiderakning och historia"
# by Natanael Beckman (1924) and "Tid, en bok om tiderakning och
# kalendervasen" by Lars-Olof Lode'n (no date was given).)

# One source shows that Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, and Greece observe DST from
# the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in September in 1986.
# The source shows Romania changing a day later than everybody else.
#
# According to Bernard Sieloff's source, Poland is in the MET time zone but
# uses the WE DST rules.  The Western USSR uses EET+1 and ME DST rules.
# Bernard Sieloff's source claims Romania switches on the same day, but at
# 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST).  It also claims that Turkey
# switches on the same day, but switches on at 01:00 standard time
# and off at 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST)

#
# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European coun[tr]ies started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep
# lastSun' in 1981---I don't know how they handle now.
#
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

# ...
#
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
#
# ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
# first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
# dates...
#
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.

# Greece: Last Sunday in April to last Sunday in September (iffy on dates).
# Since 1978.  Change at midnight.

# Monaco: has same DST as France.
