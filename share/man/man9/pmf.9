.Sh DESCRIPTION
The machine-independent
.Nm
framework provides power management and inter-driver messaging support
for device drivers.
.Sh DATA TYPES
Drivers for devices implementing
.Nm
may make use of the following data type:
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fa pmf_generic_event_t
A device driver can register as a listener for specific events, or inject
events into the message queue.
The following message types are defined:
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It
.Dv PMFE_DISPLAY_ON
.It
.Dv PMFE_DISPLAY_REDUCED
.It
.Dv PMFE_DISPLAY_STANDBY
.It
.Dv PMFE_DISPLAY_SUSPEND
.It
.Dv PMFE_DISPLAY_OFF
.It
.Dv PMFE_DISPLAY_BRIGHTNESS_UP
.It
.Dv PMFE_DISPLAY_BRIGHTNESS_DOWN
.It
.Dv PMFE_AUDIO_VOLUME_DOWN
.It
.Dv PMFE_AUDIO_VOLUME_TOGGLE
.It
.Dv PMFE_CHASSIS_LID_CLOSE
.It
.Dv PMFE_CHASSIS_LID_OPEN

.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn pmf_device_register "dev" "suspend" "resume"
Register a device with the power management framework. If either
.Fa suspend
or
.Fa resume
is
.Dv NULL
then it is assumed that device state does not need to be captured and
resumed on a power transition. Bus and class-level power management
will still be performed. Returns
.Dv false
if there was an error.
.It Fn pmf_device_register1 "dev" "suspend" "resume" "shutdown"
Like pmf_device_register, but additionally registers a shutdown handler.
.It Fn pmf_device_deregister "dev"
Deregister a device with the power management framework.
.It Fn pmf_device_suspend "dev"
Suspend a device by first calling the class suspend handler, followed by
the driver suspend handler, and finally the bus suspend handler.
.It Fn pmf_device_resume "dev"
Resume a device by first calling the bus resume handler, followed by the
driver resume handler, and finally the class resume handler.
.It Fn pmf_device_recursive_suspend "dev"
As
.Fn pmf_device_suspend ,
but ensures that all child devices of
.Fa dev
are suspended.
.It Fn pmf_device_recursive_resume "dev"
As
.Fn pmf_device_resume ,
but ensures that all parent devices of
.Fa dev
are resumed.
.It Fn pmf_device_resume_subtree "dev"
As
.Fn pmf_device_resume ,
but ensures that all child devices of
.Fa dev
are resumed.
.It Fn pmf_class_network_register "dev" "ifp"
Register a device with the power management framework as a network-class
device.
.It Fn pmf_class_input_register "dev"
Register a device with the power management framework as an input-class
device.
.It Fn pmf_class_display_register "dev"
Register a device with the power management framework as a display-class
device.
.It Fn pmf_system_suspend "void"
Suspend all attached devices. Devices are suspended by traversing the
autoconfiguration tree beginning with the leaf nodes.
This function will fail if any attached drivers do not support the power
management framework.
.It Fn pmf_system_resume "void"
Resume all attached devices. Devices are resumed by traversing the
autoconfiguration tree beginning with devices that do not have a parent.
This function will fail if any attached drivers do not support the power
management framework.
.It Fn pmf_system_shutdown "int"
Shutdown all attached devices. Devices are shut down by traversing the
autoconfiguration tree beginning with the leaf nodes.
The integer argument is passed to the driver shutdown functions.
It should contain the reboot(2)
.Dq howto
argument.
This function ignores the presence of attached drivers that do not support the
power management framework.
.It Fn pmf_event_register "dev" "ev" "handler" "global"
Register the callback
.Fa handler
to be called whenever an
.Fa ev
event is triggered. If
.Fa global
is
.Dv true ,
.Fa handler
accepts anonymous events from
.Fn pmf_event_inject .
.It Fn pmf_event_deregister "dev" "ev" "handler" "global"
Deregister the callback previously registered with
.Fn pmf_event_register .
.It Fn pmf_event_inject "dev" "ev"
Inject an inter-driver message into the message queue. If
.Fa dev
is
.Dv NULL ,
the event is considered to be anonymous and one or more drivers
may handle this event, otherwise the event is delivered directly to
the callback registered by
.Fa dev .
.It Fn pmf_set_platform "key" "value"
Insert a name-value pair into the platform information database.
.It Fn pmf_get_platform "key"
Retrieve the value for
.Fa key
from the platform information database. Returns
.Dv NULL
if the key is not present.
