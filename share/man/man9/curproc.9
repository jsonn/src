.Sh NAME
.Nm curproc ,
.Nm curcpu ,
.Nm curlwp
.Nd current process, processor, and
.Tn LWP
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/proc.h
.Ft struct cpu_info *
.Fn curcpu "void"
.Ft struct proc *
.Fn curproc "void"
.Ft struct lwp *
.Fn curlwp "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The following macros can be used to retrieve
the current processor, process, and light-weight process
.Pq Tn LWP ,
respectively:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
The machine-dependent
.Fn curcpu
macro returns a pointer to a
.Em cpu_info
structure containing information of the
.Tn CPU
that this thread is running on.
.It
The machine-independent
.Fn curproc
macro refers to a pointer to the process currently running on this
.Tn CPU .
.It
The
.Fn curlwp
macro expands to a pointer to
.Em lwp
structure, containing information about the current
.Tn LWP .
This macro is machine-independent,
but machine-dependent
.In machine/cpu.h
