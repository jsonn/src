.Sh NAME
.Nm tcp_congctl
.Nd TCP congestion control API
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netinet/tcp_congctl.h
.\"
.Ft int
.Fn tcp_congctl_register "const char *" "struct tcp_congctl *"
.\"
.Ft int
.Fn tcp_congctl_unregister "const char *"
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tcp_congctrl
API is used to add or remove TCP congestion control algorithms
on-the-fly and to modularize them.
It includes basically two functions:
.Bl -tag -width "xxxxx"
.It Fn tcp_congctl_register "const char *" "struct tcp_congctl *"
Registers a new congestion control algorithm.
The
.Fa struct tcp_congctl
argument must contain a list of callbacks like the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct tcp_congctl {
	int  (*fast_retransmit)(struct tcpcb *,
	    struct tcphdr *);
	void (*slow_retransmit)(struct tcpcb *);
	void (*fast_retransmit_newack)(struct tcpcb *,
	    struct tcphdr *);
	void (*newack)(struct tcpcb *,
	    struct tcphdr *);
	void (*cong_exp)(struct tcpcb *);
};
.Ed
.It Fn tcp_congctl_unregister "const char *"
If found, unregister the selected TCP congestion control algorithm.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn tcp_congctl_register
and
.Fn tcp_congctl_unregister
both return
.Dv 0
when there is no error.
If the name is already registered,
.Fn tcp_congctl_register
will return
.Er EEXIST .
.Fn tcp_congctl_unregister
can return
.Er ENOENT
if there is no congestion control algorithm by that name and can return
.Er EBUSY
if the matched algorithm is being used by userspace applications.
.Sh FILES
Implementation is in
.Pa sys/netinet/tcp_congctl.c
and the interface is in
.Pa sys/netinet/tcp_congctl.h .
