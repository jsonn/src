.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu_coredump
.Nd machine-dependent process core dump interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/signalvar.h
.Ft int
.Fn cpu_coredump "struct lwp *l" "void *iocookie" "struct core *chdr"
.Ft int
.Fn cpu_coredump32 "struct lwp *l" "void *iocookie" "struct core32 *chdr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cpu_coredump
is the machine-dependent interface invoked by machine-independent code
to dump the machine-dependent header information at the start of a
process core dump.
The header information primarily consists of the
CPU and floating-point registers.
.Fa l
is the lwp structure of the thread being dumped.
.Fa iocookie
is an opaque pointer to be passed to
.Fn coredump_write .
Information about the machine-dependent header sections are returned in
.Fa chdr .
.Pp
.Fn cpu_coredump
returns 0 on success and an appropriate error code on failure.
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
This section describes places within the
.Nx
source tree where actual code implementing or using the
machine-dependent coredump interface can be found.
All pathnames are relative to
.Pa /usr/src .
.Pp
Process core dumps are initiated within the file
.Pa sys/kern/kern_sig.c .
Process core dumps for ELF
.Nx
binaries are performed within the files
.Pa sys/kern/core_elf32.c
or
.Pa sys/kern/core_elf64.c .
Process core dumps for other
.Nx
binaries are performed within the file
.Pa sys/kern/core_netbsd.c .
