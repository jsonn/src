.Sh NAME
.Nm bintime_add
.Nd operations on
.Dq bintime
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/time.h
.Ft vid
.Fn bintime_add "struct bintime *bt" "const struct bintime *bt2"
.Ft void
.Fn bintime_addx "struct bintime *bt" "uint64_t x"
.Ft void
.Fn bintime_sub "struct bintime *bt" "const struct bintime *bt2"
.Ft void
.Fn bintime2timespec "const struct bintime *bt" "struct timespec *ts"
.Ft void
.Fn timespec2bintime "const struct timespec *ts" "struct bintime *bt"
.Ft void
.Fn bintime2timeval "const struct bintime *bt" "struct timeval *tv"
.Ft void
.Fn timeval2bintime "const struct timeval *tv" "struct bintime *bt"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are provided for convenience as part of the machine-independent
.Xr timecounter 9
framework.
All of them operate with the
.Em bintime
structure.
.Pp
The function
.Fn bintime_add
adds the time information stored in
.Fa bt2
to
.Fa bt .
Conversely,
.Fn bintime_sub
subtracts
.Fa bt2
from
.Fa bt .
The
.Fn bintime_addx
function stores the fraction of a second
.Fa x
to
.Fa bt .
.Pp
Like the function names bespeak,
.Fn bintime2timespec
converts the
.Em bintime
structure to
.Em struct timespec
and
.Fn timespec2bintime
does the opposite.
The functions
.Fn bintime2timeval
and
.Fn timeval2bintime
operate with
.Em struct timeval
instead.
The result is stored to the right-hand side.
