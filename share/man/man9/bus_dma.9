.Sh DESCRIPTION
Provide a bus- and machine-independent "DMA mapping interface."
.Sh NOTES
.Pp
All data structures, function prototypes, and macros will be defined
by the port-specific header
.Pa Aq machine/bus.h .
Note that this document
assumes the existence of types already defined by the current "bus.h"
interface.
.Pp
Unless otherwise noted, all function calls in this interface may be
defined as
.Xr cpp 1
macros.
.Sh DATA TYPES
.Pp
Individual implementations may name these structures whatever they
wish, providing that the external representations are:
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fa bus_dma_tag_t
A machine-dependent opaque type describing the implementation of
DMA for a given bus.
.It Fa bus_dma_segment_t
A structure with at least the following members:
.Bd -literal
	bus_addr_t	ds_addr;
	bus_size_t	ds_len;
.Ed
.sp
The structure may have machine-dependent members and arbitrary layout.
The values in

The structure may have machine-dependent members and arbitrary layout.
The
.Fa dm_segs
member may be an array of segments or a pointer to an
array of segments.  The
.Fa dm_nsegs
member indicates the number of segments in
.Fa dm_segs .
A value of 0 indicates the mapping is invalid.
.It Fa bus_dmasync_op_t

.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn bus_dmamap_create "tag" "size" "nsegments" "maxsegsz" "boundary" "flags" "dmamp"
Allocates a DMA handle and initializes it according to the parameters
provided. Arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width nsegments -compact
.It Fa tag
This is the bus_dma_tag_t passed down from the parent driver via
.Fa <bus>_attach_args .
.It Fa size
This is the maximum DMA transfer that can be mapped by the handle.
.It Fa nsegments
Number of segments the device can support in a single DMA transaction.
This may be the number of scatter-gather descriptors supported by the
device.
.It Fa maxsegsz
The maximum number of bytes that may be transferred by any given DMA
segment.
.It Fa boundary
Some DMA controllers are not able to transfer data that crosses a
particular boundary.  This argument allows this boundary to be
specified.  The boundary lines begin at 0, and occur every
.Fa boundary
bytes.  Mappings may begin on a boundary line but may not end on or
cross a boundary line.  If no boundary condition needs to be observed, a
.Fa boundary
argument of 0 should be used.
.It Fa flags
Flags are defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width BUS_DMA_ALLOCNOW -compact
.It Dv BUS_DMA_WAITOK
It is safe to wait (sleep) for resources during this call.
.It Dv BUS_DMA_NOWAIT
It is not safe to wait (sleep) for resources during this call.
.It Dv BUS_DMA_ALLOCNOW
Perform any resource allocation this handle may need now.  If this is
not specified, the allocation may be deferred to
.Fn bus_dmamap_load .
If this flag is specified,
.Fn bus_dmamap_load
will not block on resource
allocation.
.It Dv BUS_DMA_BUS[1-4]
These flags are placeholders, and may be used by busses to provide
bus-dependent functionality.
.El
.It Fa dmamp
This is a pointer to a bus_dmamap_t.  A DMA map will be allocated and
pointed to by 
.Fa dmamp
upon successful completion of this routine.
.El
.Pp
Behavior is not defined if invalid arguments are passed to
.Fn bus_dmamap_create .
.Pp
Returns 0 on success, or an error code to indicate mode of failure.
.It Fn bus_dmamap_destroy "tag" "dmam"
Frees all resources associated with a given DMA handle.  Arguments are
as follows:
.Bl -tag -width dmam -compact
.It Fa tag
This is the bus_dma_tag_t passed down from the parent driver via
.Fa <bus>_attach_args .
.It Fa dmam
The DMA handle to destroy.
.El
.Pp
In the event that the DMA handle contains a valid mapping,
the mapping will be unloaded via the same mechanism used by 
.Fn bus_dmamap_unload .
.Pp
Behavior is not defined if invalid arguments are passed to
.Fn bus_dmamap_destroy .
.Pp
If given valid arguments,
.Fn bus_dmamap_destroy
always succeeds.
.It Fn bus_dmamap_load "tag" "dmam" "buf" "buflen" "p" "flags"
Loads a DMA handle with mappings for a DMA transfer.  It assumes that
all pages involved in a DMA transfer are wired. Arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width buflen -compact
.It Fa tag
This is the bus_dma_tag_t passed down from the parent driver via
.Fa <bus>_attach_args .
.It Fa dmam
The DMA handle with which to map the transfer.
.It Fa buf
The buffer to be used for the DMA transfer.
.It Fa buflen
The size of the buffer.
.It Fa p
Used to indicate the address space in which the buffer is located.  If
.Dv NULL ,
the buffer is assumed to be in kernel space.  Otherwise, the
buffer is assumed to be in process
.Fa p Ns 's
address space.
.It Fa flags
are defined as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "BUS_DMA_BUS[1-4]" -compact
.It Dv BUS_DMA_WAITOK
It is safe to wait (sleep) for resources during this call.
.It Dv BUS_DMA_NOWAIT
It is not safe to wait (sleep) for resources during this call.
.It Dv BUS_DMA_BUS[1-4]
These flags are placeholders, and may be used by busses to
provide bus-dependent functionality.
.El
.El
.Pp
As noted above, if a DMA handle is created with
.Dv BUS_DMA_ALLOCNOW ,
.Fn bus_dmamap_load
will never block.
.Pp
If a call to 
.Fn bus_dmamap_load
fails, the mapping in
the DMA handle will be invalid.  It is the responsibility
of the caller to clean up any inconsistent device state
resulting from incomplete iteration through the uio.
.Pp
Behavior is not defined if invalid arguments are passed to
.Fn bus_dmamap_load .
.Pp
Returns 0 on success, or an error code to indicate mode of failure.
.It Fn bus_dmamap_load_mbuf "tag" "dmam" "chain" "flags"
This is a variation of 
.Fn bus_dmamap_load
which maps mbuf chains
for DMA transfers.  Mbuf chains are assumed to be in kernel
virtual address space.
.It Fn bus_dmamap_load_uio "tag" "dmam" "uio" "flags"
This is a variation of
.Fn bus_dmamap_load
which maps buffers pointed to by
.Fa uio
for DMA transfers.  The value of
.Fa "uio->uio_segflg"
will
determine if the buffers are in user or kernel virtual address space.
If the buffers are in user address space, the buffers are assumed to be
in
.Fa "uio->uio_procp" Ns 's
address space.
.It Fn bus_dmamap_load_raw "tag" "dmam" "segs" "nsegs" "size" "flags"
This is a variation of
.Fn bus_dmamap_load
which maps buffers
allocated by
.Fn bus_dmamem_alloc
(see below).  The
.Fa segs
argument is an array of bus_dma_segment_t's filled in
by
.Fn bus_dmamem_alloc .
The
.Fa nsegs
argument is the number of segments in the array.  The
.Fa size
argument is the size of the DMA transfer.
.It Fn bus_dmamap_unload "tag" "dmam"
Deletes the mappings for a given DMA handle.  Arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width dmam -compact
.It Fa tag
This is the bus_dma_tag_t passed down from the parent driver via
.Fa <bus>_attach_args .
.It Fa dmam
The DMA handle containing the mappings which are to be deleted.
.El
.Pp
If the DMA handle was created with
.Dv BUS_DMA_ALLOCNOW ,
.Fn bus_dmamap_unload
will not free the corresponding
resources which were allocated by
.Fn bus_dmamap_create .
This is to ensure that
.Fn bus_dmamap_load
will never block
on resources if the handle was created with
.Dv BUS_DMA_ALLOCNOW .
.Pp
Behavior is not defined if invalid arguments are passed to
.Fn bus_dmamap_unload .
.Pp
If given valid arguments,
.Fn bus_dmamap_unload
always succeeds.
.It Fn bus_dmamap_sync "tag" "dmam" "op"
Performs pre- and post-DMA operation cache and/or buffer synchronization.
Arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width dmam -compact
.It Fa tag
This is the bus_dma_tag_t passed down from the parent driver via
.Fa <bus>_attach_args .
.It Fa dmam
The DMA mapping to be synchronized.
.It Fa op
The synchronization operation to perform.  The following DMA synchronization
operations are defined:
.Bl -tag -width BUS_DMASYNC_POSTWRITE -compact
.It Dv BUS_DMASYNC_PREREAD
Perform any pre-read DMA cache and/or bounce operations.
.It Dv BUS_DMASYNC_POSTREAD
Perform any post-read DMA cache and/or bounce operations.
.It Dv BUS_DMASYNC_PREWRITE
Perform any pre-write DMA cache and/or bounce operations.
.It Dv BUS_DMASYNC_POSTWRITE
Perform any post-write DMA cache and/or bounce operations.
.El
.El
.Pp
This function exists so that multiple read and write transfers can be
performed with the same buffer, and so that drivers can explicitly
inform the
.Nm 
code when their data is 'ready' in its DMA buffer.
.Pp
An example of multiple read-write use of a single mapping
might look like:
.Bd -literal
bus_dmamap_load(...);

while (not done) {
	/* invalidate soon-to-be-stale cache blocks */
	bus_dmamap_sync(..., BUS_DMASYNC_PREREAD);

	[ do read DMA ]

	/* copy from bounce */
	bus_dmamap_sync(..., BUS_DMASYNC_POSTREAD);

	/* read data now in driver-provided buffer */

	[ computation ]

	/* data to be written now in driver-provided buffer */

	/* flush write buffers and writeback, copy to bounce */
	bus_dmamap_sync(..., BUS_DMASYNC_PREWRITE);

	[ do write DMA ]

	/* probably a no-op, but provided for consistency */
	bus_dmamap_sync(..., BUS_DMASYNC_POSTWRITE);
}

bus_dmamap_unload(...);
.Ed
.Pp
If DMA read and write operations are not preceded and followed by the
appropriate synchronization operations, behavior is undefined.
.Pp
Behavior is not defined if invalid arguments are passed to
.Fn bus_dmamap_sync .
.Pp
If given valid arguments,
.Fn bus_dmamap_sync
always succeeds.
.\" XXX: This does not work with all the arguments.
.It Fn bus_dmamem_alloc "tag" "size" "alignment" "boundary" "segs" "..."
Allocates memory that is "DMA safe" for the bus corresponding to the
given tag.  The mapping of this memory is machine-dependent (or
"opaque"); machine-independent code is not to assume that the
addresses returned are valid in kernel virtual address space, or that
the addresses returned are system physical addresses.
.Pp
Allocations will always be rounded to the hardware page size.  Callers
may wish to take advantage of this, and cluster allocation of small
data structures. Arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width alignment -compact
.It Fa tag
The is the bus_dma_tag_t passed down from the parent driver via
.Fa <bus>_attach_args .
.It Fa size
The amount of memory to allocate.
.It Fa alignment

the alignment is less than a hardware page size, it will be rounded up
to the hardware page size.  This value must be a power of two.
.It Fa boundary
Each segment in the allocated memory must not cross this boundary
(relative to zero).  This value must be a power of two.  A boundary
value less than the size of the allocation is invalid.
.It Fa segs
An array of bus_dma_segment_t's, filled in as memory is allocated,
representing the opaque addresses of the memory chunks.
.It Fa nsegs
Specifies the number of segments in
.Fa segs ,
and this is the maximum number
of segments that the allocated memory may contain.

This is the bus_dma_tag_t passed down from the parent driver via
.Fa <bus>_attach_args .
.It Fa segs
The array of bus_dma_segment_t's filled in by

It is safe to wait (sleep) for resources during this call.
.It Dv BUS_DMA_NOWAIT
It is not safe to wait (sleep) for resources during this call.

bus-dependent functionality.
.It Dv BUS_DMAMEM_NOSYNC
Map the memory in such a way that synchronization of the map with
