.Sh NAME
.Nm sched_4bsd
.Nd The 4.4BSD thread scheduler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/sched.h
.Ft void
.Fn resetpriority "lwp_t *l"
.Ft void
.Fn sched_tick "struct cpu_info *ci"
.Ft void
.Fn sched_schedclock "lwp_t *l"
.Ft void
.Fn sched_pstats_hook "struct proc *p" "int minslp"
.Ft void
.Fn sched_setrunnable "lwp_t *l"
.Ft void
.Fn updatepri "lwp_t *l"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nx
thread scheduling sub-system employs a
.Dq multilevel feedback queues
algorithm, favouring interactive, short-running threads to
CPU-bound ones.
.Pp
.Fn resetpriority
recomputes the priority of a thread running in user mode.
If the resulting priority is higher than that of the
current thread, a reschedule is arranged.
.Pp
.Fn sched_tick
gets called from
.Xr hardclock 9
every 100ms to force a switch between equal priority threads.
.Pp
The priority of the current thread is adjusted through
.Fn sched_schedclock .
The priority of a thread gets worse as it accumulates CPU time.
.Pp
.Fn sched_pstats_hook
gets called from
.Fn sched_pstats
every Hz ticks in order to recompute the priorities of all threads.
.Pp
.Fn sched_setrunnable
checks if an LWP has slept for more than one second.
If so, its priority is updated by
.Fn updatepri .
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
This section describes places within the
.Nx
source tree where actual code implementing the scheduler can be found.
All pathnames are relative to
.Pa /usr/src .
.Pp
The 4.4BSD scheduler subsystem is implemented within the file
.Pa sys/kern/sched_4bsd.c .
