.Nd machine-dependent kernel core dumps
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/systm.h
.Ft void
.Fn cpu_dumpconf "void"
.Ft int
.Fn cpu_dump "int (*dump)(dev_t, daddr_t, void *, size_t)" "daddr_t *blknop"
.Ft int
.Fn cpu_dumpsize "void"
.Ft void
.Fn dumpsys "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cpu_dumpconf
is the machine-dependent interface invoked during system bootstrap to
determine the dump device and initialize machine-dependent kernel core
dump state.
Internally,
.Fn cpu_dumpconf
will invoke
.Fn cpu_dumpsize
to calculate the size of machine-dependent kernel core dump headers.
.Pp
.Fn dumpsys
is invoked by
.Fn cpu_reboot
to dump kernel physical memory onto the dump device.
.Fn dumpsys
invokes
.Fn cpu_dump
to write the machine-dependent header to the dump device at block number
.Fa *blknop
using the dump device's PIO dump routine specified by the
.Fa dump
argument.
.Pp
.Fn cpu_dumpsize ,
.Fn cpu_dump ,
and
.Fn dumpsys
are parts of the machine-dependent interface, however they are not
exported to machine-independent code.
