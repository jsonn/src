.Dt HZ 9

.Sh NAME
.Nm hz
.Nd system clock frequency
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/kernel.h
.Va int hz;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
specifies the number of times the
.Xr hardclock 9
timer ticks per second.
.Nm
is hardware-dependent; it can be overridden (if the machine dependent
code supports this) by defining
.Em HZ
in the kernel configuration file (see
.Xr options 4 ) .
Only override the default value if you really know what you are
doing.
