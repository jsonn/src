.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn imin ,
.Fn lmin ,
.Fn min ,
and
.Fn ulmin
functions return whichever argument is algebraically smaller, differing only
in their argument and return types: these functions operate on, respectively,
natural size, long, unsigned and unsigned long integers.
.Pp
The
.Fn imax ,
.Fn lmax ,
.Fn max ,
and
.Fn ulmax
functions are identical except that they return the algebraically larger
argument between
.Ar a
and
.Ar b .
