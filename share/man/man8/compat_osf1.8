.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_osf1
.Nd setup procedure for running OSF/1 binaries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
supports running OSF/1 (a.k.a Digital Unix, a.k.a. Tru64) binaries on
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha
systems.
Most programs should work, including the ones that use the shared object
libraries.
Programs that make direct MACH system calls will not work.
The OSF/1 compatibility feature is active for kernels compiled with the
.Dv COMPAT_OSF1
option enabled (see
.Xr options 4 ) .
.Pp
To run dynamically linked programs, you will need the OSF/1 shared libraries,
runtime linker, and certain configuration files found in /etc.
These are installed in a
.Dq shadow root
directory called
.Pa /emul/osf1 .
Any file operations done by OSF/1 programs run under
.Nx
will look in this directory first, and fall back to the file system proper.
So, if an OSF/1 program opens
.Pa /etc/svc.conf ,
.Nx
will first try to open
.Pa /emul/osf1/etc/svc.conf ,
and if that file does not exist it will then try
.Pa /etc/svc.conf .
Shared libraries and configuration specific to OSF/1 should be installed
in the shadow tree.
.Ss Setting up /emul/osf1
The simple technique is to install pkgsrc/emulators/osf1_lib.
(You may
also want to install pkgsrc/www/navigator and/or pkgsrc/www/communicator.)
.Pp
Alternatively, if you have access to an OSF/1 machine and if the licensing
details permit, you can copy the contents of:
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It
.Pa /shlib
.It
.Pa /usr/shlib
.It
.Pa /etc/sia
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/locale
.El
.Pp
(The latter is required to run Netscape Navigator or Communicator.)
.Pp
Also copy
.Bl -item -compact -offset indent
.It
.Pa /etc/svc.conf
.It
.Pa /usr/ccs/lib/cmplrs/otabase/libots.so
.It
.Pa /sbin/loader
.El
.Pp
Or, simply NFS mount the appropriate directories under
.Pa /emul/osf1 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr config 1 ,
.Xr options 4
.Sh BUGS
Your
.Xr hostname 1
.Em must
contain a dot
.Em or
your
.Xr resolv.conf 5
must contain a
.Li search
line.
Without one of those, the OSF/1 resolver will die and no hostname
resolution will be possible.
.Pp
Certain values in
.Pa /emul/osf1/etc/svc.conf
can cause programs to fail with
.Dq Bad system call .
.Pp
Pathnames pointed to by symbolic links are not looked up in the
shadow root when running an OSF/1 executable.
This is not consistent.
