.Nd create system and device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Ar device_name Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The shell script
.Nm MAKEDEV ,
found in the
.Pa /dev
directory, is used to create the common special
files.
.\"See
.\".Xr special (8)
.\"for a more complete discussion of special files.
.Pp
.Nm MAKEDEV
takes any number of device names as arguments, where the names are
the common abbreviation for the device.
There are two special devices,
.Ar std
and
.Ar local .
The former creates the standard devices for the architecture.
The latter is for devices specific to the local site, and
executes the shell file 
.Pa MAKEDEV.local .
.Pp
The
.Tn x68k
supports the following devices.
Where a device name is followed by a hash sign
.Ql \&# ,
the hash sign
must be replaced by a unit number.
