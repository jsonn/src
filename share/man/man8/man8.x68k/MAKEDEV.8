.Sh NAME
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Nd create system and device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar special Op Ar ...
.Pp
.Nm
.Ar device Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create system and device special files.
As arguments it takes the names of known devices, like
.Ar sd0 ,
or of special targets, like
.Pa all
or
.Pa std ,
which create a collection of device special files.
.Pp
The script is in
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
and must be called from the
.Pa /dev
directory.
For the creation of the devices,
.Xr mknod 8
is used, which can only be used for creating devices by the
super-user.
.Pp
The special targets supported on
.Nx Ns / Ns x68k
are:
.Pp
.\" @@@SPECIAL@@@
.Bl -tag -width 01234567 -compact
.It Ar all
Makes all known devices, including local devices, Tries to make the ``standard'' number of each.
.It Ar floppy
Devices to be put on install floppies
.It Ar fd
Makes fd/* for the fdescfs.
.It Ar std
Standard devices
.It Ar local
Configuration specific devices
.It Ar isdns
Make ISDN devices
