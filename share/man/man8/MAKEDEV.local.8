.Sh NAME
.Nm MAKEDEV.local
.Nd create site-specific device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fMs
.Op Fl m Ar mknod
.Op Fl p Ar pax
.Bro Pa all | site-specific-argument Brc Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create site-specific device special files.
Each argument may be the word
.Pa all
or a site-specific argument.
By default, there are no valid site-specific arguments,
and the
.Pa all
argument has no effect;
This may be changed by editing the script.
.Pp
The script is in
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV.local
and must be called from the
.Pa /dev
directory.
.Pp
Supported options for
.Nm
are the same as for
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/MAKEDEV.local" -compact
.It Pa /dev
special device files directory
.It Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
script that invokes
.Nm
with the
.Pa all
argument.
.It Pa /dev/MAKEDEV.local
script described in this man page

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
Handling of the same command line options as
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 ,
and the use of
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
as a function library, was added in
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh NOTES
The relationship between
.Nm
and
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
is complex:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
is invoked with the
.Pa all
or
.Pa local
argument, then it will invoke
.Nm
as a child process, with options similar to
those that were originally passed to
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 ,
and with the
.Pa all
argument.
.It
.Nm
uses shell functions defined in
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 .
This is done by loading
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
using the shell
.Dq \&.
command, with the
.Ev MAKEDEV_AS_LIBRARY
variable set (to inform
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
that it should behave as a function library,
not as an independent program).
