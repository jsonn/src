.Dt COMPAT_ULTRIX 8
.Os NetBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_ultrix
.Nd setup procedure for Ultrix compatibility on mips and vax architectures
.Sh DESCRIPTION

NetBSD/mips and NetBSD/vax architectures can run Risc ULTRIX and Vax
ULTRIX executables, respectively.  However, you have to worry about
the legal issues of ensuring that you have a right to use any ULTRIX
binaries on your machine.
.Pp
Most executables will work.  The exceptions include programs that use
proprietary, Ultrix-specific features (LAT, CI support, DECnet
support) and various system calls, ioctl()'s, or Ultrix kernel
semantics that are difficult to emulate (e.g., Ultrix packetfilter) or
buggy (e.g., Ultrix YP). 
.Pp
All Ultrix executables are static, so no shared libraries are required
for Ultrix compatiblity. However, Ultrix is based on a 4.3BSD alpha
release.  Ultrix commands and libraries are often much older than
their NetBSD or even SunOS 4.x equivalents, and may require incompatible
configuration files.
.Sh SYSTEM CONFIGURATION FILES
Set up resolv.conf and svc.conf as below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact -offset indent
.It # mkdir -p /emul/ultrix/etc
.br
.It # cd /emul/ultrix/etc
.br
.It # egrep 'domain|nameserver' /etc/resolv.conf  > ./resolv.conf
.br
.It # cp -p /usr/share/examples/emul/ultrix/etc/*	./
.El
.Pp
.Ss /etc/resolv.conf
The Ultrix resolver library only understands
.Sy domain
and
.Sy nameserver
lines in
.Xr  /etc/resolv.conf 5 .
You should create a copy of /etc/resolv.conf containing only those
commands and put it in /emul/ultrix/etc/resolv.conf.  Note that the
domain search order used by Ultrix executables may not be the same as
native binaries; there is no good way around this.
.Pp
.Ss /etc/svc.conf
Ultrix uses /etc/svc.conf to select an ordered search of YP, Hesiod,
or local flat-file mappings.  You should create an
/emul/ultrix/etc/svc.conf specifying either local files or bind (DNS)
lookups for all Ultrix name services.
.Sh BUGS
.Pp
RISC Ultrix YP(NIS) is know to not work.  The Ultrix YP libraries have
a consistent endian-ness bug. Ultrix YP client will not inter-operate
with the NetBSD 
.Xr ypbind 8
process.  The only workaround is to use
/etc/svc.conf to disable YP(NIS).
.Pp
The ndbm hashed-password file used by Ultrix are incompatible with the
db hashed-password file used by NetBSD. There is no good solution for
this. (YP would be a good one, if Ultrix YP worked.)
.Pp 
The API used by Xservers to talk to the kernel is currently compatible
with Ultrix 4.1.  An implementation of the Ultrix 4.2 Xws interface
(used by X11R6) is in progress.
.Pp
A complete list of things which fail to work in Ultrix compatibility
mode should be added here.
