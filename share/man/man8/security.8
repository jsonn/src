.Nx security features
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
supports a variety of security features.
Below is a brief description of them with some quick usage examples
that will help you get started.

.El
.Sh VERIEXEC
.Em Veriexec
is an in-kernel, real-time, file-system idenependent, file integrity
subsystem.
It can be used for a variety of purposes, including defense against trojanned
binaries, indirect attacks via third-party remote file-systems, and
config file corruption.
It can operate in four modes, also referred to as strict levels:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Learning mode ( strict level 0 )
The only level at which the fingerprint tables can be modified, this level is
used to help fine-tune the signature database.
No enforcement is made, and verbose information is provided (fingerprint
matches and mismatches, file removals, incorrect access, etc.).
.It IDS mode ( strict level 1 )
IDS (intrusion detection system) mode provides an adequate level of integrity
for the files it monitors.
Implications:
.Pp
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
Monitored files cannot be removed
.It
If raw disk access is granted to a disk with monitored files on it, all
monitored files' fingerprints will be invalidated
.It
Access to files with mismatched fingerprints is denied
.It
Write access to monitored files is allowed
.It
Access type is not enforced
.El
.It IPS mode ( strict level 2 )
IPS (intrusion prevention system) mode provides a high level of integrity
for the files it monitors.
Implications:
.Pp
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
All implications of IDS mode
.It
Write access to monitored files is denied
.It
Access type is enforced
.It
Raw disk access to disk devices with monitored files on them is denied
.It
Execution of non-monitored files is denied
.It
Write access to kernel memory via
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem
is denied
.El
.It Lockdown mode ( strict level 3 )
Lockdown mode provides high assurance integrity for the entire system.
Implications:
.Pp
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
All implications of IPS mode
.It
Access to non-monitored files is denied
.It
Write access to files is allowed only if the file was opened before the
strict level was raised to this mode
.It
Creation of new files is denied
.It
Raw access to system disks is denied
.El
.El
.Pp
.Em Veriexec
requires a list of monitored files, along with their digital fingerprint and
(optionally) access modes.
.Nx
provides a tool,
.Xr veriexecgen 8 ,
for this purpose.
Example usage:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# veriexecgen
.Ed
.Pp
.Em Veriexec
requires a pseudo-device to run:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pseudo-device veriexec 1
.Ed
.Pp
Additionally, one or more options for digital fingerprint algorithm support:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
options VERIFIED_EXEC_FP_SHA256
options VERIFIED_EXEC_FP_SHA512
.Ed
.Pp
See your kernel's config file for an example.
.Pp
On amd64, i386, prep, and sparc64 GENERIC kernels,
.Em Veriexec
is enabled by default.
.Pp
.Em Veriexec
also requires enabling in
.Xr rc.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
veriexec=YES
veriexec_strict=1 # IDS mode
.Ed
.Sh EXPLOIT MITIGATION
.Nx
incorporates some exploit mitigation features, mainly from the
.Em PaX
project.
.Ss PaX MPROTECT
.Em PaX MPROTECT
are memory protection restrictions, meant to compliment non-executable
mappings.
Their purpose is to prevent situations where malicious code attempts to mark
writable memory regions as executable, often by trashing arguments to an
.Xr mprotect 2
call.
.Pp
While it can be enabled globally,
.Nx
provides a tool,
.Xr paxctl 8 ,
to enable
.Em PaX MPROTECT
on a per-program basis.
.Pp
Example usage:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# paxctl +M /usr/sbin/sshd
.Ed
.Pp
Enabling
.Em PaX MPROTECT
globally:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl -w security.pax.mprotect.global=1
.Ed
.Ss PaX Segvguard
.Em PaX Segvguard
monitors the number of segfaults in a program per-user, in an attempt to
detect on-going exploitation attempts and possibly prevent them.
One common attack
.Em PaX Segvguard
can help mitigate is when an attacker tries to brute-force a function
return address, when wanting to perform a return-to-lib attack.
.Pp
.Em PaX Segvguard
makes use of kernel memory, so use it wisely.
While it provides rate-limiting protections, it works on a per-program
basis for keeping its records, meaning that irresponsible use may result
in keeping track of all segfaults in the system, easily wasting all kernel
memory.
.Pp
For this reason, it is highly recommended to have
.Em PaX Segvguard
enabled explicitly only for network services etc.
Enabling
.Em PaX Segvguard
explicitly works like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# paxctl +G /usr/sbin/sshd
.Ed
.Pp
However, a global knob is still provided, for use in strict environments
with no local users (some network appliances, embedded devices, firewalls,
etc.):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl -w security.pax.segvguard.global=1
.Ed
.Pp
.Em PaX Segvguard
can be configured to work in your preferred way.
For example, watching for 5 segfaults from the same user in a time-frame of
60 seconds:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl -w security.pax.segvguard.max_crashes=5
# sysctl -w security.pax.segvguard.expiry_timeout=60
.Ed
.Pp
The number of seconds a user will be suspended from running the culprit
program is also configurable.
For example, 10 minutes seem like a sane setting:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl -w security.pax.segvguard.suspend_timeout=600
.Ed
.Pp
Explicitly disabling
.Em PaX Segvguard
can be done like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# paxctl +g /bin/ls
.Ed
.Ss GCC Stack Smashing Protection ( SSP )
Since
.Nx 4.0 ,
.Xr gcc 1
includes
.Em SSP ,
a set of compiler extensions to raise the bar on exploitation attempts via
corruption of variables to affect program control flow or buffer overruns.
.Pp
Upon detection of a buffer overrun,
.Em SSP
will immediately abort execution of the program and send a log message
to
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The system (userland, kernel) can be built with
.Em SSP
by using the
.Dq USE_SSP
flag in
.Pa /etc/mk.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
USE_SSP=yes
.Ed
.Pp
You are encouraged to use
.Em SSP
for software you build, by providing one of the
.Fl fstack-protector
or
.Fl fstack-protector-all
flags to
.Xr gcc 1 .
Keep in mind, however, that
.Em SSP
will not work for functions that make use of
.Xr alloca 3 ,
as the latter modifies the stack size during run-time, while
.Em SSP
relies on it being a compile-time static.
.Pp
Use of
.Em SSP
is especially encouraged on platforms without per-page execute bit granularity
such as
.Em i386 .
.Sh INFORMATION FILTERING
.Nx
provides administrators with the ability to restrict information passed from
the kernel to userland so that users can only view information they
.Dq own .
.Pp
The hooks that manage that are located in various parts of the system and
effectively affect programs like
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr fstat 1 ,
and
.Xr netstat 1 .
To enable:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# sysctl -w security.curtain=1
