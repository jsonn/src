.Sh NAME
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Nd create system and device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fMs
.Op Fl m Ar mknod
.Op Fl p Ar pax
.Bro Ar special | device Brc Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create system and device special files.
As arguments it takes the names of known devices, like
.Ar sd0 ,
or of special targets, like
.Pa all
or
.Pa std ,
which create a collection of device special files,
or
.Pa local ,
which invokes
.Xr MAKEDEV.local 8
with the
.Pa all
argument.
.Pp
The script is in
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
and must be called from the
.Pa /dev
directory.
For the creation of the devices,
.Xr mknod 8
is used, which can only be used for creating devices by the
super-user.
The
.Xr mknod 8
used can be overridden by the
.Fl m
flag.
.Pp
Supported options are:
.Bl -tag -width XmXmknodXX
.It Fl f
Force permissions to be updated on existing devices.
This works only if
.Xr mknod 8
is used; it is not compatible with the
.Fl p
or
.Fl s
options.
.It Fl M
Create a memory file system, union mounted over the current directory,
to contain the device special files.
The memory file system is created using either
.Xr mount_tmpfs 8
or
.Xr mount_mfs 8 .
.Pp
If the
.Fl M
flag is specified more than once, then
.Nm
assumes that it is being invoked from
.Xr init 1
to populate a memory file system for
.Pa /dev .
In this case,
.Nm
will also redirect its output to the system console.
.It Fl m Ar mknod
Name of
.Xr mknod 8
program.
[Usually, $TOOL_MKNOD or mknod.]
.It Fl p Ar pax
Name of
.Xr pax 1
program.
[Usually, $TOOL_PAX or mknod.]
If this is specified, then instead of creating device nodes
one by one using
.Xr mknod 8 ,
.Nm
will create device nodes all at once using
.Xr pax 1 .
This is more efficient when many device nodes are involved.
.It Fl s
Generate
.Xr mtree 8
specfile instead of creating devices.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl m , Fl p ,
and
.Fl s
flags are mutually exclusive.
If none of these flags is specified, then
.Nm
will use the
.Xr pax 1
command if it appears to be usable, falling back to the
.Xr mknod 8
command if necessary.
.Pp
The special targets supported on
.Nx
are:

.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev MAKEDEV_AS_LIBRARY
If this is set, then
.Nm
will define several shell functions and then return,
ignoring all its command line options and arguments.
This is used to enable
.Xr MAKEDEV.local 8
to use the shell functions defined in
.Nm .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/MAKEDEV.local" -compact
.It Pa /dev
special device files directory
.It Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
script described in this man page
.It Pa /dev/MAKEDEV.local
script for site-specific devices
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If the script reports an error that is difficult to understand,
you can get more debugging output by using
.Dl Ic sh Fl x Ar MAKEDEV Ar argument .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
The ability to be used as a function library was added in
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh NOTES
Not all devices listed in this manpage are supported on all platforms.
.Pp
This man page is generated automatically from the same sources
as
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV ,
in which the device files are not always sorted, which may result
in an unusual (non-alphabetical) order.
.Pp
In order to allow a diskless
.Nx
client to obtain its
.Pa /dev
directory from a file server running a foreign operating system,
one of the following techniques may be useful to populate
a directory of device nodes on the foreign server:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If the foreign server is sufficiently similar to
.Nx ,
run
.Nm
in an appropriate directory of the foreign server,
using the
.Fl m
flag to refer to a script that converts from command line
arguments that would be usable with the
.Nx
.Xr mknod 8
command to the equivalent commands for the foreign server.
.It
Run
.Nm
with the
.Fl s
flag to generate an
.Xr mtree 8
specification file; this can be done on any host with a
POSIX-compliant shell and a few widely-available utilities.
Use the
.Xr pax 1
command with the
.Fl w Fl M
flags to convert the
.Xr mtree 8
specification file into an archive
in a format that supports device nodes
(such as
.Ar ustar
format);
this can be done on a
.Nx
host, or can be done in a cross-build environment using
.Sy TOOLDIR Ns Pa /bin/nbpax .
Finally, use apropriate tools on the foreign server
to unpack the archive and create the device nodes.
