.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_hpux
.Nd setup procedure for running HP-UX binaries
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
supports running HP-UX binaries.  This applies only to m68k systems (such
as hp300 systems). Most programs should work, such as Matlab 4.2c and the
HP-UX X11R5 server. Programs that will not work are fairly uncommon, and
often involve very low level hardware access.
.Pp
The HP-UX compatibility feature is active
for kernels compiled with the
.Dv COMPAT_HPUX
and
.Dv COMPAT_M68K4K
options enabled.  HP-UX for m68k uses 4 KB page sizes, and
.Nx
for all m68k platforms now use 8 KB page sizes.
.Pp
A lot of programs are dynamically linked. This means that you will
need the HP-UX shared libraries that the program depends on.
Also, you will need to create a
.Dq shadow root
directory for HP-UX binaries on your
.Nx
system. This directory
is named
.Pa /emul/hpux .
Any file operations done by HP-UX programs run under
.Nx
will look in this directory first. So, if a HP-UX
program opens, for example,
.Pa /etc/passwd ,
.Nx
will
first try to open
.Pa /emul/hpux/etc/passwd ,
and if that does not exist open the
.Sq real
.Pa /etc/passwd
file. It is recommended that you install
HP-UX packages that include configuration files etc. under
.Pa /emul/hpux ,
to avoid naming conflicts with possible
.Nx
counterparts. Shared
libraries should also be installed in the shadow tree.
.Pp
Generally, you will need to look for the shared libraries that HP-UX
binaries depend on only the first few times that you install a HP-UX
program on your
.Nx
system. After a while, you will have a sufficient
set of HP-UX shared libraries on your system to be able to run newly
imported HP-UX binaries without any extra work.
.Ss Setting up shared libraries
How to get to know which shared libraries HP-UX binaries need, and where
to get them? Basically, there are 2 possibilities (when following
these instructions: you will need to be root on your
.Nx
system to do the necessary installation steps).
.Bl -enum
.It
You must have login access to an HP-UX system.  These instructions apply to
HP-UX 9.10 (the latest version of HP-UX available for m68k-based systems),
although the instructions should be similar for earlier versions of HP-UX.
By far, the easiest method is to copy the essential files locally to your
.Nx
system.
.Pp
Use tar, or a similar utility to collect the following files:
.Bl -item -compact
.It
All files in the
.Pa /usr/lib
directory ending in
.Li ".sl" .
There should be about 46 files and two soft links.
.It
All files in the
.Pa /lib
directory ending in
.Li ".sl" .
There should be 5 files.
.El
.Pp
Now, you need to copy these files to your
.Nx
system, and extract them into
.Pa /emul/hpux ,
for example, you should end up with the following files:
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/dld.sl
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/libc.sl
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/libm.sl
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/libM.sl
.It
.Pa /emul/hpux/lib/libcurses.sl
.It
And a whole bunch of files in
.Pa /emul/hpux/usr/lib .
.El
Overall, HP-UX 9.10 has about 10 MB of shared libraries that you will have
ended up copying to your system.
.It
You have access to an HP-UX system with its entire root drive exported via NFS.
In this case, you simply mount the entire HP-UX system under
.Pa /emul/hpux .
For example, on your
.Nx
system, you might mount it as:
.Dl mount_nfs hpux-host.test.net:/ /emul/hpux
.El
.Ss Setting up X11R5
If you want to run the HP-UX X11R5 server instead of the X server that
comes with
.Nx ,
you will need to grab a few additional files:
.Bl -item -compact
.It
.Pa /usr/bin/X11/X
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/grmd
.It
The shared libraries in
.Pa /usr/lib/X11R5
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/Motif1.2/libXm.sl
.It
All the subdirectories and files in
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/fonts
.It
All the files in
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/nls/Xhp
.It
All the files in
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/extensions
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/XHPKeymaps
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/XHPmodmap
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/XPCmodmap
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/Xconsoles
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/X0screens
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/X0devices
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/X0pointerkeys
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/rgb.dir
.It
.Pa /usr/lib/X11/rgb.pag
.El
.Pp
You'll also need to perform a few configuration steps:
.Bl -enum
.It
Get and extract the
.Pa xbase.tgz
set for your version of
.Nx
to provide the X11R6 clients you'll be using with your new X server.
.It
Create the following directory for the X server to deposit its socket files
in:
.Dl mkdir -p /usr/spool/sockets/X11
.Dl chmod 777 /usr/spool/sockets/X11
.It
Add the following lines to your
.Pa /etc/rc.local
to create the necessary directories for the X server to deposit its files in,
when your system boots:
.Dl mkdir /tmp/.X11-unix
.Dl chmod 777 /tmp/.X11-unix
.Dl ln -s /usr/spool/sockets/X11/0 /tmp/.X11-unix/X0
.It
To allow the X server to beep, you need to link some device names together:
.Dl ln -s /dev/hil0 /dev/rhil
.It
You may also want to link your X server to a more convenient location, such as:
.Dl ln -s /emul/hpux/usr/bin/X /usr/X11R6/bin/X
.El

.Sh BUGS
See PR kern/6042 on why you must create directories for sockets outside
of the
.Pa /emul/hpux
directory tree when running the HP-UX X server.
.Pp
You may not be able to run the X server on multiple framebuffers, even though
both the X server and
.Nx
support them.
