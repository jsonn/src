.Dt BINSTALL 8 sparc
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm /usr/mdec/binstall
.Nd install sparc and sparc64 boot blocks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl htUuv
.Op Fl b Ar bootprog
.Op Fl f Ar filesystem
.Op Fl m Ar mdec
.Op Fl i Ar installbootprog
.Oo
.Dq net
.Ns \&|
.Dq ffs
.Oc
.Op directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program prepares a sparc or sparc64 system for booting, either from local
disk from a
.Dq ffs
partition or over the network.  The default type of boot block installed
is derived from the host system.  If it is an UltraSPARC, the sparc64
boot blocks will be used, otherwise the SPARC boot blocks will be used.
.Nm
can be forced to prepare a disk for either.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width 123456
.It Fl b
Set the second stage boot program to
.Ar bootprog .
This will typically be
.Pa boot.net
for sparc systems and
.Pa ofwboot.net
for sparc64 systems.
.It Fl f
Set the path to the filesystem being installed for to
.Ar filesystem .
This is otherwise derived from the
.Op directory .
.It Fl h
Display help.
.It Fl i
Set the path to the
.Xr installboot 8
program to
.Ar installbootprog .
This is useful for using
.Nm
on non-sparc or sparc64 systems.
.It Fl m
Sets the path to the machine dependent directory to
.Ar mdec .
This is the directory that both the boot blocks and the
.Xr installboot 8
program live.
.It Fl t
Test mode; does not run any program.  Implies the
.Fl v
option.
.It Fl U
Install sparc (SPARC) boot blocks.
.It Fl u
Install sparc64 (UltraSPARC) boot blocks.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
