.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd Alpha system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When the
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha
kernel is booted normally
it initializes itself and proceeds to start the system.  An automatic
consistency check of the file systems takes place, and unless this
fails, the system comes up to multi-user operation.  The proper way
to shut the system down is with the
.Xr shutdown 8
command.
.Pp
If the system crashes, it will enter the kernel debugger,
.Xr ddb 8 ,
if it is configured in the kernel.
If the crash occurred during
initialization and the debugger is not present or is exited, the
kernel will halt the system.
If the crash occurred during normal operation and the debugger
is not present or is exited, the system will attempt a dump to the
configured dump device (which will be automatically recovered with
.Xr savecore 8
during the next boot cycle), and after the dump is complete (successful
or not) the kernel will attempt a reboot.

The device names used by
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha
and the
.Tn SRM Console
often have no relation to each other.
