.Sh BUGS
This manual page was created from the list at the top of the
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha
shell script.  That script's comments may be incorrect, and
this manual page must be kept in sync with them, so it may be
even more incorrect.  At the very least, the ordering of device
names in that file seems almost random.
