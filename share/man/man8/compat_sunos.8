.Sh NAME
.Nm COMPAT_SUNOS
.Nd setup procedure for m68k and sparc architectures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
NetBSD/sparc and some of the NetBSD/m68k architectures can run
SunOS executables. Most executables will work.
.Pp
The exceptions include programs that use the SunOS kvm library,
and various system calls, ioctl()'s, or kernel semantics
that are difficult to emulate.
The number of reasons why a program might fail to work is (thankfully)
longer than the number of programs that fail to run.
.Pp
Static executables will normally run without any extra setup.
This procedure details the directories and files that must be
setup to allow dynamically linked executables to work.
.Pp
The files you need are on your Sun machine.
You need to worry about the legal issues of ensuring that you
have a right to use the required files on your machine.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 123 -compact
.It 1.
On your NetBSD machine, do the following:
.nf
mkdir /sun
mkdir /sun/lib
mkdir /sun/5lib
ln -s /sun/5lib /usr/5lib
.fi
.Pp
.It 2.
cp
.Pa SunOS:/usr/lib/lib*.so.*.*
.Pa NetBSD:/sun/lib
.Pp
.It 3.
cp
.Pa SunOS:/usr/5lib/lib*.so.*.*
.Pa NetBSD:/sun/5lib
.Pp
.It 4.
cp 
.Pa SunOS:/usr/lib/ld.so
.Pa NetBSD:/usr/lib/ld.so
.Pp
.It 5.
On your NetBSD machine, edit the
.Pa ld.so
binary using a binary editor.
In the binary, change every occurance of a path that starts with
.Pa /usr
so that it starts with
.Pa /sun .
Note that the strings "/usr" and "/sun" are the same length.
.Pp
.It 6.
If you ever expect to use YP, you will want to create a link:
.nf
ln -s /var/run/ypbind.lock /etc/ypbind.lock
.fi
.El
.Pp
This will place the SunOS libraries on your NetBSD machine
in a location where they do not conflict with the standard libraries,
and also teach the SunOS dynamic linker to search for the SunOS
dynamic libraries in that place.
.Pp
.Sh BUGS
A list of things which fail to work in compatibility mode should
be here.
