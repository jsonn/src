.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_pecoff
.Nd setup procedure for running Win32 applications (a.k.a. PEACE)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
has partial support for running Win32 application.
This manual page describes how to run Win32 (and hopefully WinCE
in the future) applications on
.Nx .
Note that PE (Portable Executable) is Microsoft extention to COFF
executable file format.

.Sh BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO WIN32 API
Win32 API is an application program interface (API) for 32-bit
applications for Microsoft Windows 9x/NT/2000.  Win32 API is provided
via a set of core DLLs (Dynamically Linked Libraries), including KERNEL32.DLL,
USER32.DLL and GDI32.DLL.  
.Pp
Structure of these core DLLs and the interface between the
operating system kernel and userland is implementation-dependent.
Each implementation must provide their own core DLLs.
Therfore, these DLLs are different between Windows 98 and Windows 2000.
.Pp
KERNEL32.DLL is used by all Win32 applications; it provides basic
kernel interface such as file access, process control, memory management etc.
.Pp
USER32.DLL is used by most Win32 applications; it provides basic
userland functions such as GUI and messaging.
.Pp
GDI32.DLL provides functions to draw images and characters.
.Pp
SHELL32.DLL is the Windows shell support, including file association.
.Pp
COMCTL32.DLL and COMDLG.32.DLL are GUI components which are commonly
used in many applications.  WSOCK32.DLL provides networking API.
DDRAW.DLL is for DirectDraw.
.Pp
Most of other DLLs are compatible among all the implementations and
therefore can be shared.

.Sh NETBSD SUPPORT FOR WIN32 API
.Nx
support for Win32 application is developed by the PEACE Project, and is
under active development.
Currently it can run some console applications including Windows 2000
CMD.EXE, and very few GUI applications.
.Pp
PEACE system consists of three parts; kernel part, dynamic loader and
core DLLs.
.Pp
The kernel part provides loading and executing PE/COFF format 
executable binaries, i.e. it extends
.Xr execve 2
system call, just like other binary compatibility options.
It is activated by enabling
.Dv COMPAT_PECOFF
option.
.Pp
The dynamic loader is PE/COFF version of
.Xr ld.so 1 .
It reads the file header of the executable binary, and
loads required DLLs.  
.Pp
The core DLLs implement the actual Win32 API functions described in the
previous section.  Since the kernel part does not provide
any additional system calls and other kernel interface,
all Win32 API functions are implemented on top of the existing
.Nx
APIs (system calls and standard libraries such as libc and libX11).

.Sh PREPARING PEACE DYNAMIC LOADER AND CORE DLLS
Development snapshots of the dynamic loader can be retrieved from 
.Pa http://chiharu.haun.org/peace/dist/peace-i386-ld.so.dll-*.gz ,
where `*' is replaced with the snapshot date.
Simply
.Xr gunzip 1
the file and copy the resultant as
.Pa /usr/libexec/ld.so.dll .
.Pp
The core DLLs can also be retrieved from
.Pa http://chiharu.haun.org/peace/dist/peace-i386-dll-*.tgz .
The dynamic loader searches required DLLs from the following directories;
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
.Pa /usr/lib
.It
Directories listed in the environment variable DLLPATH (separated by
colons)
.It
Same directory where the executable is located
.El
The core DLLs are required to be installed into
.Pa /usr/lib ,
in order to use CMD.EXE (or another Win32 application) as the login shell.
.Pp
Other DLLs can be stored into arbitrary directories specified by the
environment variable DLLPATH.  To use Windows NT/2000
DLLs installed on a separate partition of the local disk directly
for
.Nx ,
type
.Bd -literal -compact -offset indent
mount -t ntfs -o ro /dev/wd0h /nthd
setenv DLLPATH /nthd/WINNT/SYSTEM32:/nthd/WINNT
.Ed
(assuming csh).

.Sh HISTORY
Kernel support for PE/COFF appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .

.Sh AUTHOR
Implementation of Win32 binary compatibility support for
.Nx
was started by Masaru Oki.
The PEACE Project is founded by him to implement enormous number of functions
in Win32/WinCE API.

.Sh BUGS
.Bl -hyphen -compact
.It
Currently only i386 platform is supported.
.It
Most functions in Win32 are missing.
.It
The dynamic loader and core DLLs are not provided in the standard
distribution of
.Nx .
This is because the cross-compiler is required to build them.
