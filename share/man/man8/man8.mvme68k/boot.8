.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery.
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed
as described in
.Xr fsck 8 .
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts from disk
The disk-boot program (/usr/mdec/bootsd) will attempt to load
.Pa netbsd
from partition A of the boot device,
which must currently be an ``sd'' disk.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts from tape
The tape-boot program (/usr/mdec/bootst) will attempt to load
.Pa netbsd
from a SCSI tape drive.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts over a network
The network boot program (/usr/mdec/netboot) will load
.Pa netbsd
from the NFS root as determined by the procedure described in
.Xr diskless 8 .
Note that the MVME147 is unable to boot directly from the
network without the help of a small bootloader program
(/usr/mdec/sboot).
.Pp
The
.Op Fl s
flag to the boot loader will bring the system up in single-user mode.
The
.Op Fl a
flag instructs the system to prompt for the location of the root filesystem
and the primary swap partition.
The
.Op Fl d
flag to the boot loader will bring the system up in debug mode.
Here it waits for a kernel debugger connect; see
.Xr ddb 4 .
Any extra flags or arguments, the after the -- separator,
.Ar <boot string>
are passed to the boot prom.
Other flags are currently ignored.
.Pp
At any time you can break to the kernel debugger
.Xr ddb 4
(assuming
.Sy options DDB
was specified in the kernel configuration file)
by sending a serial line BREAK character.
If you do this accidentally you can continue whatever was in progress
by typing `c' followed by the return key.
