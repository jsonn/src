.Sh DESCRIPTION
The shell script
.Nm MAKEDEV ,

.Nm MAKEDEV
takes any number of device names as arguments,
where the names are the common abbreviation for
the device.  There are three special device names,
.Ar all ,
.Ar std
and
.Ar local .
If
given,
.Ar all
creates device files for all devices on the Atari.  If units are
expected for a device
.Nm MAKEDEV
supplies the standard numbers.
The
.Ar std
argument creates the standard devices for the Atari.
Finally
.Ar local
is for devices specific to the local site, and
executes the shell file
.Pa MAKEDEV.local .
.Pp
The Atari supports the following devices.
Where a device name is followed by a hash
sign ("#"), the hash sign must be replaced
by a unit number.
