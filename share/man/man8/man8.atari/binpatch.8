.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Fl T Ar saddr
.Fl s Ar symname
.Op Fl r Ar value
.Ar binfile
.Nm binpatch
.Op Fl b | Fl w | Fl l | Fl d

.Op Fl T Ar saddr
.Fl a Ar addr
.Op Fl r Ar value
.Ar binfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to modify or examine the data associated with a symbol in a binary
file
.Ar binfile .
.Pp
The flags
.Fl b ,
.Fl w ,
.Fl l ,
and
.Fl d
specify the size of the data to be modified or examined.
.Fl b
is for 8bit
.Pq Li int8_t ,
.Fl w
is for 16bit
.Pq Li int16_t ,
.Fl l
is for 32bit
.Pq Li int32_t ,
and
.Fl d
is for 64bit
.Pq Li int64_t
variables.
.Pp
The
.Ar binfile
is scanned in search of the symbol
.Ar symname
(specified with the
.Fl s
flag).
If the symbol is found the current data and address are printed.
.Pp
Next if the
.Fl r
flag has been given, the current data is replaced with that of
.Ar value .
.Pp
If the second form is used the address
.Ar addr
specified with the
.Fl a
flag is used as a direct address into the data section of the binary and
no symbol search is performed.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
flag specifies an offset in
.Li int8_t ,
.Li int16_t ,
.Li int32_t ,
and
.Li int64_t
.Fl ( b ,
.Fl w ,
.Fl l ,
or
.Fl d )
units from the given locator
.Fl ( s
or
.Fl a )
for
.Nm
to perform its described actions.
This might be useful to patch a member of array or structure.
.Pp
The
.Fl T
flag is used to specify the starting address of a.out binary text segment.
Ignored for other binary executable formats.

.Xr mdsetimage 8
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
command doesn't check if size of specified symbol is the same as the
specified size by
.Fl b ,
.Fl w ,
.Fl l ,
or
.Fl d
flag.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command doesn't check if specified address or symbol is a patchable variable
and it might corrupt the specified executable binary.
