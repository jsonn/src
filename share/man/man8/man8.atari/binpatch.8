.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm binpatch
is used to modify or examine the data associated with a symbol in a binary
file
.Ar binfile .
The flags
.Fl b ,
.Fl w
and
.Fl l
specify the size of the data to be modified or examined
(byte, word and long respectively.) The
.Ar binfile
is scanned in search of the symbol
.Ar symname
(specified with the
.Fl s
flag)
If the symbol is found the current data and address are printed.  Next if the
.Fl r
flag has been given, the current data is replaced with that of
.Ar value .
.Pp
If the second form is used the address
.Ar addr
specified with the
.Fl a
flag is used as a direct address into the data section of the binary and
no symbol search is performed.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
flag specifies an offset in byte, word or long (
.Fl b
,
.Fl w
,
or
.Fl l
) units from the given locator (
.Fl s
or
.Fl a
) for
.Nm binpatch
to perform it's described actions.
