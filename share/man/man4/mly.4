.Sh NAME
.Nm mly
.Nd Mylex AcceleRAID/eXtremeRAID family driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mly* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at mly?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Mylex AcceleRAID and eXtremeRAID family
of PCI to SCSI RAID controllers with version 6.00 and later
firmware.
Supported controllers include:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
AcceleRAID 160
.It
AcceleRAID 170
.It
AcceleRAID 352
.It
eXtremeRAID 2000
.It
eXtremeRAID 3000
.El
.Pp
Compatible Mylex controllers not listed should work, but have not been
tested.
.Pp
Logical devices (disk arrays) attached to the controller are presented
to the SCSI subsystem as though they were direct-access devices on a
virtual SCSI bus.
Physical devices which are not claimed by a logical
device are presented on SCSI channels which match the physical channels
on the controller.
.Pp
The results of the SCSI ``INQUIRY'' command from logical devices are
overwritten with status information by the
.Nm
driver.  The vendor field is the string ``MYLEX'', the product field
indicates the type of logical device, and the revision field contains a four
letter status code.  The possible status codes and their meanings are as
follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXX -compact
.It OFLN
offline
.It UNCF
unconfigured
.It ONLN
online - optimal
.It CRIT
critical - one or more disks in the array has failed
.It NORD
write only
.It STBY
standby
.It MISS
missing
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Ss Controller initialization phase
.Bl -diag
.It "mly%d: controller initialization started"
.It "mly%d: initialization complete"
.Pp
The controller firmware has started initialization.
Normally this process is performed by the controller BIOS,
but the driver may need
to do this in cases where the BIOS has failed, or is not compatible
(e.g. on non-x86 systems).
.It "mly%d: drive spinup in progress"
.Pp
Drive startup is in progress; this may take several minutes.
.It "mly%d: mirror race recovery failed, one or more drives offline"
.It "mly%d: mirror race recovery in progress"
.It "mly%d: mirror race recovery on a critical drive"
.Pp
These error codes are undocumented.
.It "mly%d: FATAL MEMORY PARITY ERROR"
.Pp
Firmware detected a fatal memory error; the driver will not attempt to
attach to this controller.
.It "mly%d: unknown initialization code %x"
.Pp
An unknown error occurred during initialization; it will be ignored.

.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 ,
and was based on the
.Fx
driver of the same name.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver currently assumes that all busses support at most 16 targets and 1
logical unit per target.
.Pp
Enclosures are not named or otherwise identified in event messages.
.Pp
The transfer speed for devices is always reported to the kernel as 20MHz.
