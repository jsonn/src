.Sh NAME
.Nm xmd
.Nd XIP memory disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device xmd" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver enables use of system or user memory as a disk, which can be
mounted as XIP (eXecute-In-Place), so that filesystem data are read
without consuming intermediate page cache buffers.
.Pp
Memory for the disk is allocated within the kernel and set with
.Xr mdsetimage 8
before the
.Nm
device may be used as a disk.
.Nm
disks should be mounted as read-only to enable XIP.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr md 4 ,
.Xr options 4 ,
.Xr mdsetimage 8
.Sh BUGS
Due to the design of XIP, device pages in a physical segment must
be contiguous.
This leads to a restriction that the page array in the
.Nm
driver must be also contiguous.
It is highly expectable that the
.Nm
kernel module will not work.
