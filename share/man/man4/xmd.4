.Nm xmd
.Nd XIP memory disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device xmd" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver enables use of system or user memory as a disk, which can be
mounted as XIP (eXecute-In-Place), so that filesystem data are read
without consuming intermediate page cache buffers.
.Pp
Memory for the disk is allocated within the kernel and set with
.Xr mdsetimage 8
before the
.Nm
device may be used as a disk.
.Nm
disks should be mounted as read-only to enable XIP.
