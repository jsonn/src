.Dt VERIEXEC 4
.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexec
.Nd Veriexec pseudo-device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device veriexec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
pseudo-device is used to interface the kernel's Veriexec data-structures.
It is used to size the kernel data structures and load the Veriexec
fingerprints into kernel memory.
.Ss Veriexec file operations
All the following operations are invoked using the
.Xr ioctl 2
system call.
Refer to that man page for the description of the
.Em request
and
.Em argp
parameters.
The following section lists the requests that can be made via
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Ss Veriexec file request descriptions
.Bl -tag -width VERIEXEC_TABLESIZE
.It Dv VERIEXEC_TABLESIZE Fa struct veriexec_sizing_params
Sizes the in kernel hash tables to accommodate the fingerprint entries.
This request must be made prior to loading the fingerprints into the
kernel.
The argument structure contains the device to which the hash table relates
and the number of fingerprint entries that will be loaded into the
kernel for the device.
.It Dv VERIEXEC_LOAD Fa struct veriexec_params
Inserts a fingerprint into the in-kernel tables.
These tables must have been previously sized using the
.Dv VERIEXEC_TABLESIZE
request.
The argument structure is, as defined in
.Pa /usr/include/sys/verified_exec.h :
.Bd -literal
struct veriexec_params  {
        unsigned char type;
        unsigned char fp_type[VERIEXEC_TYPE_MAXLEN];
        char file[MAXPATHLEN];
        unsigned int size;
        unsigned char *fingerprint;
};
.Ed
.Pp
Where type contains the type of access allowed, which may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width VERIEXEC_INDIRECT
.It Dv VERIEXEC_DIRECT
Allow execution of the file if fingerprint matches.
.It Dv VERIEXEC_INDIRECT
Allow execution of the file as a script interpreter only, direct command
line invocation is disallowed.
.It Dv VERIEXEC_FILE
The file is a plain file, not an executable.
.El
.Pp
Followed by fp_type, which is the fingerprint type.
This is a case-insensitive character string that must match one of
the fingerprint types supported by the running kernel.
Next the path to the file to which the fingerprint applies.
The field size is the number of bytes contained in the
fingerprint, this is used by the kernel to provide a simple sanity check
on the fingerprint passed.
Lastly, the fingerprint is a pointer to an
array of characters that comprise the fingerprint for the file.
.El
.Pp
Note that the requests
.Dv VERIEXEC_TABLESIZE
and
.Dv VERIEXEC_LOAD
are not permitted once the kernel security level has been raised past 0
by setting
.Dv kern.securelevel
using
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
.Xr veriexecctl 8
.Sh NOTES
The size field in the
.Dv VERIEXEC_LOAD
structure is only used to validate that the size of the fingerprint being
passed is the expected size for that fingerprint hash type; it is not used
for any other purpose.
A malicious person could deliberately mismatch the size of the fingerprint
array and, possibly, cause a kernel page fault panic when the kernel
reads the input fingerprint array memory.
Due to this, it is recommended only the root user be allowed to access
this device.
