.Sh NAME
.Nm pss
.Nd Personal Sound System hardware audio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pss0 at isa?"
.Cd "sp0 at pss? port 0x530 irq 10 drq 0"
.Cd "audio* at sp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports soundcards based on ESC614 or ESC614A ASICs and AD1848
or CS4231 series codecs.  Known examples are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It Cardinal Digital Sound Pro 16
.It Orchid SoundWave 32
.El
.Pp
The Orchid GameWave 32 is based on the ESC614 ASIC, but is not
supported because it does not have a codec.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver uses the Windows Sound System emulation mode of the ASIC.
It is a half-duplex device.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr wss 4
.Sh BUGS
This driver doesn't work yet.
.Pp
The list of cards using the PSS chipset is incomplete.
.Pp
The ESC614 (version 1) is unable to reliably determine whether DMA
channels are free on some motherboards.  The ASIC determines that all
channels are taken, even if that is untrue.  When this happens, the driver
cannot verify configured DMA channels with the ASIC's DMA autodetect
hardware, so it blindly accepts the user setting.
.Pp
Cards based on the ESC615 ASIC are not supported.
.Pp
The MIDI port, joystick, and CD-ROM drive (if present) are not supported.
