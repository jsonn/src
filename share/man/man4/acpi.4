.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support for
.Tn ACPI
devices and includes several
.Tn ACPI
device drivers.
.Pp
The
.Nx
implementation of
.Tn ACPI
integrates Intel's ACPI Component Architecture
(aka ACPI-CA) for the OS-independent part.
The ACPI-CA provides
OS-neutral ACPI functionalities such as ACPI BIOS table support,
an ACPI event framework and an AML (ACPI Machine Language) interpreter.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width ACPI_ACTIVATE_DEV -offset 3n
.It Nm ACPI_DEBUG
Enable ACPI debugging message outputs.
.It Nm ACPI_PCI_FIXUP
Enable ACPI-based PCI interrupt routing fixup.
If you have PCI interrupt related problem, try this option.
.It Nm ACPI_ACTIVATE_DEV
Determine if the ACPI driver should attempt to activate
inactive devices.
The default is off.
.It Nm ACPICA_PEDANTIC
Force strict conformance to the ACPI specification in the
ACPI-CA.
Do not enable this option unless you are debugging.
