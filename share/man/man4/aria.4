The

which is the basis of such cards as the Prometheus Aria 16, the
Genoa AudioBahn 16 Pro, and some Diamond Sonic Sounds (Rev A5 and
Rev B2).
.Pp
The Sierra Aria chipset is full-duplex and is capable of 8- and
16- bit audio sample recording and playback at 7875 Hz, 11025 Hz,
15750 Hz, 22050 Hz, 31500 Hz, and 44100 Hz.
.Pp
Valid I/O addresses are 0x280, 0x290, 0x2A0, and 0x2B0.
The IRQ may be set to 10, 11, or 12.
.Pp
The flags setting is necessary for
the Prometheus Aria 16, as it needs to be specially
configured at each cold boot by twiddling with the
joystick port.
.Sh BUGS
DMA is not yet supported.
.Pp
The flags option should not be unnecessary.
