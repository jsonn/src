.Sh NAME
.Nm gsip
.Nd National Semiconductor DP83820 Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gsip* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs may also be necessary.  See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Gigabit Ethernet interfaces based on the
National Semiconductor DP83820 Gigabit Ethernet chips.
.Pp
The National Semiconductor DP83820 is found on NetGear GA-622,
Asante FriendlyNet GigaNIX, D-Link DGE-500T, SMC 9452TX and 9462TX,
Accton EN1407-T, Planex GN-1000TE, ARK SOHO GA2000T and GA2500T,
and other low-cost Gigabit Ethernet
cards.  It uses an external PHY or an external 10-bit interface.
.Pp
The DP83820 supports VLAN tag insertion/removal in hardware.  The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.
.Pp
The DP83820 supports IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming in hardware.  The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.  See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.
.Pp
The DP83820 chip is a close relative of the DP83815 10/100 Ethernet
chip, which is supported by the
.Xr sip 4
driver, hence the
.Nm
name.
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" XXX too be done.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jason R. Thorpe
.Aq thorpej@netbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not support the 10-bit interface, which is required in
order to support fiber-optic media.
