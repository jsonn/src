.Sh NAME
.Nm jmide
.Nd JMicron Technology JMB36x PCIe to SATA II/PATA controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "jmide* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "ahcisata* at jmide?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the JMicron Technology JMB36x IDE controllers.
.Pp
These PCI-e controllers exist if different flavours (1 or 2 PATA Ultra/133
ports and/or 1 or 2 SATA-II ports), and are highly flexible.
The SATA ports can be attached to the integrated AHCI controller or
attached to the PCI IDE channels in PATA emulation, in either single-drive
emulation on each PCI IDE channels, or in master/slave emulation on one of the
PCI IDE channels.
.Pp
When enabled, the AHCI controller can either be on the PCI function 0 or
function 2.
The PCI IDE controller can also be on either PCI function, and
can share the PCI function with AHCI.
The
.Nm
driver supports both the AHCI controller and PCI IDE controller in various
configurations.
