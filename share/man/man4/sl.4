.Sh NAME
.Nm sl
.Nd Serial Line IP (SLIP) network interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device sl
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface allows asynchronous serial lines to be used as
.Tn IPv4
network interfaces using the
.Tn SLIP
protocol.
The
.Nm
interface can use Van Jacobson
.Tn TCP
header compression and
.Tn ICMP
filtering.
.Pp
However,
.Tn SLIP
can only transmit
.Tn IPv4
packets between preconfigured hosts on an asynchronous serial link.
It has no provision for address negotiation,
carriage of additional protocols (e.g.
.Tn XNS ,
.Tn AppleTalk ,
.Tn DECNET ) ,
and is not designed for synchronous serial links.
This is why
.Tn SLIP
has been superseded by the Point-to-Point Protocol
.Pq Tn PPP ,
which does all of those things, and much more.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It sl%d: af%d not supported .
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.
