.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to evbarm special files and hardware support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The evbarm port is really a collection of ports of
.Nx
to a range of development and evaluation boards based on the ARM Architecture.
.Pp
This section describes the supported boards, the special files,
related driver functions, and networking support available in each system.
In this part of the manual, the
.Tn SYNOPSIS
section of
each configurable device gives a sample specification
for use in constructing a system description for the
.Xr config 1
program.
The
.Tn DIAGNOSTICS
section lists messages which may appear on the console
and/or in the system error log
.Pa /var/log/messages
due to errors in device operation;
see
.Xr syslogd 8
for more information.
.Pp
This section contains both devices
which may be configured into the system
and network related information.
The networking support is introduced in
.Xr netintro 4 .
.Sh SUPPORTED BOARDS
Each supported board requires a custom kernel for that board.
.Pp
The following boards are currently supported by the evbarm configuration:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Integrator -offset indent -compact
.It Integrator
The Integrator/AP development system from ARM Ltd.
Supported processor boards
include the CM10200E and CM920T.
.It IQ80310
The reference platform for the XScale-based IOP310 I/O processor from Intel.
.It IQ80321
The reference platform for the XScale-based IOP321 I/O processor from Intel.
.It Npwr
The Npwr board, from Team ASA, is based on the IOP310 processor from Intel and
targetted at the network-attached storage space.
.It IXM1200
The reference platform for the XScale-based IXP1200 Network processor from
Intel.
.It SMDK2410
The reference platform for the ARM920T-based S3C2410 processor from Samsung.
.It SMDK2800
The reference platform for the ARM920T-based S3C2800 processor from Samsung.
.It BRH
The BRH (Big Red Head) is an evaluation and development platform from ADI
Engineering, based on the XScale-based I80200 processor
.It NTNP425B
An evaluation and development platform from NOVATEC, using the XScale-based
IXP425 processor.
.It DBPXA250
An evaluation and development platfrom from Intel, using the XScale-based
PXA250 processor.
.It TS7200
The TS-7200 is a single-board computer from Technologic Systems,
and is based on the Cirrus Logic EP9302.
.El
.Sh DEVICE SUPPORT
This section describes some of the hardware supported on the various boards.
Software support for these devices comes in two forms.
A hardware
device may be supported with a character or block
.Em device driver ,
or it may be used within the networking subsystem and have a
.Em network interface driver .
Block and character devices are accessed through files in the file
system of a special type; see
.Xr mknod 8 .
Network interfaces are indirectly accessed through the interprocess
communication facilities provided by the system; see
.Xr socket 2 .
.Pp
A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time
and the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled
into the system.
When the resultant system is booted, the
autoconfiguration facilities in the system probe for the device
and, if found, enable the software support for it.
If a device does not respond at autoconfiguration
time it is not accessible at any time afterwards.
To enable a device which did not autoconfigure,
the system must be rebooted.
.Pp
The autoconfiguration system is described in
.Xr autoconf 4 .
A list of the supported devices is given below.
.Sh LIST OF DEVICES

the system.
