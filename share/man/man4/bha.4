.Cd "bha* at eisa? slot ?"
.Cd "bha* at pci? dev ? function ?"

.Sh BUGS
The Buslogic BT-930 is not supported in this driver.
.Pp
The Buslogic BT-445S has a problem in early hardware and firmware
revisions which prevents proper operation on a system with more than
16MB of RAM.  Hardware revision D and firmware revision 3.37 should
be considered minimum requirements for using this board on systems
configured in this manner.
