.Sh NAME
.Nm svwsata
.Nd Serverworks Serial ATA disk controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "svwsata* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Serverworks K2, Frodo4, Frodo8 and HT-1000 Serial ATA
controllers, and provides the interface with the hardware for the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
.Pp
The 0x0002 flag forces the
.Nm
driver to disable DMA on chipsets for which DMA would normally be
enabled.
This can be used as a debugging aid, or to work around
problems where the SATA controller is wired up to the system incorrectly.
