.Sh NAME
.Nm neo
.Nd NeoMagic MagicMedia 256 audio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "neo*   at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "audio* at neo?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the NeoMagic MagicMedia 256AV and 256ZX
AC'97 audio devices, found on many laptops.
.Pp
The MagicMedia 256AV also comes in a variant (usually found on Dell
and HP laptops) that works in Windows Sound System emulation mode,
not in AC'97 mode.  That variant of the chip must be used with the
.Xr wss 4
driver.  The
.Nm
driver will not attach to such chips.
.Sh BUGS
The MagicMedia 256 series is not well-documented.
.Pp
No MIDI or FM synthesizer capability is provided with the MagicMedia 256
in AC'97 mode.  While those capabilities are provided by the Windows driver
for the chip, they are emulated by the Windows driver, and not directly
supported by the hardware.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
