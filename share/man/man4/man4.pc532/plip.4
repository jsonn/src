.Sh NAME
.Nm plip
.Nd "Option for the lpt driver to allow IP over centronics ports"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options PLIP"
.Cd "options COMPAT_PLIP10"
.Cd "options COMPAT_PLIP11"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides a way to transport IP over centronics ports.
Protocols to communicate with Linux 1.0 and Linux 1.1 hosts are provided.
By default the 1.1 protocol is used. To choose the 1.0 protocol use
the link0 flag with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your /etc/hostname.plip? file. In order to use the 1.0 protocol
the kernel has to be compiled with COMPAT_PLIP10.
.br
The COMPAT_PLIP11 option selects a default MTU of 1486 bytes. This is
necessary to work around a bug that is present in the plip code for
Linux 1.1.x and Linux 1.2.x.
.Sh NOTES
To connect two computers a "Laplink parallel cabel" is used:

.sp
In both protocol versions ethernet frames are used. The 1.0 protocol assings
an ethernet address of the form FD:FD:ww:xx:yy:zz to the interface. The 1.1
protocol uses FC instead of FD. ww, xx, yy and zz are taken from the internet
address ww.xx.yy.zz of the interface. Ethernet support has
to be configured into the kernel in order to use the
.Nm
interface.
