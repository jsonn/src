.Sh NAME
.Nm mgnsc
.Nd Magnum low level SCSI interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mgnsc0 at zbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn Amiga
architecture uses a common machine independent scsi sub-system
provided in the kernel source.  The machine independent 
drivers that use this code access the hardware through a
common interface. (see
.Xr scsibus 4 )
This common interface interacts with a machine dependent interface,
such as
.Nm mgnsc ,
which then handles the hardware specific issues.
.Pp
The
.Nm 
interface handles things such as DMA and interrupts as well as
actually sending commands, negotiating synchronous or asynchronous
transfers and handling disconnect/reconnect of SCSI targets.
The hardware that 
.Nm
uses is based on the NCR53c710 SCSI chip.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It mgnsc%s: abort %s: dstat %02x, sstat0 %02x sbcl %02x
The scsi operation %s was aborted due to error.  Dstat, sstat and
sbcl are registers within the NCR53c710 SCSI chip.
.It siop id %d reset\n"
The NCR53c710 SCSI chip has been reset and configure at id %d.
.It SIOP interrupt: %x sts %x msg %x sbcl %x
The NCR53c710 SCSI chip has interrupted unexpectedly.
.It SIOP: SCSI Gross Error
The NCR53c710 SCSI chip has indicated that it is confused.
.It SIOP: Parity Error
The NCR53c710 SCSI chip has indicated that it has detected a
parity error on the SCSI bus.
