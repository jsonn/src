.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd Ethernet driver for AMD7990(LANCE) and AMD 79C960  based boards 
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at zbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990 and 79C960
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following Zorro II expansion cards:
.Bl -tag -width "AMERISTAR" -offset indent
.It Em A2065
Commodore's ethernet card, manufacturer\ 514, product\ 112
.It Em AMERISTAR
Ameristar's ethernet card, manufacturer\ 1053, product\ 1
.It Em ARIADNE
Village Tronic's ethernet card, manufacturer\ 2167, product\ 201
.El
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The A2065 and Ameristar ethernet cards supports only manual media selection.
.Pp
The Ariadne card supports a software media selection for it's two
different connectors:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It 10Base2/BNC
also known as thinwire-ethernet
.It 10BaseT/UTP
also known as twisted pair
.El
.Pp
The Ariadne card uses an autoselect between UTP and BNC, so it uses UTP when an
active UTP line is connected or otherwise BNC.
To control this choice, use the following flag combinations with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your /etc/hostname.le? file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It \ media auto
Use the autoselect between UTP and BNC (default).
.It \ media BNC
Use the BNC port.
.It \ media UTP
Use the UTP port.
.El
.Pp
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Tn Amiga
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 1.0
.Pp
The Ariadne ethernet card first appeared with the
.Tn Amiga
ae interface in
.Nx 1.1
and was converted to the
.Tn Amiga
.Nm
interface in
.Nx 1.3
