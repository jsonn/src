.Nd Miscellaneous kernel configuration options
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd cinclude ...
.Cd config ...
.Cd [no] file-system ...
.Cd ident ...
.Cd include ...
.Cd [no] makeoptions ...
.Cd maxusers ...
.Cd [no] options ...
.Cd [no] pseudo-device ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes a number of miscellaneous kernel
configuration options that may be specified in a kernel config
file.
See
.Xr config 8
for information on how to configure and build kernels.
.Pp
The
.Ar no
form removes a previously specified option.
.Ss Keywords
The following keywords are recognized in a kernel configuration file:
.Bl -ohang
.It Sy cinclude Xo
.Qq Ar filename
.Xc
Conditionally includes another kernel configuration file whose name is
.Ar filename ,
which may be double-quoted and may be an explicit path or relative to
the kernel source directory.
Failure to open the named file is ignored.
.It Sy config Xo
.Ar exec_name
.No root on
.Ar rootdev
.Op type Ar fstype
.Op dumps on Ar dumpdev
.Xc
Defines a configuration whose kernel executable is named
.Ar exec_name ,
normally
.Dq netbsd ,
with its root file system of type
.Ar fstype
on the device
.Ar rootdev ,
and optionally specifying the location of kernel core dumps on the device
.Ar dumpdev .
.Ar dev
or
.Ar dumpdev
and
.Ar fstype
may be specified as
.Dq \&? ,
which is a wild card.
The root
.Ar fstype
and
.Ar dumpdev
are optional and assumed to be wild carded if they are not specified.
.It Ar device_instance Xo
at
.Ar attachment
.Op Ar locators value Op ...
.Op flags Ar value
.Xc
Define an instance of the device driver
.Ar device_instance
that attaches to the bus or device named
.Ar attachment .
An
.Ar attachment
may require additional information on where the device can be found, such
as an address, channel, function, offset, and/or slot, referred to as
.Ar locators ,
whose
.Ar value
often may be a wild card,
.Dq \&? .
Some device drivers have one or more
.Ar flags
that can be adjusted to affect the way they operate.
.It Sy file-system Xo
.Ar fs_name Op , Ar fs_name Op ...
.Xc
Include support for the file-system
.Ar fs_name .
.It Sy ident Xo
.Qq Ar string
.Xc
Sets the kernel identification string to
.Ar string .
.It Sy include Xo
.Qq Ar filename
.Xc
Functions the same as
.Ar cinclude ,
except failure to open
.Ar filename
produces a fatal error.
.It Sy options Xo
.Ar option_name Op , Ar option_name=value Op ...
.Xc
Specifies (or sets) the option, or comma-separated list of options,
.Ar option_name .
Some options expect to be assigned a value, which may be an integer,
a double-quoted word, a bare word, or an empty string
.Pq Qq .
.Pp
.Em Note :
Options that are not defined by device definition files are passed to
the compile process as
.Fl D
flags to the C compiler.
.It Sy makeoptions Xo
.Ar name=value
.Xc
Defines a
.Xr make 1
macro
.Ar name
with the value
.Ar value
in the kernel Makefile.
.It Sy maxusers Xo
.Ar integer
.Xc
Set the maxusers variable in the kernel.
.It Sy no Xo
.Ar keyword Ar name Op Ar arguments Op ...
.Xc
For the
.Xr config 8
.Ar keywords
file-system, makeoptions, options, and pseudo-device,
.Ar no
removes the file-system, makeoption, options, or pseudo-device,
.Ar name .
This is useful when a kernel configuration file includes another which
has undesired options.
.Pp
For example, a local configuration file that wanted the kitchen sink, but
not COMPAT_09 or bridging, might be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "arch/i386/conf/GENERIC"
no options COMPAT_09
no pseudo-device bridge
.Ed
.It Sy pseudo-device Xo
.Ar name
.Op Ar N
.Xc
Includes support for the pseudo-device
.Ar name .
Some pseudo-devices can have multiple or
.Ar N
instances.
.El
.Ss Compatibility Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options COMPAT_09
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 0.9 .
This enables support for
16-bit user, group, and process IDs (following revisions support
32-bit identifiers),
It also allows the use of the deprecated
.Xr getdomainname 3 ,
.Xr setdomainname 3 ,
and
.Xr uname 3
syscalls.
This option also allows using numeric file system identifiers rather
than strings.
Post
.Nx 0.9
versions use string identifiers.
.It Cd options COMPAT_10
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.0 .
This option allows the use of the file system name of
.Dq ufs
as an alias for
.Dq ffs .
The name
.Dq ffs
should be used post 1.0 in
.Pa /etc/fstab
and other files.
It also adds old syscalls for the
.At V
shared memory interface.
This was changed post 1.0 to work on 64-bit architectures.
This option also enables
.Dq sgtty
compatibility, without which programs using the old interface produce
an
.Dq inappropriate ioctl
error, and
.Pa /dev/io
only works when this option is set in the kernel,
see
.Xr io 4
on ports that support it.
.It Cd options COMPAT_11
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.1 .
This allows binaries running on the i386 port to gain direct access to
the io ports by opening
.Pa /dev/io
read/write.
This functionality was replaced by
.Xr i386_iopl 2
post 1.1.
On the
.Tn Atari
port, the location of the disk label was moved after 1.1.
When the
.Em COMPAT_11
option is set, the kernel will read (pre) 1.1 style disk labels as a
last resort.
When a disklabel is re-written, the old style label will be replaced
with a post 1.1 style label.
This also enables the
.Em EXEC_ELF_NOTELESS
option.
.It Cd options COMPAT_12
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.2 .
This allows the use of old syscalls for
.Fn reboot
and
.Fn swapon .
The syscall numbers were changed post 1.2 to add functionality to the
.Xr reboot 2
syscall, and the new
.Xr swapctl 2
interface was introduced.
This also enables the
.Em EXEC_ELF_NOTELESS
option.
.It Cd options COMPAT_13
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.3 .
This allows the use of old syscalls for
.Fn sigaltstack ,
and also enables the old
.Xr swapctl 2
command
.Dv SWAP_STATS
(now called
.Dv SWAP_OSTATS ) ,
which does not include the
.Fa se_path
member of
.Va struct swapent .
.It Cd options COMPAT_14
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.4 .
This allows some old
.Xr ioctl 2
on
.Xr wscons 4
to be performed, and allows the
.Dv NFSSVC_BIOD
mode of the
.Xr nfssvc 2
system call to be used for compatibility with the deprecated nfsiod program.
.It Cd options COMPAT_16
Enable binary compatibility with
.Nx 1.6 .
This allows the use of old signal trampoline code which has been deprecated
with the addition of
.Xr siginfo 5 .
.It Cd options COMPAT_43
Enables compatibility with
.Bx 4.3 .
This adds an old syscall for
.Xr lseek 2 .
It also adds the ioctls for
.Dv TIOCGETP
and
.Dv TIOCSETP .
The return values for
.Xr getpid 2 ,
.Xr getgid 2 ,
and
.Xr getuid 2
syscalls are modified as well, to return the parent's PID and
UID as well as the current process's.
It also enables the deprecated
.Dv NTTYDISC
terminal line discipline.
It also provides backwards compatibility with
.Dq old
SIOC[GS]IF{ADDR,DSTADDR,BRDADDR,NETMASK} interface ioctls, including
binary compatibility with code written before the introduction of the
sa_len field in sockaddrs.
It also enables
support for some older pre
.Bx 4.4
socket calls.
.It Cd options COMPAT_AOUT
This option is deprecated.
It was used in the
.Xr a.out 5
to
.Xr elf 5
transition phase to enable
.Xr a.out 5
binaries to find their shared libraries.
This has been fixed in
.Xr ld.so 1
in the meantime.
The effect is that for
.Xr a.out 5
binaries, each name lookup will first search in
.Pa /emul/aout .
This causes problems with programs like
.Xr a.out 5
shells and emulations that use
.Xr a.out 5
(like
.Tn BSD/OS ) .
If you use this option you should know what you are doing.
.It Cd options COMPAT_SVR4
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.At V.4
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently includes the i386, m68k, and sparc ports.
.It Cd options COMPAT_LINUX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with Linux ELF and
.Xr a.out 5
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently includes the alpha, arm, i386, m68k, mips, and powerpc
ports.
.It Cd options COMPAT_SUNOS
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn SunOS 4.1
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently includes the sparc, sparc64 and most or all m68k ports.
Note that the sparc64 requires the
.Em COMPAT_NETBSD32
option for 64-bit kernels, in addition to this option.
.It Cd options COMPAT_ULTRIX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn ULTRIX
applications built for the same architecture.
This currently is limited to the pmax.
The functionality of this option is unknown.
.It Cd options COMPAT_DARWIN
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary compatibility with
.Tn Darwin
applications built for the same architecture.
This feature is highly experimental, it requires COMPAT_MACH and
EXEC_MACHO and it is currently limited to i386 and powerpc ports of
.Nx .
.It Cd options COMPAT_FREEBSD
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Fx
applications built for the same architecture.
At the moment this is limited to the i386 port.
.It Cd options COMPAT_HPUX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn HP/UX
applications built for the same architecture.
This is limited to the hp300 port, and has some known bugs.
A limited set of programs do work.
.It Cd options COMPAT_IBCS2
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with iBCS2 or SVR3 applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the i386 and vax ports.
.It Cd options COMPAT_IRIX
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with IRIX o32 binaries built for the same architecture.
This feature is experimental, and it is currently limited to
the sgimips port of
.Nx .
.It Cd options COMPAT_MACH
On those architectures that support it, this enables the emulation of
Mach kernel traps for binaries built for the same architecture.
This features is highly experimental and it is currently
limited to i386 and powerpc ports of
.Nx .
.It Cd options COMPAT_OSF1
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with
.Tn Digital
.Ux
.Po
formerly
.Tn OSF/1
.Pc
applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the alpha port.
.It Cd options COMPAT_NOMID
Enable compatibility with
.Xr a.out 5
executables that lack a machine ID.
This includes
.Nx 0.8 Ns 's
ZMAGIC format, and 386BSD and BSDI's
QMAGIC, NMAGIC, and OMAGIC
.Xr a.out 5
formats.
.It Cd options COMPAT_NETBSD32
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with 32-bit applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the sparc64 port, and only applicable for
64-bit kernels.
.It Cd options COMPAT_SVR4_32
On those architectures that support it, this enables binary
compatibility with 32-bit SVR4 applications built for the same architecture.
This is currently limited to the sparc64 port, and only applicable for
64-bit kernels.
.It Cd options COMPAT_AOUT_M68K
On m68k architectures which have switched to ELF,
this enable binary compatibility with
.Nx Ns Tn /m68k
.Xr a.out 5
executables on
.Nx Ns Tn /m68k
ELF kernel.
This handles alignment incompatibility of m68k ABI between
a.out and ELF which causes the structure padding differences.
Currently only some system calls which use
.Va struct stat
are adjusted and some binaries which use
.Xr sysctl 3
to retrieve network details would not work properly.
.It Cd options EXEC_MACHO
On those architectures that support it, this adds support for running
Mach-O executables.
This is currently limited to the i386 and powerpc ports of
.Nx .
.It Cd options EXEC_ELF_NOTELESS
Run unidentified ELF binaries as
.Nx
binaries.
This might be needed for very old
.Nx
ELF binaries on some archs.
These old binaries didn't contain an appropriate
.Li .note.netbsd.ident
section, and thus can't be identified by the kernel as
.Nx
binaries otherwise.
Beware - if this option is on, the kernel would run
.Em any
unknown ELF binaries as if they were
.It Cd options P1003_1B_SEMAPHORE
Includes kernel support for the standard C library
.Pq Pa libc
functions that implement semaphores as specified in
.St -p1003.1-96 .
.El
.Ss Debugging Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options DDB
Compiles in a kernel debugger for diagnosing kernel problems.
See
.Xr ddb 4
for details.
.Em NOTE :
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options DDB_FROMCONSOLE=integer
If set to non-zero, DDB may be entered by sending a break on a serial
console or by a special key sequence on a graphics console.
A value of "0" ignores console breaks or key sequences.
If not explicitly specified, the default value is "1".
Note that this sets the value of the
.Em ddb.fromconsole
.Xr sysctl 3
variable which may be changed at run time -- see
.Xr sysctl 8
for details.
.It Cd options DDB_HISTORY_SIZE=integer
If this is non-zero, enable history editing in the kernel debugger
and set the size of the history to this value.
.It Cd options DDB_ONPANIC
If set to non-zero, DDB will be entered upon kernel panic.
The default if not specified is "1".
Note that this sets the value of the
.Em ddb.onpanic
.Xr sysctl 3
variable which may be changed at run time -- see
.Xr sysctl 8
for details.
.It Cd options DDB_BREAK_CHAR=integer
This option overrides the using break to enter the kernel debugger
on the serial console.
The value given will is the ascii value to be used instead.
This is currently only supported by the com driver.
.It Cd options KGDB
Compiles in a remote kernel debugger stub for diagnosing kernel problems
using the
.Dq remote target
feature of gdb.
See
.Xr gdb 1
for details.
.Em NOTE :
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEV
Device number
.Po
as a
.Dv dev_t
.Pc
of kgdb device.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEVADDR
Memory address of kgdb device.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEVMODE
Permissions of kgdb device.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEVNAME
Device name of kgdb device.
.It Cd options KGDB_DEVRATE
Baud rate of kgdb device.
.It Cd makeoptions DEBUG="-g"
The -g flag causes
.Pa netbsd.gdb
to be built in addition to
.Pa netbsd .
.Pa netbsd.gdb
is useful for debugging kernel crash dumps with gdb.
See
.Xr gdb 1
for details.
This also turns on
.Em options DEBUG
(which see).
.It Cd options DEBUG
Turns on miscellaneous kernel debugging.
Since options are turned into preprocessor defines (see above),
.Em options DEBUG
is equivalent to doing a
.Em #define DEBUG
throughout the kernel.
Much of the kernel has
.Em #ifdef DEBUG
conditionalized debugging code.
Note that many parts of the kernel (typically device drivers) include their own
.Em #ifdef XXX_DEBUG
conditionals instead.
This option also turns on certain other options,
which may decrease system performance.
.It Cd options DIAGNOSTIC
Adds code to the kernel that does internal consistency checks.
This code will cause the kernel to panic if corruption of internal data
structures is detected.
These checks can decrease performance up to 15%.
.It Cd options KSTACK_CHECK_MAGIC
Check kernel stack usage and panic if stack overflow is detected.
This check is performance sensitive because it scans stack on each context
switch.
.It Cd options KTRACE
Add hooks for the system call tracing facility, which allows users to
watch the system call invocation behavior of processes.
See
.Xr ktrace 1
for details.
.It Cd options MSGBUFSIZE=integer
This option sets the size of the kernel message buffer.
This buffer holds the kernel output of
.Fn printf
when not (yet) read by
.Xr syslogd 8 .
This is particularly useful when the system has crashed and you wish to lookup
the kernel output from just before the crash.
Also, since the autoconfig output becomes more and more verbose,
it sometimes happens that the message buffer overflows before
.Xr syslogd 8
was able to read it.
Note that not all systems are capable of obtaining a variable sized message
buffer.
There are also some systems on which memory contents are not preserved
across reboots.
.It Cd options MALLOCLOG
Enables an event log for
.Xr malloc 9 .
Useful for tracking down
.Dq Data modified on freelist
and
.Dq multiple free
problems.
.It Cd options MALLOCLOGSIZE=integer
Defines the number of entries in the malloc log.
Default is 100000 entries.
.It Cd options SYSTRACE
Add hooks for the system call policy facility.
See
.Xr systrace 1
for details.
.It Cd options UVMHIST
Enables the UVM history logs, which create in-memory traces of
various UVM activities.
These logs can be displayed be calling
.Fn uvmhist_dump
or
.Fn uvm_hist
with appropriate arguments from DDB.
See the kernel source file sys/uvm/uvm_stat.c for details.
.It Cd options UVMHIST_PRINT
Prints the UVM history logs on the system console as entries are added.
Note that the output is
.Em extremely
voluminous, so this option is really only useful for debugging
the very earliest parts of kernel initialization.
.El
.Ss File Systems
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd file-system FFS
Includes code implementing the Berkeley Fast File System
.Em ( FFS ) .
Most machines need this if they are not running diskless.
.It Cd file-system EXT2FS
Includes code implementing the Second Extended File System
.Em ( EXT2FS ) ,
revision 0 and revision 1 with the
.Em filetype
and
.Em sparse_super
options.
This is the most commonly used file system on the Linux operating system,
and is provided here for compatibility.
Some of the specific features of
.Em EXT2FS
like the "behavior on errors" are not implemented.
This file system can't be used with UID or GID greater than 65535.
See
.Xr mount_ext2fs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system LFS
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Include the Log-structured File System
.Em ( LFS ) .
See
.Xr mount_lfs 8
and
.Xr newfs_lfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system MFS
Include the Memory File System
.Em ( MFS ) .
This file system stores files in swappable memory, and produces
notable performance improvements when it is used as the file store
for
.Pa /tmp
and similar file systems.
See
.Xr mount_mfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system NFS
Include the client side of the Network File System
.Pq Tn NFS
remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Tn NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to work.
See
.Xr mount_nfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system CD9660
Includes code for the
.Tn ISO
9660 + Rock Ridge file system, which is the standard file system on many
.Tn CD-ROM
discs.
Useful primarily if you have a
.Tn CD-ROM
drive.
See
.Xr mount_cd9660 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system MSDOSFS
Includes the
.Tn MS-DOS
FAT file system, which is reportedly still used
by unfortunate people who have not heard about
.Nx .
Also implements the
.Tn Windows 95
extensions to the same, which permit the use of longer, mixed case
file names.
See
.Xr mount_msdos 8
and
.Xr fsck_msdos 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system NTFS
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes code for the
.Tn Microsoft Windows NT
file system.
See
.Xr mount_ntfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system FDESC
Includes code for a file system, conventionally mounted on
.Pa /dev/fd ,
which permits access to the per-process file descriptor space via
special files in the file system.
See
.Xr mount_fdesc 8
for details.
Note that this facility is redundant, and thus unneeded on most
.Nx
systems, since the
.Xr fd 4
pseudo-device driver already provides identical functionality.
On most
.Nx
systems, instances of
.Xr fd 4
are mknoded under
.Pa /dev/fd/
and on
.Pa /dev/stdin ,
.Pa /dev/stdout ,
and
.Pa /dev/stderr .
.It Cd file-system KERNFS
Includes code which permits the mounting of a special file system
(normally mounted on
.Pa /kern )
in which files representing various kernel variables and parameters
may be found.
See
.Xr mount_kernfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system NULLFS
Includes code for a loopback file system.
This permits portions of the file hierarchy to be re-mounted in other places.
The code really exists to provide an example of a stackable file system layer.
See
.Xr mount_null 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system OVERLAY
Includes code for a file system filter.
This permits the overlay file system to intercept all access to an underlying
file system.
This file system is intended to serve as an example of a stacking file
system which has a need to interpose itself between an underlying file
system and all other access.
See
.Xr mount_overlay 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system PORTAL
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes the portal file system.
This permits interesting tricks like opening
.Tn TCP
sockets by opening files in the file system.
The portal file system is conventionally mounted on
.Pa /p
and is partially implemented by a special daemon.
See
.Xr mount_portal 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system PROCFS
Includes code for a special file system (conventionally mounted on
.Pa /proc )
in which the process space becomes visible in the file system.
Among
other things, the memory spaces of processes running on the system are
visible as files, and signals may be sent to processes by writing to
.Pa ctl
files in the procfs namespace.
See
.Xr mount_procfs 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system UMAPFS
Includes a loopback file system in which user and group IDs may be
remapped -- this can be useful when mounting alien file systems with
different UIDs and GIDs than the local system.
See
.Xr mount_umap 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system UNION
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes code for the union file system, which permits directories to
be mounted on top of each other in such a way that both file systems
remain visible -- this permits tricks like allowing writing (and the
deleting of files) on a read-only file system like a
.Tn CD-ROM
by mounting a local writable file system on top of the read-only file system.
See
.Xr mount_union 8
for details.
.It Cd file-system CODA
.Em [EXPERIMENTAL]
Includes code for the Coda file system.
Coda is a distributed file system like NFS and AFS.
It is freely available, like NFS, but it functions much like AFS in being a
.Dq stateful
file system.
Both Coda and AFS cache files on your local machine to improve performance.
Then Coda goes a step further than AFS by letting you access the cached
files when there is no available network, viz. disconnected laptops and
network outages.
In Coda, both the client and server are outside the kernel which makes
them easier to experiment with.
Coda is available for several UNIX and non-UNIX platforms.
See http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu for more details.
NOTE: You also need to enable the pseudo-device, vcoda, for the Coda
file system to work.
.El
.Ss File System Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options NFSSERVER
Include the server side of the
.Em NFS
(Network File System) remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Em NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to
work.
See
.Xr mountd 8
and
.Xr nfsd 8
for details.
.It Cd options QUOTA
Enables kernel support for file system quotas.
See
.Xr quotaon 8 ,
.Xr edquota 8 ,
and
.Xr quota 1
for details.
Note that quotas only work on
.Dq ffs
file systems, although
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
permits them to be accessed over
.Em NFS .
.It Cd options FFS_EI
Enable ``Endian-Independent'' FFS support.
This allows a system to mount an FFS file system created for another
architecture, at a small performance cost for all FFS file systems.
See also
.Xr newfs 8 ,
.Xr fsck_ffs 8 ,
.Xr dumpfs 8
for file system byte order status and manipulation.
.It Cd options NVNODE=integer
This option sets the size of the cache used by the name-to-inode translation
routines, (a.k.a. the
.Fn namei
cache, though called by many other names in the kernel source).
By default, this cache has
.Dv NPROC
(set as 20 + 16 * MAXUSERS) * (80 + NPROC / 8) entries.
A reasonable way to derive a value of
.Dv NVNODE ,
should you notice a large number of namei cache misses with a tool such as
.Xr systat 1 ,
is to examine your system's current computed value with
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
(which calls this parameter "kern.maxvnodes") and to increase this value
until either the namei cache hit rate improves or it is determined that
your system does not benefit substantially from an increase in the size of
the namei cache.
.It Cd options NAMECACHE_ENTER_REVERSE
Causes the namei cache to always enter a reverse mapping (vnode -\*[Gt] name)
as well as a normal one.
Normally, this is already done for directory vnodes, to speed up the getcwd
operation.
This option will cause longer hash chains in the reverse cache, and thus
slow down getcwd somewhat.
However, it does make vnode -\*[Gt] path translations possible in some cases.
For now, only useful if strict /proc/#/maps emulation for Linux binaries is
required.
.It Cd options EXT2FS_SYSTEM_FLAGS
This option changes the behavior of the APPEND and IMMUTABLE flags
for a file on an
.Em EXT2FS
file system.
Without this option, the superuser or owner of the file can
set and clear them.
With this option, only the superuser can set them, and
they can't be cleared if the securelevel is greater than 0.

.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_BOOTP
Enable use of the BOOTP protocol (RFCs 951 and 1048) to get configuration
information if NFS is used to mount the root file system.

.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_DHCP
Same as
.Dq NFS_BOOT_BOOTP ,
but use the DHCP extensions to the
BOOTP protocol (RFC 1541).
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_BOOTP_REQFILE
Specifies the string sent in the bp_file field of the BOOTP / DHCP
request packet.
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_BOOTPARAM
Enable use of the BOOTPARAM protocol, consisting of RARP and
BOOTPARAM RPC, to get configuration information if NFS
is used to mount the root file system.
See
.Xr diskless 8
for details.
.It Cd options NFS_BOOT_RWSIZE=value
Set the initial NFS read and write sizes for diskless-boot requests.
The normal default is 8Kbytes.
This option provides a way to lower the value (e.g., to 1024 bytes)
as a workaround for buggy network interface cards or boot PROMs.
Once booted, the read and write request sizes can be increased by
remounting the file system.
See
.Xr mount_nfs 8

.El
.Ss Miscellaneous Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options NEW_BUFQ_STRATEGY
Enable experimental buffer queue strategy for disk I/O.
It gives higher priority to read requests over write requests, and thereby
improves the overall system responsiveness considerably under heavy disk
I/O load.
.Em NOTE :
It's not yet proven to be stable, so use it at your own risk.
.It Cd options LKM
Enable loadable kernel modules.
See
.Xr lkm 4
for details.
.Em NOTE :
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options INSECURE
Hardwires the kernel security level at -1.
This means that the system
always runs in secure level 0 mode, even when running multiuser.
See the manual page for
.Xr init 8
for details on the implications of this.
The kernel secure level may manipulated by the superuser by altering the
.Em kern.securelevel
.Xr sysctl 3
variable (the secure level may only be lowered by a call from process ID 1,
i.e.
.Xr init 8 ) .
See also
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3 .
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_DYNAMIC
This options makes the
.Xr md 4
.Tn RAM
disk size dynamically sized.
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_HOOKS
This option allows for some machine dependent functions to be called when
the
.Xr md 4
.Tn RAM
disk driver is configured.
This can result in automatically loading a
.Tn RAM
disk from floppy on open (among other things).
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_IS_ROOT
Forces the
.Xr md 4
.Tn RAM
disk to be the root device.
This can only be overridden when
the kernel is booted in the 'ask-for-root' mode.
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_ROOT_SIZE=integer
Allocates the given number of 512 byte blocks as memory for the
.Xr md 4
.Tn RAM
disk, to be populated with
.Xr mdsetimage 8 .
.It Cd options MEMORY_DISK_SERVER=0
Do not include the interface to a userland memory disk server process.
Per default, this options is set to 1, including the support code.
Useful for install media kernels.
.It Cd options VNODE_OP_NOINLINE
Do not inline the
.Fn VOP_*
calls in the kernel.
On i386 GENERIC, this saves 36k of kernel text.
Useful for install media kernels, small memory systems and embedded systems.
.It Cd options MALLOC_NOINLINE
Time critical fixed size memory allocation is performed with
.Fn MALLOC
and
.Fn FREE .
Normally these expand to inline code, but with
.Em MALLOC_NOINLINE
these call the normal
.Fn malloc
and
.Fn free
functions.
Useful for install media kernels, small memory systems and embedded systems.
.It Cd options HZ=integer
On ports that support it, set the system clock frequency (see
.Xr hz 9 )
to the supplied value.
Handle with care.
.It Cd options NTP
Turns on in-kernel precision timekeeping support used by software
implementing
.Em NTP
(Network Time Protocol, RFC 1305).
The
.Em NTP
option adds an in-kernel Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for normal
.Em NTP
operation, and a Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) for intermittently-connected
operation.
.Xr ntpd 8
will employ a user-level PLL when kernel support is unavailable,
but the in-kernel version has lower latency and more precision, and
so typically keeps much better time.
The interface to the kernel
.Em NTP
support is provided by the
.Xr ntp_adjtime 2
and
.Xr ntp_gettime 2
system calls, which are intended for use by
.Xr ntpd 8
and are enabled by the option.
On systems with sub-microsecond resolution timers, or where (HZ / 100000)
is not an integer, the
.Em NTP
option also enables extended-precision arithmetic to keep track of
fractional clock ticks at NTP time-format precision.
.It Cd options PPS_SYNC
This option enables a kernel serial line discipline for receiving time
phase signals from an external reference clock such as a radio clock.
(The
.Em NTP
option (which see) must be on if the
.Em PPS_SYNC
option is used.)
Some reference clocks generate a Pulse Per Second (PPS) signal in
phase with their time source.
The
.Em PPS
line discipline receives this signal on either the data leads
or the DCD control lead of a serial port.
.Em NTP
uses the PPS signal to discipline the local clock oscillator to a high
degree of precision (typically less than 50 microseconds in time and
0.1 ppm in accuracy).
.Em PPS
can also generate a serial output pulse when the system receives a PPS
interrupt.
This can be used to measure the system interrupt latency and thus calibrate
.Em NTP
to account for it.
Using
.Em PPS
usually requires a
gadget box
to convert from TTL to RS-232 signal levels.
The gadget box and PPS are described in more detail in the HTML documentation
for
.Xr ntpd 8
in
.Pa /usr/share/doc/html/ntp .
.It Cd options NO_TSC_TIME
Don't use TSC microtime, even if available (i386 only).
Improves time behavior under VMware.
.It Cd options SETUIDSCRIPTS
Allows scripts with the setuid bit set to execute as the effective
user rather than the real user, just like binary executables.
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Using this option will also enable
.Em options FDSCRIPTS
.It Cd options FDSCRIPTS
Allows execution of scripts with the execute bit set, but not the
read bit, by opening the file and passing the file descriptor to
the shell, rather than the filename.
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Execute only (non-readable) scripts will have
.Va argv[0]
set to
.Pa /dev/fd/* .
What this option allows as far as security is
concerned, is the ability to safely ensure that the correct script
is run by the interpreter, as it is passed as an already open file.
.It Cd options PUCCN
Enables treating serial ports found on PCI boards
.Xr puc 4
as potential console devices.
The method for choosing such a console device is port dependent.
.It Cd options RTC_OFFSET=integer
The kernel (and typically the hardware battery backed-up clock on
those machines that have one) keeps time in
.Em UTC
(Universal Coordinated Time, once known as
.Em GMT ,
or Greenwich Mean Time)
and not in the time of the local time zone.
The
.Em RTC_OFFSET
option is used on some ports (such as the i386) to tell the kernel
that the hardware clock is offset from
.Em UTC
by the specified number of minutes.
This is typically used when a machine boots several operating
systems and one of them wants the hardware clock to run in the
local time zone and not in
.Em UTC ,
e.g.
.Em RTC_OFFSET=300
means
the hardware clock is set to US Eastern Time (300 minutes behind
.Em UTC ) ,
and not
.Em UTC .
(Note:
.Em RTC_OFFSET
is used to initialize a kernel variable named
.Va rtc_offset
which is the source actually used to determine the clock offset, and
which may be accessed via the kern.rtc_offset sysctl variable.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
Since the kernel clock is initialized from the hardware clock very
early in the boot process, it is not possible to meaningfully change
.Va rtc_offset
in system initialization scripts.
Changing this value currently may only be done at kernel compile
time or by patching the kernel and rebooting).
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Unfortunately, in many cases where the hardware clock
is kept in local time, it is adjusted for Daylight Savings
Time; this means that attempting to use
.Em RTC_OFFSET
to let
.Nx
coexist with such an operating system, like Windows,
would necessitate changing
.Em RTC_OFFSET
twice a year.
As such, this solution is imperfect.
.It Cd options KMEMSTATS
The kernel memory allocator,
.Xr malloc 9 ,
will keep statistics on its performance if this option is enabled.
Unfortunately, this option therefore essentially disables the
.Fn MALLOC
and
.Fn FREE
forms of the memory allocator, which are used to enhance the performance
of certain critical sections of code in the kernel.
This option therefore can lead to a significant decrease in the
performance of certain code in the kernel if enabled.
Examples of such code include the
.Fn namei
routine, the
.Xr ccd 4
driver,
and much of the networking code.
.It Cd options MAXUPRC=integer
Sets the soft
.Dv RLIMIT_NPROC
resource limit, which specifies the maximum number of simultaneous
processes a user is permitted to run, for process 0;
this value is inherited by its child processes.
It defaults to
.Em CHILD_MAX ,
which is currently defined to be 160.
Setting
.Em MAXUPRC
to a value less than
.Em CHILD_MAX
is not permitted, as this would result in a violation of the semantics of
.St -p1003.1-90 .
.It Cd options NOFILE=integer
Sets the soft
.Dv RLIMIT_NOFILE
resource limit, which specifies the maximum number of open
file descriptors for each process;
this value is inherited by its child processes.
It defaults to
.Em OPEN_MAX ,
which is currently defined to be 64.
.It Cd options DEFCORENAME=string
Sets the default value of the
.Em kern.defcorename
sysctl variable, otherwise it is set to
.Nm %n.core .
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd options RASOPS_CLIPPING
Enables clipping within the
.Nm rasops
raster-console output system.
.Em NOTE :
only available on architectures that use
.Nm rasops
for console output.
.It Cd options RASOPS_SMALL
Removes optimized character writing code from the
.Nm rasops
raster-console output system.
.Em NOTE :
only available on architectures that use
.Nm rasops
for console output.
.It Cd options INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE
Embeds the kernel config file used to define the kernel in the kernel
binary itself.
The embedded data also includes any files directly included by the config
file itself, e.g.
.Pa GENERIC.local
or
.Pa std.$MACHINE .
The embedded config file can be extracted from the resulting kernel with
.Xr config 8
.Ar -x ,
or by the following command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
strings netbsd | sed -n 's/^_CFG_//p' | unvis
.Ed
.It Cd options INCLUDE_JUST_CONFIG
Similar to the above option, but includes just the actual config file,
not any included files.
.It Cd options PIPE_SOCKETPAIR
Use slower, but smaller socketpair(2)-based pipe implementation instead
of default faster, but bigger one.
Primarily useful for installation kernels.
.It Cd options USERCONF
Compiles in the in-kernel device configuration manager.
See
.Xr userconf 4
for details.
.It Cd options PERFCTRS
Compiles in kernel support for CPU performance-monitoring counters.
See
.Xr pmc 1
for details.
.Em NOTE :
not available on all architectures.
.It Cd options XSERVER
Compiles in kernel support for
.Tn X11
on architectures that still use (or can use) the legacy
.Em pccons
console drivers rather than
.Xr wscons 4 .
These include bebox, i386, shark.

.It Cd options GATEWAY
Enables
.Em IPFORWARDING
(which see)
and (on most ports) increases the size of
.Em NMBCLUSTERS
(which see).
In general,
.Em GATEWAY
is used to indicate that a system should act as a router, and
.Em IPFORWARDING
is not invoked directly.
(Note that
.Em GATEWAY
has no impact on protocols other than
.Tn IP ,
such as
.Tn CLNP
or
.Tn XNS ) .
.Em GATEWAY
option also compiles IPv4 fast forwarding code into the kernel.
.It Cd options IPFORWARDING=value
If
.Em value
is 1 this enables IP routing behavior.
If
.Em value
is 0 (the default), it disables it.
The
.Em GATEWAY
option sets this to 1 automatically.
With this option enabled, the machine will forward IP datagrams destined
for other machines between its interfaces.
Note that even without this option, the kernel will
still forward some packets (such as source routed packets) -- removing
.Em GATEWAY
and
.Em IPFORWARDING
is insufficient to stop all routing through a bastion host on a
firewall -- source routing is controlled independently.
To turn off source routing, use
.Em options IPFORWSRCRT=0
(which see).
Note that IP forwarding may be turned on and off independently of the
setting of the
.Em IPFORWARDING
option through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.inet.ip.forwarding
is 1, IP forwarding is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd options IPFORWSRCRT=value
If
.Em value
is set to zero, source routing of IP datagrams is turned off.
If
.Em value
is set to one (the default) or the option is absent, source routed IP
datagrams are forwarded by the machine.
Note that source routing of IP packets may be turned on and off
independently of the setting of the
.Em IPFORWSRCRT
option through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.forwsrcrt
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.inet.ip.forwsrcrt
is 1, forwarding of source routed IP datagrams is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd options IFA_STATS
Tells the kernel to maintain per-address statistics on bytes sent
and received over (currently) internet and appletalk addresses.
.\"This can be a fairly expensive operation, so you probably want to
.\"keep this disabled.
The option is not recommended as it degrades system stability.
.It Cd options IFQ_MAXLEN=value
Increases the allowed size of the network interface packet queues.
The default queue size is 50 packets, and you do not normally need
to increase it.
.It Cd options MROUTING
Includes support for IP multicast routers.
You certainly want
.Em INET
with this.
Multicast routing is controlled by the

.It Cd options ALTQ
Enabled ALTQ (Alternate Queueing).
For simple rate-limiting, use
.Xr tbrconfig 8
to set up the interface transmission rate.
To use queueing disciplines, their appropriate kernel options should also
be defined (documented below).
Queueing disciplines are managed by
.Xr altqd 8 .
See
.Xr altq 9
for details.
.It Cd options ALTQ_HFSC
Include support for ALTQ-implemented HFSC (Hierarchical Fair Service Curve)
module.
HFSC supports both link-sharing and guaranteed real-time services.
H-FSC employs a service curve based QoS model, and its unique feature
is an ability to decouple delay and bandwidth allocation.
Requires
.Em ALTQ_RED
to use the RED queueing discipline on HFSC classes, or
.Em ALTQ_RIO
to use the RIO queueing discipline on HFSC classes.
This option assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_PRIQ
Include support for ALTQ-implemented PRIQ (Priority Queueing).
PRIQ implements a simple priority-based queueing discipline.
A higher priority class is always served first.
Requires
.Em ALTQ_RED
to use the RED queueing discipline on HFSC classes, or
.Em ALTQ_RIO
to use the RIO queueing discipline on HFSC classes.
This option assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_WFQ
Include support for ALTQ-implemented WFQ (Weighted Fair Queueing).
WFQ implements a weighted-round robin scheduler for a set of queues.
A weight can be assigned to each queue to give a different proportion
of the link capacity.
A hash function is used to map a flow to one of a set of queues.
This option assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_FIFOQ
Include support for ALTQ-implemented FIFO queueing.
FIFOQ is a simple drop-tail FIFO (First In, First Out) queueing discipline.
This option assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_RIO
Include support for ALTQ-implemented RIO (RED with In/Out).
The original RIO has 2 sets of RED parameters; one for in-profile
packets and the other for out-of-profile packets.
At the ingress of the network, profile meters tag packets as IN or
OUT based on contracted profiles for customers.
Inside the network, IN packets receive preferential treatment by
the RIO dropper.
ALTQ/RIO has 3 drop precedence levels defined for the Assured Forwarding
PHB of DiffServ (RFC 2597).
This option assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_BLUE
Include support for ALTQ-implemented Blue buffer management.
Blue is another active buffer management mechanism.
This option assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_FLOWVALVE
Include support for ALTQ-implemented Flowvalve.
Flowvalve is a simple implementation of a RED penalty box that identifies
and punishes misbehaving flows.
This option requires
.Em ALTQ_RED
and assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_CDNR
Include support for ALTQ-implemented CDNR (diffserv traffic conditioner)
packet marking/manipulation.
Traffic conditioners are components to meter, mark, or drop incoming
packets according to some rules.
As opposed to queueing disciplines, traffic conditioners handle incoming
packets at an input interface.
This option assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_NOPCC
Disables use of processor cycle counter to measure time in ALTQ.
This option should be defined for a non-Pentium i386 CPU which does not
have TSC, SMP (per-CPU counters are not in sync), or power management
which affects processor cycle counter.
This option assumes

.It Cd options ALTQ_AFMAP
Include support for an undocumented ALTQ feature that is used to map an IP
flow to an ATM VC (Virtual Circuit).
This option assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options ALTQ_LOCALQ
Include support for ALTQ-implemented local queues.
Its practical use is undefined.
Assumes
.Em ALTQ .
.It Cd options SUBNETSARELOCAL
Sets default value for net.inet.ip.subnetsarelocal variable, which
controls whether non-directly-connected subnets of connected networks
are considered "local" for purposes of choosing the MSS for a TCP
connection.
This is mostly present for historic reasons and completely irrelevant if
you enable Path MTU discovery.
.It Cd options HOSTZEROBROADCAST
Sets default value for net.inet.ip.hostzerobroadcast variable, which
controls whether the zeroth host address of each connected subnet is
also considered a broadcast address.
Default value is "1", for compatibility with old systems; if this is
set to zero on all hosts on a subnet, you should be able to fit an extra
host per subnet on the
".0" address.
.It Cd options MCLSHIFT=value
This option is the base-2 logarithm of the size of mbuf clusters.
The
.Bx
networking stack keeps network packets in a linked
list, or chain, of kernel buffer objects called mbufs.
The system provides larger mbuf clusters as an optimization for
large packets, instead of using long chains for large packets.
The mbuf cluster size,
or
.Em MCLBYTES ,
must be a power of two, and is computed as two raised to the power
.Em MCLSHIFT .
On systems with Ethernet network adaptors,
.Em MCLSHIFT
is often set to 11, giving 2048-byte mbuf clusters, large enough to
hold a 1500-byte
.Tn Ethernet
frame in a single cluster.
Systems with network interfaces supporting larger frame sizes like
.Tn ATM ,
.Tn FDDI ,
or
.Tn HIPPI
may perform better with
.Em MCLSHIFT
set to 12 or 13, giving mbuf cluster sizes of 4096 and 8192 bytes,
respectively.

.Tn X.25
protocol stack.
The state of this code is currently unknown, and probably contains bugs.
This option assumes
.Em INET .
.It Cd options NETATALK
Include support for the
.Tn AppleTalk
protocol stack.
The kernel provides provision for the
.Em Datagram Delivery Protocol
(DDP), providing SOCK_DGRAM support and
.Tn AppleTalk
routing.
This stack is used by the
.Em NETATALK
package, which adds support for
.Tn AppleTalk
server services via user libraries and applications.
.It Cd options IPNOPRIVPORTS
Normally, only root can bind a socket descriptor to a so-called
.Dq privileged
.Tn TCP
port, that is, a port number in the range 0-1023.
This option eliminates those checks from the kernel.
This can be useful if there is a desire to allow daemons without
privileges to bind those ports, e.g., on firewalls.
The security tradeoffs in doing this are subtle.
This option should only be used by experts.
.It Cd options TCP_COMPAT_42
.Tn TCP
bug compatibility with
.Bx 4.2 .
In
.Bx 4.2 ,
.Tn TCP
sequence numbers were 32-bit signed values.
Modern implementations of TCP use unsigned values.
This option clamps the initial sequence number to start in
the range 2^31 rather than the full unsigned range of 2^32.
Also, under
.Bx 4.2 ,
keepalive packets must contain at least one byte or else
the remote end would not respond.
.It Cd options TCP_DEBUG
Record the last
.Em TCP_NDEBUG
TCP packets with SO_DEBUG set, and decode to the console if
.Em tcpconsdebug
is set.
.It Cd options TCP_NDEBUG
Number of packets to record for
.Em TCP_DEBUG .
Defaults to 100.
.It Cd options TCP_SENDSPACE=value
.It Cd options TCP_RECVSPACE=value
These options set the max TCP window size to other sizes than the default.
The TCP window sizes can be altered via
.Xr sysctl 8
as well.
.It Cd options TCP_INIT_WIN=value
This option sets the initial TCP window size for non-local connections,
which is used when the transmission starts.
The default size is 1, but if the machine should act more aggressively,
the initial size can be set to some other value.
The initial TCP window size can be set via
.Xr sysctl 8
as well.
.It Cd options PFIL_HOOKS
This option turns on the packet filter interface hooks.
See
.Xr pfil 9
for details.
This option assumes
.Em INET .
.It Cd options IPFILTER_LOG
This option, in conjunction with
.Em pseudo-device ipfilter ,
enables logging of IP packets using ip-filter.
.It Cd options IPFILTER_DEFAULT_BLOCK
This option sets the default policy of ip-filter.
If it is set, ip-filter will block packets by default.
.It Cd options BRIDGE_IPF
This option causes
.Em bridge
devices to use the IP and/or IPv6 filtering hooks, forming
a link-layer filter that uses protocol-layer rules.
This option assumes the presence of
.Em pseudo-device ipfilter .
.It Cd options MBUFTRACE
This option can help track down mbuf leaks.
When enabled, mbufs are tagged with the devices and protocols using them,
which slightly decreases network performance.
This additional information can be viewed with

.El
.Ss VM Related Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options NMBCLUSTERS=value
The number of mbuf clusters the kernel supports.
Mbuf clusters are MCLBYTES in size (usually 2k).
This is used to compute the size of the kernel VM map
.Em mb_map ,
which maps mbuf clusters.
Default on most ports is 1024 (2048 with
.Dq options GATEWAY
).
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/param.h
for exact default information.
Increase this value if you get
.Dq mclpool limit reached
messages.
.It Cd options NKMEMPAGES=value
.It Cd options NKMEMPAGES_MIN=value
.It Cd options NKMEMPAGES_MAX=value
Size of kernel VM map
.Em kmem_map ,
in PAGE_SIZE-sized chunks (the VM page size; this value may be read
from the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Em hw.pagesize
).
This VM map is used to map the kernel malloc arena.
The kernel attempts to auto-size this map based on the amount of
physical memory in the system.
Platform-specific code may place bounds on this computed size,
which may be viewed with the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Em vm.nkmempages .
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/param.h
for the default upper and lower bounds.
The related options
.Sq NKMEMPAGES_MIN
and
.Sq NKMEMPAGES_MAX
allow the bounds to be overridden in the kernel configuration file.
These options are provided in the event the computed value is
insufficient resulting in an
.Dq out of space in kmem_map
panic.
.It Cd options SB_MAX=value
Sets the max size in bytes that a socket buffer is allowed to occupy.
The default is 256k, but sometimes it needs to be increased, for example
when using large TCP windows.
This option can be changed via
.Xr sysctl 8
as well.
.It Cd options SOMAXKVA=value
Sets the maximum size of kernel virtual memory that the socket buffers
are allowed to use.
The default is 16MB, but in situations where for example large TCP
windows are used this value must also be increased.
This option can be changed via
.Xr sysctl 8
as well.
.It Cd options BUFCACHE=value
Size of the buffer cache as a percentage of total available
.Tn RAM .
Ignored if BUFPAGES is also specified.
.It Cd options NBUF=value
Sets the number of buffer headers available, i.e., the number of
open files that may have a buffer cache entry.
Each buffer header
requires MAXBSIZE (machine dependent, but usually 65536) bytes.
The default value is machine dependent, but is usually equal to the
value of BUFPAGES.
If an architecture dependent VM_MAX_KERNEL_BUF constant is defined
then NBUF may be reduced at run time so that the storage allocated
for buffer headers doesn't exceed that limit.
.It Cd options BUFPAGES=value
These options set the number of pages available for the buffer cache.
Their default value is a machine dependent value, often calculated as
between 5% and 10% of total available
.Tn RAM .
.It Cd options MAXTSIZ=bytes
Sets the maximum size limit of a process' text segment.
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/vmparam.h
for the port-specific default.
.It Cd options DFLDSIZ=bytes
Sets the default size limit of a process' data segment, the value that
will be returned as the soft limit for
.Dv RLIMIT_DATA
(as returned by
.Xr getrlimit 2 ) .
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/vmparam.h
for the port-specific default.
.It Cd options MAXDSIZ=bytes
Sets the maximum size limit of a process' data segment, the value that
will be returned as the hard limit for
.Dv RLIMIT_DATA
(as returned by
.Xr getrlimit 2 ) .
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/vmparam.h
for the port-specific default.
.It Cd options DFLSSIZ=bytes
Sets the default size limit of a process' stack segment, the value that
will be returned as the soft limit for
.Dv RLIMIT_STACK
(as returned by
.Xr getrlimit 2 ) .
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/vmparam.h
for the port-specific default.
.It Cd options MAXSSIZ=bytes
Sets the maximum size limit of a process' stack segment, the value that
will be returned as the hard limit for
.Dv RLIMIT_STACK
(as returned by
.Xr getrlimit 2 ) .
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/vmparam.h
for the port-specific default.
.It Cd options DUMP_ON_PANIC=integer
Defaults to one.
If set to zero, the kernel will not dump to the dump device when
it panics, though dumps can still be forced via
.Xr ddb 4
with the
.Dq sync
command.
Note that this sets the value of the
.Em kern.dump_on_panic
.Xr sysctl 3
variable which may be changed at run time -- see
.Xr sysctl 8
for details.
.It Cd options USE_TOPDOWN_VM
User space memory allocations (as made by
.Xr mmap 2 )
will be arranged in a
.Dq top down
fashion instead of the traditional
.Dq upwards from MAXDSIZ \+ vm_daddr
method.
This includes the placement of
.Xr ld.so 1 .
Arranging memory in this manner allows either (or both of) the heap or
.Xr mmap 2
allocated space to grow larger than traditionally possible.
This option is not available on all ports, but is instead expected to be
offered on a port-by-port basis, after which some ports will commit to
using it by default.
See the files
.Pa /usr/include/uvm/uvm_param.h
for some implementation details, and
.Pa /usr/include/machine/vmparam.h
for port specific details including availability.

.Ss amiga-specific Options
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options BB060STUPIDROM
When the bootloader (which passes
.Tn AmigaOS
.Tn ROM
information) claims we have a 68060
.Tn CPU
without
.Tn FPU ,
go look into the Processor Configuration Register (PCR) to find out.
You need this with
.Tn Amiga
.Tn ROM Ns s
up to (at least) V40.xxx (OS3.1),
when you boot via the bootblocks and don't have a DraCo.
.It Cd options IOBZCLOCK=frequency
The IOBlix boards come with two different serial master clocks: older ones
use 24 MHz, newer ones use 22.1184 MHz.
The driver normally assumes the latter.
If your board uses 24 MHz, you can recompile your kernel with
options IOBZCLOCK=24000000
or patch the kernel variable
.Tn iobzclock
to the same value.
.It Cd options LIMITMEM=value
If there, limit the part of the first memory bank used by
.Nx
to value megabytes.
Default is unlimited.
.It Cd options NKPTADD=addvalue
.It Cd options NKPTADDSHIFT=shiftvalue
The
.Tn CPU
specific
.Tn MMU
table for the kernel is pre-allocated at kernel startup time.
Part of it is scaled with
.Va maxproc ,
to have enough room to hold the user program
.Tn MMU
tables; the second part is a fixed amount for the kernel itself.
.Pp
The third part accounts for the size of the file buffer cache.
Its size is either
.Dv NKPTADD
pages (if defined) or memory size in bytes divided by two to
the power of
.Dv NKPTADDSHIFT .
The default is undefined
.Dv NKPTADD
and
.Dv NKPTADDSHIFT=24 ,
allowing for 16 buffers per megabyte of main memory (while
a GENERIC kernel allocates about half of that).
When you get "can't get KPT page" panics, you should increase
.Dv NKPTADD
(if defined), or decrease
.Dv NKPTADDSHIFT
by one.
.It Cd options P5PPC68KBOARD
Add special support for Phase5 mixed 68k+PPC boards.
Currently, this only affects rebooting from
.Nx
and is only needed on 68040+PPC, not on
68060+PPC; without this, affected machines will hang after
.Nx
has shut
down and will only restart after a keyboard reset or a power cycle.

.It Cd options FALCON_SCSI
Include support for the 5380-SCSI configuration as found on the Falcon.
.It Cd options RELOC_KERNEL
If set, the kernel will relocate itself to TT-RAM, if possible.
This will give you a slightly faster system.
.Em Beware
that on some TT030 systems,
the system will frequently dump with MMU-faults with this option enabled.
.It Cd options SERCONSOLE
Allow the modem1-port to act as the system-console.
A carrier should be active on modem1 during system boot to active
the console functionality.

.Po
.Tn i386 ,
.Tn i486 ,
.Tn Pentium ,
or
.Tn Pentium Pro
.Pc .
If the appropriate class for your
.Tn CPU
is not configured, the kernel will use the highest class available
that will work.
In general, using the correct
.Tn CPU
class will result in the best performance.
At least one of these options must be present.
.It Cd options CPURESET_DELAY=value
specifies the time (in millisecond) to wait before doing a hardware reset
in the last phase of a reboot.
This gives the user a chance to see error messages from the shutdown
operations (like NFS unmounts, buffer cache flush, etc ...).
Setting this to 0 will disable the delay.
Default is 2 seconds.
.It Cd options MATH_EMULATE
Include the floating point emulator.
This is useful only for

emulators and X servers to run BIOS code, e.g., for some VESA routines.
.It Cd options USER_LDT
Include i386-specific system calls for modifying the local descriptor table,
used by Windows emulators.
.It Cd options REALBASEMEM=integer
Overrides the base memory size passed in from the boot block.
(Value given in kilobytes.)
Use this option only if the boot block reports the size incorrectly.
(Note that some
.Tn BIOS Ns es
put the extended
.Tn BIOS
data area at the top of base memory, and therefore report a smaller
base memory size to prevent programs overwriting it.
This is correct behavior, and you should not use the
.Em REALBASEMEM
option to access this memory).
.It Cd options REALEXTMEM=integer
Overrides the extended memory size passed in from the boot block.
(Value given in kilobytes.
Extended memory does not include the first megabyte.)
