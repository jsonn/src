.Sh NAME
.Nm aic
.Nd Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aic0 at isa? port 0x340 irq 12"
.Cd "aic* at isapnp?"
.Cd "aic* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at aic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Adaptec
AIC-6260 and AIC-6360
.Tn SCSI
controller chips.
.Pp
The
.Tn ISA
attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports the
.Tn Adaptec
152x, the
.Tn "Creative Labs"
SoundBlaster
.Tn SCSI
host adapter, and compatibles.
Many
.Tn ISA
cards that use this chip do not have boot ROMs, and therefore cannot
be used to connect the boot device.
.Pp
The
.Tn "ISA Plug-and-Play"
attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports the
.Tn Adaptec
AHA-1520B host adapter.
.Pp
The
.Tn PCMCIA
attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports the
.Tn Adaptec
APA-1460.
These
.Tn SCSI
host adapters do not include boot ROMs and therefore cannot be used
to connect the boot device.
