.Sh NAME
.Nm aic
.Nd Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aic0 at isa? port 0x340 irq 12"
.Cd "aic* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at aic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Adaptec AIC-6260 and AIC-6360 SCSI
controller chips.
.Pp
The ISA attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports the Adaptec 152x, the Creative Labs SoundBlaster SCSI
host adapter, and compatibles.  Many ISA cards that use this chip do
not have boot ROMs, and therefore cannot be used to connect the boot
device.
.Pp
The PCMCIA attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports the Adaptec APA-1460.  These SCSI host adapters
do not include boot ROMs and therefore cannot be used to connect the
boot device.
