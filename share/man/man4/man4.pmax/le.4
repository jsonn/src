.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd
DECstation AMD 7990 LANCE ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le? at mainbus	with le_pmax"		(3100 baseboard)
.Cd "le*? at tc	with le_tc"		(5000/200 baseboard)
.Cd "le? at ioasic  with le_ioasic"	(ioasic baseboard)
.Cd "le* at tc?	with le_tc"		(TC option cards)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provies access to a 10Mb/s Ethernet via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip.  All
.Tn LANCE
interfaces on
.Tn DECstations  
are supported, as are interfaces on
.Tn "Alpha AXP"
machines with a
.Tn TurboChannel
bus.
.Pp
The
.Nm 
driver employs the Address Resolution Prootocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.  Selective recption of multicast Ethernet frames is provided
by a 64-bit mask; multicast destination addresses are hashed to a
bit entry using the Ethernet CRC function.
.Pp
No support is provided for switching between media ports.  The
DECstation 3100 provides both AUI and BNC  (thinwire or 10base2) connectors.
Port selection is via a manual switch and is not software configurable.
The
.Tn DECstation
model 5000/200
.Tn PMAD-AA
baseboard device provides only a BNC connector.
The
.Nm ioasic
baseboard devices and  the 
.Tn PMAD-AA
.Tn TurboChannel
option card provide only an AUI port.

.Sh BUGS
On all front-ends, performance is impaired by hardware whic forces
forces a software copy of packets to and from DMA buffers.  The
.Nm ioasic
machines  and the Decstation 3100 must 
copying packet to and from non-contiguous DMA buffers.
The 
Decstation 5000/200  and the
.Tn PMAD-AA 
must copy to and from an onboard SRAM DMA
buffer.  The CPU overhead is noticeable, but all machines can sustain
10Mbit media speed.
.Sh HISTORY
This
.Nm
driver is derived from a
.NM
driver that first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
Support for  multiple bus attachments first appeared in
.Nx 1.2 .
