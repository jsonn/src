.Sh NAME
.Nm px
.Nd
TURBOChannel PMAG-C   2-D accelerated graphics board
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "px* at tc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides minimal support for a
.Tn DEC
.Tn PMAG-C
video display option card.
The
.Nm
driver does nothing except remove the requirement to remove
.Tn PMAG-C 
cards in order to boot
.Nx . 
It offers no support for either raster consoles
or X11 servers.
To do either requires using the undocumented packet 
protocol used to talk to the on-board blitter chip.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rcons 4 ,
.Xr tc 4 ,
.Xr ws 4 .
.Sh BUGS
.Pp
Console output support and X11 server support should be implemented.
They are not.
.Pp
The
.Nm rcons
glass-tty raster framebuffer console driver assumes
direct bit read/write access to a framebuffer. The
.Nm
hardware does not provide this.
.Nm rcons 
should be replaced with a driver that allows a character-painting
interface as well as direct blitting.
.Pp
The only known X
server is an Ultrix binary which requires emulation of the Ultrix Xws
ABI. Work on this is in progress.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver 
first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
