.Nm px
.Nd
TURBOchannel ``PixelStamp'' accelerated graphics boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "px* at tc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn DEC
.Tn PixelStamp 
video display option cards:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent -compact
.It Sy PX
(PMAG-C) 8 plane, 2D
.It Sy PXG
(PMAG-D) 8 plane, 3D, 128kB SRAM
.It Sy PXG+
(PMAG-E) 24 plane, 3D, 128kB SRAM
.It Sy PXG+ Turbo
(PMAG-F) 24 plane, 3D, 256kB SRAM, Z-Buffer
.El
.Pp
.Tn PixelStamp
based cards do not provide direct framebuffer access but instead use
a packet-based protocol to communicate with the stamp, which in turn
manipulates the framebuffer. 
.Pp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rcons 4 ,
.Xr tc 4 .
.Sh BUGS
Interrupt handling, packet queuing and hardware clipping for the
.Nm PXG
are totally broken. Support for the
.Nm i860
co-processor must first be added.
.Pp
The X server is a work in progress.
.Pp
3D geometry acceleration is not supported, and probably never will be.
