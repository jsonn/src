driver provides support for the
.Tn DEC
.Tn PixelStamp 
video display option cards:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
PMAG-C (PX) 8 plane, 2D
.It
PMAG-D (PXG) 8 plane, 3D, 128kB SRAM
.It
PMAG-E (PXG+) 24 plane, 3D, 128kB SRAM

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rcons 4 ,
.Xr tc 4 .
.Sh BUGS
Interrupt handling, packet queuing and hardware clipping for the
.Nm PXG
are totally broken. Support for the
.Nm i860
co-processor must first be added.
.Pp
The X server is a work in progress.
.Pp
3D geometry acceleration is not supported, and probably never will be.
.Pp
Only one of the listed boards can be installed at any given time. Work is
underway to remove this restriction.
