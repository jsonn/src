.Sh NAME
.Nm lk201
.Nd
DEC LK-201 keyboard input driver
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Digital
.Tn LK-201
keyboard and its successors.
This support is automatically configured into the kernel,
to map keypress input events into ASCII codes.
There is no way to disable this support.
.Pp
The kernel also includes support for an in-kernel ring-buffer
structure for keypress events and pointer (mouse) events.
The
.Nm fb
driver redirects mouse and keyboard input into this in-kernel
structure, and updates the position of a framebuffer cursor sprite to
track the mouse.
This is for compatibility with the 
.Nm qv
QVSS-style software interface used by X11 on DECstation and VAXstation
framebuffers.
This design offers significantly better performance on the
VAXstation-100 and VAXstation-II, but makes it impossible to use
alternative pointer or keyboard devices.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
support should be re-written as a real driver or as a pseudo-device driver.
The
.Nm
driver should use an in-kernel streams facility, if one existed.
