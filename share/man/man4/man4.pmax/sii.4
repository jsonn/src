.Sh NAME
.Nm sii
.Nd
SII SCSI adaptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sii0 at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn DEC
SII SCSI adaptor ASIC used in
the DECstation 2100, 3100, and 5100, and in the VAXstation 3100.
.Pp
The
.Nm
is a medium-performance implementation of the SCSI-I common command set
supporting synchronous and asychronous SCSI devices.
.Pp
The SII cabling is unusual: the bulkhead connector is very similar
to a standard submicro wide SCSI-II connector, but has the other gender.
.Pp
The
.Nm
chip only supports DMA to or from a fixed window in memory.
The driver uses this "window" area as a bounce buffer, copying data
to and from the DMA region.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only supports the
.Nm oldscsibus
higher-level layer, and the
.Nm rz
and
.Nm tz
devices, which first appeared in 
.Bx 4.4 /pmax.
It should be re-written to support the
.Nm scsibus
machine-independent higher-level SCSI layer and the
.Nm sd ,
.Nm st ,
and
.Nm cd
drivers.
This is
.Ud .
