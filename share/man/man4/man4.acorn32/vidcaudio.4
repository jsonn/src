.Sh NAME
.Nm vidcaudio
.Nd VIDC audio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vidcaudio0 at vidc0"
.Cd "audio*     at vidcaudio0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the audio system of the
.Tn ARM VIDC20
and of the video and sound macrocell of the
.Tn ARM7500
and
.Tn ARM7500FE .
.Pp
The driver can work in two modes, either using the internal 8-bit
DACs of the
.Tn VIDC20
and its internal reference clock,
or using the serial sound output of any supported chip
feeding external 16-bit DACs and an external sound clock.
On systems with a
.Tn VIDC20 ,
the choice of mode is based on the
.Ql *Configure SoundSystem
setting under
.Tn RISC \&OS .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was introduced in
.Nx 1.2 .
The driver was largely rewritten for
.Nx 2.0
because it had bit-rotted so far as to be useless.
.Sh AUTHORS
The first version was written by Melvin Tang-Richardson.
The rewrite was by Ben Harris.
