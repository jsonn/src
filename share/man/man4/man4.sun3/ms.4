where
.Dq b
is the button state, encoded as
.Li 0x80|(~buttons)
-- there are three buttons (4=left, 2=middle, 1=right) --
and
.Dq \&dx
and
.Dq \&dy
are X and Y delta values, none of which are in the range
.Bq Li 0x80..0x87 .
.Pp
The device special file
.Pa /dev/mouse
is used to get direct access to the mouse input stream. The following
