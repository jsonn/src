.Sh NAME
.Nm tcds
.Nd TURBOchannel dual-channel SCSI adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tcds* at tc? slot ? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the DEC TURBOchannel PMAZ-DS, PMAZ-FS,
PMAZB-AA and PMAZC-AA dual-channel SCSI adapters.  Each channel is
driven by the
.Xr asc 4
driver.  The PMAZ-FS (Alpha onboard only) and PMAZC-AA (option board)
provide two Fast Narrow SCSI busses, while the PMAX-DS (Alpha onboard
only) and PMAZB-AA only provide Narrow SCSI.  For the onboard Alpha
controllers, one bus is for internal devices and one bus for external
devices.
