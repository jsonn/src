.Sh NAME
.Nm dtide
.Nd HCCS IDE interface driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hcide* at podulebus0 slot ?"
.Cd "ata* at hcide? channel ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles an HCCS IDE interface plugged into an Acorn expansion
slot.  It uses the standard
.Nx
IDE controller driver, and hence can use the standard
.Nm atabus
driver.
.Pp
The card provides three IDE channels.  The internal 44-way IDE connector is
channel 0, the internal 40-way connector is channel 1 and the external
connector is channel 2.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atabus 4 ,
.Xr atapibus 4 ,
.Xr podulebus 4 ,
.Xr wd 4
.Sh BUGS
The driver was derived by reverse-engineering the card, so it may not handle
the card entirely optimally.
