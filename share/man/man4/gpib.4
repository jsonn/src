.Sh NAME
.Nm cec
.Nd support for the IEEE488 GPIB
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gpib* at cec?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the IEEE488 general-purpose interface bus (GPIB).
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width XdevXgpibXX -compact
.It Pa /dev/gpib?
GPIB device special file

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cs80bus 4 ,

.Xr rd 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The user-level interface to the gpib driver current doesn't do
anything useful.
The GPIB subsystem places the unfortunate constraint that the
local GPIB controller is always the controller in charge (CIC).
