.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides the basic functions for the
.Xr wd 4
and
.Xr atapi 4
drivers. This driver supports IDE and EIDE controllers, as well as MFM, RLL
and ESDI on the ISA bus. PCI IDE controllers in legacy mode are also supported,
but the
.Xr pciide 4
driver may provide more functionaliy.
.Pp
For the ISA front-end, the 0x01 flag enables 32-bit I/O negotiation in
the driver. This is known to cause problems with some motherboards.
