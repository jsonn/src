(Ether1) Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ei* at podulebus0 slot ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

driver provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through an
Acorn
.Tn AKA25
Ethernet card (also known as

after its
.Tn RISC \&OS
driver).
The card is based on the Intel 82586.

is through links on the board (LK3\(enLK8 and LK10), so there are no media
options available through the driver.
