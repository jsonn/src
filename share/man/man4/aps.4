.Sh NAME
.Nm aps
.Nd ThinkPad Active Protection System accelerometer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aps0 at isa? port 0x1600"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for several sensors found in some ThinkPad laptops.
.Pp
The sensors currently exposed via the
.Xr envsys 4
interface are:
.Bl -column "Sensor          " "Units" "Typical" -offset indent

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.8
and then was ported to
.Nx
5.0.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jonathan Gray Aq jsg@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
Few issues can be mentioned.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Nm
driver does not maintain state and subsequently does not take
evasive action when it thinks the hard drive is in danger.
Possible actions would include spinning down the hard drive
in case excessive tremor is detected by the sensors.
.It
The Y axis on X40 and possibly other models seems to be inverted.
It is unknown how to distinguish between different versions of the
accelerometer to compensate for this in the driver at this time.
.It
The sensor values are refreshed every 0.5 seconds.
Because no protection measures are taken,
this is unnecessary and may have a negative effect on battery life.
.It
As IBM provides no documentation, it is not known what all the available
sensors are used for.
