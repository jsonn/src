.Sh NAME
.Nm sdtemp
.Nd Microchip Technology MCP9805/98242 and compatible memory module
temperature sensors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sdtemp0 at iic? addr 0x18"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Microchip Technology
MCP9805/98242 and other chips that conform to JEDEC Standard 21-C section
4.7.
Memory module temperature sensors are optional on DDR2 and DDR3 SDRAM DIMMs.
Sensors provided by this driver are accessed through the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
The on-chip thresholds for the Alarm Window and Critical level are
accessed through the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports temperature ranges from -256 to +255 degrees C.
.Sh HARDWARE
