.Cd "dpti* at iop? tid 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver attaches to
.Tn DPT
and
.Tn Adaptec
IOPs, and provides the pass-through command interface used by the

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.5.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Andrew Doran
.Aq ad@netbsd.org ,
using code provided by
.Tn Adaptec
and
.Tn Distributed Processing Technology
as a base.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver currently does not implement the I2ORESET, SYSINFO or TARGET_BUSY
ioctls, meaning that a minority of
.Nm raidutil
actions won't work, including online firmware upgrades.
