.Sh NAME
.Nm unixbp
.Nd Unix Backplane driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd unixbp0 at ioc0 bank 6
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver controls the interrupt-masking hardware on the expansion-card
backplane of certain systems.  This hardware gives
.Nx
the ability to selectively block interrupts from particular expansion
cards, and to determine which cards are currently generating interrupts by
examining a single register.
