.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm iobus
.Nd Device driver for the I/O bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd iobus0 at root
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Systems supported by
.Nx Ns /acorn26
have a 16-bit I/O bus connected to the CPU bus by bi-directional buffers
managed by the IOC.  The
.Nm
driver provides support for this bus.  All
.Nx Ns /acorn26
kernels need this driver.
.Pp
On Archimedes systems, the only device attached at
.Nm
is the IOC.  While MEMC podules are physically
.Nm
devices, they're logically treated as being attached to the IOC.  On
machines with an IOEB, the Universal Peripheral Controller chip is also
attached at
.Nm .
