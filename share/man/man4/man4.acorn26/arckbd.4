.Sh NAME
.Nm arckbd
.Nd Archimedes keyboard/mouse driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "arckbd0         at ioc0 bank 0 offset 0x04"
.Cd "wskbd0          at arckbd0"
.Cd "wsmouse0        at arckbd0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver controls the keyboard on systems supported by
.Nx Ns /acorn26
and interfaces it to the
.Nm wscons
system.
All communication between user programs and the
.Nm
driver goes through the
.Nm wskbd
and
.Nm wsmouse
drivers.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4 ,
.Xr wsmouse 4
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver is capable of determining the layout of the keyboard, and noticing when
it changes (if a different keyboard is connected, for instance), but doesn't
know how to pass this information on to
.Nm wscons .
