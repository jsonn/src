.Nm ifmedia
.Nd network interface media settings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/socket.h>
.Fd #include <net/if.h>
.Fd #include <net/if_media.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides a consistent method for querying and setting
network inerface media and media options.  The media is typically
set using the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
.Pp
There are currently four link types supported by
.Nm Ns :
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width IFM_IEEE80211 -compact
.It IFM_ETHER
Ethernet
.It IFM_TOKEN
Token Ring
.It IFM_FDDI
FDDI
.It IFM_IEEE80211
IEEE802.11 Wireless LAN
.El
.Pp
The following sections describe the possible media settings for each
link type.  Not all of these are supported by every device; refer to
your device's manual page for more information.
.Pp
The lists below provide the possible names of each media type or option.
The first name in the list is the canonical name of the media type or
option.  Additional names are acceptable aliases for the media type or
option.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Bsx 3.0 .
The implementation that appeared in
.Nx 1.3
was written by Jonathan Stone and Jason R. Thorpe to be compatible with
the BSDI API.  It has since gone through several revisions which have
extended the API while maintaining backwards compatibility with the
original API.
.Pp
Support for the
.Sy IEEE802.11 Wireless LAN
link type was added in
.Nx 1.5 .
