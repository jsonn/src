.Dt DTIDE 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dtide
.Nd D.T. Software IDE interface driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dtide* at podulebus0 slot ?"
.Cd "atabus* at dtide? channel ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles a D.T. Software IDE interface plugged into an Acorn expansion
slot.  It uses the standard
.Nx
IDE controller driver, and hence can use the standard
.Nm atabus
driver.
.Pp
The card provides two IDE channels.  The external IDE connector is channel 0,
while the internal connector is channel 1.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atabus 4 ,
.Xr atapibus 4 ,
.Xr podulebus 4 ,
.Xr wd 4
.Sh BUGS
The driver was derived by reverse-engineering the card and its
.Tn RISC OS
driver, so it may not handle the card entirely optimally.
