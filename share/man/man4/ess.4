.Sh NAME
.Nm ess
.Nd ESS Technology AudioDrive family audio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ess0   at isa? port 0x220 irq 5 drq 1 drq2 5"
.Cd "ess*   at isapnp?"
.Cd "ess*   at ofisa?"
.Cd "audio* at ess?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the ESS 1788, 1888, 1887, and 888 AudioDrive 
audio devices.
.Pp
The AudioDrive 1788 is a half-duplex device, while the 1888, 1887, and
888 are full-duplex. All are capable of 8- and 16-bit audio sample
recording and playback at rates up to 44.1kHz.
.Pp
The AudioDrive takes 16 I/O ports. The I/O port range, IRQ, and DRQ
channels are set by the driver to the vaues specified in the
configuration file (or for isapnp or ofisa, the values assigned from
the firmware). The I/O port base must be one of 0x220, 0x230, 0x240,
0x250. The IRQ must be one of 5, 7, 9, 10 (or 15 on the 1887
only). The first DRQ channel must be selected from 0, 1, 3. The second
DRQ channel (used for playback by the full-duplex 1888/1887, ignored
by the 1788) can additionally be set to 5. If both DRQ channels are
used they must be different.
.Pp
The joystick interface (if enabled) is handled by the
.Xr joy 4
driver. 
.Sh BUGS
The AudioDrive devices have a SoundBlaster compatibility mode, and may
be detected by the SoundBlaster driver (see 
.Xr sb 4 )  
rather than the AudioDrive driver. The workaround is to remove the
SoundBlaster driver from the kernel configuration.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
