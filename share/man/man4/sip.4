.Sh NAME
.Nm sip
.Nd SiS 900-based Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sip* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs is also necessary.  See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Ethernet interfaces based on the Silicon
Integrated Systems SiS 900, SiS 7016, and National Semiconductor
DP83815 Ethernet chips.
.Pp
The SiS 900 is found on many motherboards featuring SiS chipsets,
and on some embedded systems, and has a built-in PHY.  The SiS 7016
is an older version of the chip, which uses an external PHY.
.Pp
The National Semiconductor DP83815 is found on NetGear FA-311 and
FA-312 Ethernet boards, and has a built-in PHY.
