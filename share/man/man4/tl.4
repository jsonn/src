.Sh NAME
.Nm tl
.Nd Ethernet driver for Texas Instruments ThunderLAN based board
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tl* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs are necessary.  See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tl
device driver supports network adapters based on
the Texas Instruments ThunderLAN chip.
.Sh HARDWARE
Supported cards include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx -offset indent
.It Compaq Netelligent 
in baseboard and PCI variants (10bT-only variant untested).
.It Compaq NetFlex 3/P
in baseboard variant only (the PCI variant doesn't use the same chip !).
.It It Baseboard Compaq Deskpro 4000 5233MMX Ethernet
(This has been tested on the Deskpro 4000M only).
.It TI TravelMate 5000 series laptop docking station's Ethernet board.
.El
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The different models of the supported boards come with some subset of RJ-45,
BNC and AUI connectors.  Media selection is done using
.Xr ifconfig 8
using the standard
.Xr ifmedia 4
mechanism.  Refer to those manual pages for more information.
.Pp
The
.Nm 
driver don't have full automatic media selection. By default it will do an NWay
on the UTP port for negotiation of the speed and duplex mode with the
link partner. If the AUI or BNC port is used, an explicit medium must be
specified to
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your /etc/ifconfig.tl? file.
.in -4
.Sh BUGS
The board marked as untested will always claim having an AUI connector, where
it may be a BNC one.
