.Sh NAME
.Nm tl
.Nd Ethernet driver for Texas Instruments ThunderLAN based board
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tl* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "mii* at tl?"
.Cd "tlphy* at mii?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tl
device driver supports network adapters based on
the Texas Instruments ThunderLAN chip on i386 CPUs.
Supported cards include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx -offset indent
.It Compaq Netelligent 
in baseboard and PCI variants (10bT-only and dual-port variants untested).
.It Compaq NetFlex 3/P
in baseboard and PCI variants (only baseboard variant tested).
.It Baseboard Compaq Deskpro 4000 5233MMX ethernet (untested).
.It TI TravelMate 5000 series laptop docking station's ethernet board.
.El

.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The different models of the supported boards come with some subset of RJ-45,
BNC and AUI connectors.   Supported media include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxx -offset indent
.It AUI/DIX
Standard 15 pin connector
.It 10Base2
BNC, also known as thin-net
.It 10BaseT
UTP, also known as twisted pair
.It 100baseTX
100Mbit over cat-5 UTP
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm 
driver don't have automatic media selection, and there is no media selected
by default. An explicit medium must be specified to
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your /etc/ifconfig.tl? file. The media option
.Em full-duplex
can be used to switch the UTP port in full-duplex mode.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Dl "tl0: no carrier"
.Dl "nsphy0: 10baseT: no carrier"
.in +4
means that the driver detected a carrier loss. This usually indicates a bad
link.
.in -4
.Sh BUGS
.Pp
The board marked as untested will always claim having an AUI connector, where
it may be a BNC one.
.Pp
The driver really should have a media autosensing function.
.Pp
On AUI and BNC ports, false carrier loss may be detected on heavily-loaded
networks.
