.Sh NAME
.Nm rcons
.Nd raster console access
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options RASTERCONSOLE_FGCOL=n
.Cd options RASTERCONSOLE_BGCOL=n

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for machine-independent access to the raster
console.  Use of the
.Nm
driver is deprecated in favour of the
.Xr wscons 4
machine-independent console driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides simple raster and frame buffer routines.  It's enough
to implement a console terminal emulator on monochrome and
pseudo-colour screens.
