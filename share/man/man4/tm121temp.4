.Sh NAME
.Nm tm121temp
.Nd Texas Instruments TMP121 temperature sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tm121temp0 at spi? slave 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Texas Instruments
(formerly
.Tn Burr-Brown )
TMP121 temperature sensor
with the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
These devices are connected to the host system with
.Xr spi 4
or
.Tn Microwire
4-wire serial busses.
The
.Nm
is capable of measuring temperatures with a 2 degree accuracy
over the frame from -40 to 125 Celsius.
Temperatures are reported with a
granularity of 625 microKelvins.
.Pp
.Nm
devices can transfer information at up to 10MHz, and support
SPI mode 0.
.Pp
The device reports itself with
.Xr envsys 4
using the generic device name.
This name can be overridden, by specifying an alternate name in the device
property
.Dq envsys-description .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr envsys 4 ,
.Xr spi 4 ,
.Xr envstat 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Garrett D'Amore
and first appeared in
.Nx 4.0 .
