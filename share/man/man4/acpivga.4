.Sh NAME
.Nm acpivga
.Nd ACPI Display Adapter and Output Devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acpivga* at acpi?"
.Cd "acpiout* at acpivga?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides generic support for brightness control and output switching,
through
.Tn ACPI
video extensions.
The
.Tn ACPI
specification requires that systems containing a built-in display adapter
implement these extensions in their
.Tn ACPI
BIOS.
.Pp
The driver handles brightness hotkeys and output switch hotkeys.
In addition, the following
.Xr sysctl 8
read/write variables are provided (when hardware support is available):
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Va hw.acpi.acpivga0.policy
BIOS switch policy.
Accepted values range from 0 to 7.
For more information, refer to the documentation of the _DOS method,
in Section B.4.1 of the
.Tn ACPI
specification (revision 4.0a).
.It Va hw.acpi.acpiout0.brightness
Brightness level.
Typical values range from 0 to 100, but any integer value is accepted (the
driver uses the closest brightness level supported by the device).
.El
.Pp
Please note, however, that future versions of
.Nm
may remove these
.Xr sysctl 8
variables without prior notice.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
driver supports the
.Em ACPI Extensions for Display Adapters
given in Appendix B of the
.Tn ACPI
specification.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 6.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Gr\('egoire Sutre
.Aq gsutre@NetBSD.org
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver only supports PCI/PCI-X/PCI-E display adapters.
.Pp
Many
.Tn ACPI
BIOSes implement only part of the
.Tn ACPI
video extensions.
In particular, display output switching often does not work.
.Pp
Brightness level should be controlled via
.Xr wsconsctl 8
instead of
.Xr sysctl 8 .
