.Sh NAME
.Nm ym
.Nd Yamaha OPL3-SA3 audio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ym*    at isapnp?"
.Cd "ym*    at pnpbios? index ?"
.Cd "audio* at ym?"
.Cd "mpu*   at ym?"
.Cd "opl*   at ym?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Yamaha YMF715x (OPL3-SA3) sound devices.
.Pp
The OPL3-SA3 device has
WSS compatible full-duplex 16bit CODEC,
OPL3 FM synthesizer,
MPU401 compatible MIDI I/O port interface,
and built-in
.Sq 3D Enhanced
equalizer.
.Pp
The joystick interface is handled by the
.Xr joy 4
driver.
.Sh MIXER DEVICE
The mixer device of
.Nm
driver can be accessed by
.Xr mixerctl 1
command.
The layout is shown below.

.Ed
.Pp
Note that the
.Sq Dv inputs.dac
is twice as sensitive as other
.Sq Dv inputs
volume variables.
.Pp
The hardware volume changes the
.Sq Dv outputs.master
value.
.Pp
If the device is in global power down or power save mode,
the output is automatically muted
and none of the input source can be heard.
To hear the external inputs while the parts are unused, use the
.Sq Dv nosave
mode of the driver.
See
.Sx POWER MANAGEMENT
section below for the details of power management.
.Sh POWER MANAGEMENT
The
.Nm
driver is capable of power management on the OPL3-SA3 devices.
The following modes can be selected by setting
.Sq Dv power.power
variable of
.Xr mixerctl 1
to
.Sq Dv powerdown ,
.Sq Dv powersave ,
and
.Sq Dv nosave
respectively.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Global power-down mode
When a subpart of the device is unused, the part is power-down after
a timeout period (specified by
.Sq Dv power.power.timeout
variable of
.Xr mixerctl 1
in seconds).
When all the subpart of the devices are unused,
the driver puts the device in
.Sq Global Power Down
mode.
.Pp
On the global power down mode, the power consumption is minimized
(10\(*mA typ.),
.\" Note: \(*m is Greek mu
but the click noise on power up/down the device is rather loud.
.Bf Em
This mode should not be used with headphones or hi\-fi audio systems,
or your ears or the systems may be damaged.
.Ef
.It Power save mode
When a subpart of the device is unused, the part is powered-down after
a timeout period (specified by
.Sq Dv power.power.timeout
variable of
.Xr mixerctl 1
in seconds).
When all the subparts of the device are unused,
the driver put the device in
.Sq Power Save
mode.
.Pp
In power save mode, the power consumption is reduced (5mA typ.).
The click noise on power up/down of the device is very small,
but this operation requires muting/unmuting the device, which make some noise.
In order to reduce the noise, setting the master volume at the small value
is effective.
.It "No power-save mode"
Once the device is powered-up, it remains on after the use of the device.
Once a subpart of the device is powered-up, it shall not be power-down.
This mode minimizes click noises on power switching,
but maximizes power consumption (30-100mA).
.Pp
On suspending, the device is put into power-save state.
.El
.Sh BUGS
Although the parameters of the device are saved and restored on
.Xr apm 4
suspend/resume, the DMA state is not restored.
That is, if the system suspends during playback,
this is not continued after suspend/resume cycle.
.Pp
The joystick port is not under power management.
If a
.Xr joy 4
device is configured,
the device will never be put in global power down or power save mode.
.Pp
The external devices, such as Zoomed Video port, OPL4-ML/2, modem, and CD-ROM
are not supported.
