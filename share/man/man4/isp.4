.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd Qlogic based SCSI or FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isp* at pci? dev? function?" Pq PCI
.Cd "isp* at sbus? slot ? offset ?" Pq SBus
.Cd scsibus* at isp?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to a
.Tn SCSI
bus or a
.Tn FibreChannel
connected to
.Tn Qlogic
ISP1000 (SBus), ISP1020 (PCI), ISP1040(PCI), ISP1080(PCI),
.Tn SCSI
host adapters or ISP2100(PCI)
.Tn FibreChannel
host adapters.
.Pp
Features include support for UltraSCSI and wide mode transactions for
.Tn SCSI ,
and LVD (for the ISP1080),
and the FCP SCSI profile for
.Tn FibreChannel .
Command tagging is supported for all (in fact,
.Tn FibreChannel
requires tagging).
.Sh CONFIGURATION
An optional
.Tn flags 0x80
appended to the above
.Tn isp*
declarations will disable the download of driver f/w, which means you
use whatever F/W is running on the card. If no firmware is running on the card,
you will lose.
.Sh BUGS
The driver currently ignores some NVRAM settings.
.Pp
The driver currently doesn't do error recovery for timed out commands
very gracefully.
.Pp
Fabric Support (for FibreChannel) is not supported yet.
