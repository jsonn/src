.Sh NAME
.Nm wss
.Nd Windows Sound System hardware audio driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wss0   at isa? port 0x530 irq 10 drq 0 drq2 1"
.Cd "wss0   at isa? port 0x530 irq 10 drq 0 flags 1"
.Cd "wss*   at isapnp?"
.Cd "wss*   at pnpbios? index ?"
.Cd "audio* at wss?"
.Cd "opl*   at wss?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Microsoft's Windows Sound System, MAD16 chip based
hardware and their clones.
.Pp
The base I/O port is set by a jumper on the board; valid choices are
0x530, 0x604, 0xE80, or 0xF40.
Both IRQ and DMA channels are software programmable.
The IRQ may be set to 7, 9, 10, or 11, and
the DMA channel may be set to 0, 1, or 3.
.Pp
The configuration file must have bit 1 set in
.Cm flags
to enable the MAD16 support.  This is to avoid potential
conflicts with other devices when probing the MAD16 because it requires
use of extra I/O ports not in the base port range.
Chips needing this flag are, e.g., OPTi 82C928, 82C929, 82C831,
and OAK OTI-601D.
Bit 2 in 
.Cm flags
disables the joystick port on MAD16 hardware.
