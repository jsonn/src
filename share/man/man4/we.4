.Sh NAME
.Nm we
.Nd device driver for Western Digital/SMC WD80x3, SMC Elite Ultra,
and SMC EtherEZ Ethernet cards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "we0 at isa? port 0x280 iomem 0xd0000 irq 9"
.Cd "we1 at isa? port 0x300 iomem 0xcc000 irq 10"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Western Digital/SMC WD80x3, SMC Elite Ultra, and
SMC EtherEZ Ethernet cards.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The ability to select media from software is dependent on the particular
model of WD/SMC card.  The following models support only manual configuration:
WD8003S, WD8003E, and WD8013EBT.
.Pp
Other WD/SMC 80x3 interfaces support two types of media on a single card.
All support the AUI media type.  The other media is either BNC or UTP
beind a transciever.  Sofware cannot differentiate between BNC and UTP
cards.  On some models, the AUI port is always active.
.Pp
The SMC Elite Ultra and SMC EtherEZ interfaces support three media
a single card: AUI, BNC, and UTP.  If the transciever is active, the BNC
media is selected.  Otherwise, the AUI and UTP ports are both active.
.Pp
To enable the AUI media, select the
.Em 10base5
or
.Em aui
media type with
.Xr ifconfig 8 's
.Sq media
directive.  To select the other media (transciever), select the
.Em 10base2
or
.Em bnc
media type.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "we0: overriding IRQ <n> to <m>"
The IRQ specified in the kernel configuration file is different from that
found in the card's configuration registers.  The value in the kernel
configuration file is being overridden by the one configured into the card.
.It "we0: can't wildcard IRQ on a <model>"
The IRQ was wildcarded in the kernel configuration file, and the card is
a WD8003S, WD8003E, or WD8013EBT, which do not support software IRQ
configuration.
.It "we0: failed to clear shared memory at offset <off>"
The memory test was unable to clear shared the interface's shared memory
region.  This often indicates that the card is configured at a conflicting
.Em iomem
address.
