.Sh NAME
.Nm ukbd
.Nd USB keyboard support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ukbd*  at uhidev? reportid ?"
.Cd "wskbd* at ukbd? console ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB keyboards (i.e., HID devices
with reports in usage page 7).
Access to the keyboard is through the
.Xr wscons 4
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr uhidev 4 ,
.Xr usb 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver is brought into action rather late in the boot process, so if
it is used as the console driver then
.Xr ddb 4
is not usable until late in the boot.
