.Sh NAME
.Nm cms
.Nd Creative Music System device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cms0  at isa? port 0x220"
.Cd "midi* at cms?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Creative Music System (C/MS).
These cards were developed by Creative Labs, the same people who
designed the SoundBlaster cards.  Chips were available for the
SoundBlaster to make them compatible with CMS.
.Pp
The CMS cards are only capable of playing basic notes and noises,
making them suitable for playing midi, but not much else.  The output
is stereo, but the
.Nm
driver doesn't support stereo control.  The cards have external volume
control, line-output and speaker.
.Pp
The base I/O port address is usually jumper-selected to 0x220.  Valid
jumper settings are for 0x210, 0x220, 0x230, 0x240, 0x250 and 0x260.
There are no interrupt settings.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
