.Tn AKA25
(Ether1) Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd ei* at podulebus0 slot ?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through an
Acorn
.Tn AKA25
Ethernet card (also known as
.Dq Ether1
after its
.Tn RISC OS
driver).  The card is based on the Intel 82586.

Media selection on the
.Tn AKA25
is through links on the board (LK3\(enLK8 and LK10), so there are no media
options available through the driver.
