.Os NetBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm isa
.Nd introduction to machine-independent ISA bus support and drivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pp
Attachmens are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
ISA bus interface of your system.  See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for details.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Nx
includes a machine-independent ISA bus subsystem and several
machine-independent ISA device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional ISA devices.  Drivers for ISA
device not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
