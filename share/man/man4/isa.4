.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isa
.Nd introduction to machine-independent ISA bus support and drivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pp
Attachments are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
.Tn ISA
bus interface of your system.
See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for details.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Nx
includes a machine-independent
.Tn ISA
bus subsystem and several machine-independent
.Tn ISA
device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional
.Tn ISA
devices.
Drivers for
.Tn ISA
device not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
