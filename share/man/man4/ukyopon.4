.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ukyopon
.Nd Kyocera AIR-EDGE PHONE support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ukyopon* at uhub?"
.Cd "ucom*    at ukyopon?"
.Pp
.In dev/usb/ukyopon.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Kyocera AIR-EDGE PHONE AH-K3001V.
.Pp
Two units of this driver attach to an AIR-EDGE PHONE:
the modem port and the data transfer port.
The modem port is compatible to
.Xr umodem 4 ,
and can be used for dialup connections.
The data transfer port is for reading and writing internal storage
of AIR-EDGE PHONE.
.Pp
Both devices are accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes them behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply to the
.Nm
device:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX
.It Dv UKYOPON_IDENTIFY Fa struct ukyopon_identify
Read, from the kernel, the identification information of the device,
useful to assure that the opened device node is
a modem or a data transfer port of
.Nm
device.
.Bd -literal
struct ukyopon_identify {
	char	ui_name[16];		/* driver name */

	int	ui_busno;		/* usb bus number */
	uint8_t	ui_address;		/* device address */

	enum ukyopon_model {
		UKYOPON_MODEL_UNKNOWN
	} ui_model;			/* possibly future use */
	enum ukyopon_port {
		UKYOPON_PORT_UNKNOWN,
		UKYOPON_PORT_MODEM,	/* modem port */
		UKYOPON_PORT_DATA	/* data transfer port */
	} ui_porttype;			/* port type */
	int	ui_rsvd1, ui_rsvd2;
};
#define UKYOPON_NAME		"ukyopon"
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va ui_name
field contains the driver signature, and has the string
.Dv UKYOPON_NAME .
.Pp
The
.Va ui_busno
field contains the
.Xr usb 4
bus number to which the device is connected;
the
.Va ui_address
field contains the address of the device in the bus.
These fields are useful to identify the physical device
from the file descriptor.
.Pp
The
.Va ui_porttype
field contains the type of device:
.Dv UKYOPON_PORT_MODEM
means the device is associated to the modem port, and
.Dv UKYOPON_PORT_DATA
means the device is associated to the data transfer port.
.Pp
Other fields are reserved for future extension and cleared to zeros.
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Nm
devices accept all
.Xr ioctl 2
calls that
.Xr umodem 4
accepts.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr ucom 4 ,
.Xr umodem 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 3.0 .
.Sh NOTES
.Dq Kyopon
is a widely-used nickname of Kyocera AIR-EDGE PHONE.
.Sh BUGS
This driver currently supports only the first two ports,
and the third port is not supported.
