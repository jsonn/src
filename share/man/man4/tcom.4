.Nm tcom

multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
For 4-port TC-400 series boards:
.Pp
.Cd "tcom0 at isa? port 0x100 irq 5"
.Cd "com2 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com3 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com4 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com5 at tcom? slave ?"
.Pp
For 8-port TC-800 series boards:
.Pp
.Cd "tcom0 at isa? port 0x100 irq 5"
.Cd "com2 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com3 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com4 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com5 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com6 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com7 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com8 at tcom? slave ?"
.Cd "com9 at tcom? slave ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tcom
driver provides support for the Byte Runner Technologies TC-400
and TC-800 series boards that multiplex together up to four or eight
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to eight
.Nm com
devices.  The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in the synopsis.  The slave ID given for each
.Nm com
device determines which bit in the interrupt multiplexing register is
tested to find interrupts for that device.
The
.Tn port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices and the port for the interrupt multiplexing register.
.Pp
Not all possible configuration options are currently supported (for
example, speeds beyond 115200 baud are not currently supported).
