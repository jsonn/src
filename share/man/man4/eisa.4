.Nd Introduction to EISA bus machine-independent drivers and support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pp
Machine-dependent; depends on the bus topology and EISA-bus interface
of your system. Typical EISA buses are either connected directly
to the main system bus, or via an PCI-to-EISA bridge.
See the
.Xr intro 4
documentation for your system for details.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
