.Nd Micrel 8842/8841 PCI Ethernet controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "kse* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Ethernet interfaces based on the Micrel 8842/8841
PCI Ethernet chips.  The 8842 has 2 Ethernet ports which behave as
a managed switch to bridge each other.  It works like a T-shape
connector of Ethernet data flow in which an Ethernet controller
sits at the leg of the T.  Frames can flow between the two ports
while traffic destined for the 8842 reaches the EMAC. The 8841 is
a plain 10/100 Ethernet.
The
.Nm
driver distinguishs and handles them according to the HW model.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Tohru Nishimura .
.Sh BUGS
__STRICT_ALIGNMENT case is not written.  8842 media selection
keeps "auto" and indicates "up 100baseTX-FX flow" when either of
two ports is found link-up.  There is no functional provision to
see and control the media selection of them this moment.  Advanced
features like flow volume bound, VLAN tag insertion/removal, QoS
DiffServ are not implemented and remain uncontrollable by the
.Nm
driver.
UDP4CSUM is not very useful since the HW has an implementation
error for the case when a large UDP datagram is fragmented into
MTU sized frames.
