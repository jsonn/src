.Sh NAME
.Nm wsmux
.Nd console keyboard/mouse multiplexor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wskbd*     at ... mux N"
.Cd "wsmouse*   at ... mux N"

.Cd pseudo-device  wsmux    N
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a pseudo-device driver that allows several
.Xr wscons 4
input devices to have their events multiplexed into one stream.
.Pp
The typical usage for this device is to have two multiplexors, one
for mouse events and one for keyboard events.  All
.Xr wsmouse 4
devices should direct their events to the mouse mux (normally 0)
and all keyboard devices, except the console, should direct their
events to the keyboard mux (normally 1).  A device will
send its events to the mux indicated my the
.Va mux
locator.  If none is given the device will not use a multiplexor.
The keyboard multiplexor should be connected to the display, using
the
.Xr wsconscfg 8
command.  It will then recieve all keystrokes from all keyboards
and, furthermore, keyboards can be dynamically attached and detached without
further user interaction.
In a similar way, the window system will open the mouse multiplexor
and recieve all mouse events; mice can also be dynamically attached 
and detached.
.Pp
It is also possible to inject events into a multiplexor from a
user program.  This is used by the
.Xr moused 8
deamon to take data from a mouse connected to a serial port and
make it appear on the standard mouse mux.
