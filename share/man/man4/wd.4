.Sh NAME
.Nm wd 
.Nd WD100x compatible hard disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wd* at wdc? channel ? drive ? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "wd* at pciide? channel ? drive ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm wd 
driver supports hard disk which emulate the Western
Digital WD100x.  This includes standard MFM, RLL, ESDI, IDE and EIDE
drives.
.Pp
The flags are used only with controllers that support DMA operations and
mode settings (like some pciide controllers).
The lowest order nibble (rightmost digit) of the flags define the PIO mode
to use, the next set of four bits the DMA mode and the third nibble the
UltraDMA mode.
For each set of four bits, the 3 lower bits define the mode to use
and the last bit must be set to 1 for this setting to be used.
For DMA and UDMA, 0xf (1111) means 'disable'.
For example, a flags value of 0x0fac (1111 1010 1100) 
means 'use PIO mode 4, DMA mode 2, disable UltraDMA'.
0x0000 means "use whatever the drive claims to support.
