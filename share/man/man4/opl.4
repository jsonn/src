.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Yamaha OPL2 (YM3812) and OPL3
(YMF262) chips.  The chips are FM synthesizers and are capable
of producing a wide range of sounds.
.Pp
Access to the device is through the MIDI driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver usually attaches to a sound card, but it can also sit
directly on the ISA bus.
.Pp
If
.Dq flags 1
is specified, the
.Nm
driver handles left and right channels of OPL3 swapped.
Use this flag if your device has such problem.
