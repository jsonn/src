.Nd PC keyboard driver for wscons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pckbc* at isa?
.Cd pckbd* at pckbc?
.Cd wskbd* at pckbd? console ?
.Cd options PCKBD_LAYOUT=XXX
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver supports PC/AT keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework. It doesn't provide direct device
driver entry points but makes its functions available via
the internal
.Xr wskbd 4
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports a number of different key mappings which
can be chosen from with the kernel option
.Dq PCKBD_LAYOUT
at compile time or with the utility
.Xr wsconsctl 8
(variable:
.Dq encoding
) at runtime.
Other mappings can be used if the whole keymap is replaced by means of
.Xr wsconsctl 8 .
The builtin mappings are at this time:
.Bl -hang
.It KB_US
(for wsconsctl:
.Dq us
) English / US keyboard mapping (default).
.It KB_DE
(
.Dq de
) German with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_DE | KB_NODEAD
(
.Dq de.nodead
) German without
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_FR
(
.Dq fr
) French.
.It KB_DK
(
.Dq dk
) Danish with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_DK | KB_NODEAD
(
.Dq dk.nodead
) Danish without
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_IT
(
.Dq it
) Italian.
.It KB_UK
(
.Dq uk
) British.
.It KB_JP
(
.Dq jp
) Japanese.
.It KB_US | KB_DECLK
(
.Dq us.declk
) English / US mapping for
.Tn DEC
LK400-style keyboards with PC keyboard interface (eg LK461).
.It KB_US | KB_SWAPCTRLCAPS
(
.Dq us.swapctrlcaps
) English / US mapping with swapped
.Dq Control
and
.Dq Caps Lock
keys.
.It KB_JP | KB_SWAPCTRLCAPS
(
.Dq jp.swapctrlcaps
) Japanese mapping with swapped
.Dq Control
and
.Dq Caps Lock
keys.
.El
.Pp
Because PC keyboard hardware doesn't contain a beeper, requests for
.Dq keyboard beeps
cannot be handled directly. On alpha and i386 a helper device attached
to the
.Xr pcppi 4
driver allows to use the standard ISA speaker for this purpose.
.Sh BUGS
The list of builtin mappings doesn't follow any logics.
It grew as people submitted what they needed.
