.Sh NAME
.Nm lm
.Nd National Semiconductor LM78, LM79 and compatible hardware monitors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lm0 at isa? port 0x290"
.\" .Cd "lm0 at pnpbios0 index ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn National Semiconductor
LM series hardware monitors and register compatible chips to be used with
the
.Xr envsys 4
API.
.Pp
Most supported devices possess 11 sensors:
.Bl -column "Sensor" "Units" "Typical" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "IN0" Ta "uV DC" Ta "Core voltage"
.It Li "IN1" Ta "uV DC" Ta "unknown"
.It Li "IN2" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+3.3V"
.It Li "IN3" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+5V"
.It Li "IN4" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+12V"
.It Li "IN5" Ta "uV DC" Ta "-12V"
.It Li "IN6" Ta "uV DC" Ta "-5V"
.It Li "Temp" Ta "uK" Ta "Motherboard Temperature"
.It Li "Fan0" Ta "RPM" Ta "Fan"
.It Li "Fan1" Ta "RPM" Ta "Chassis Fan"
.It Li "Fan2" Ta "RPM" Ta "Fan"
.El
for some devices (most Winbond devices) sensors names and numbers will be
different.
.Pp
Sensor names as well as nominal RPMs for fans 0 and 1 may be changed
through the
.Dv ENVSYS_STREINFO
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Pp
Due to hardware limitations, fresh sensor data is only available every
1.5 seconds.
.Sh HARDWARE
Chips supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
.Tn National Semiconductor
.Em LM78
and
.Em LM78-J
.It
.Tn National Semiconductor
.Em LM79
.It

.Em W83781D
and
.Em W83782D 
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr envstat 1
.Xr envsys 4
.Sh BUGS
Interrupt support is unimplemented.
.Pp
There are currently no known pnpbios IDs assigned to LM chips. 
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
