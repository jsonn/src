.Sh NAME
.Nm fxp
.Nd Intel i82557, i82558, and i82559 Ethernet interfaces device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fxp* at cardbus? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "fxp* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Ethernet interfaces based on the Intel i82557
and i82558 PCI Ethernet chips.  The i82557 uses an external media
interface, whereas the i82558 includes a built-in Intel i82555 PHY.
The i82559 is an enhanced i82558.
.Pp
.Sh HARDWARE
Cards supported by the 
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Intel EtherExpress Pro 10+
.It
Intel EtherExpress Pro 100B
.It
Intel EtherExpress Pro 100+
.El
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
Media selection is supported via MII.  See
.Xr ifmedia 4
and
.Xr mii 4
for more information.
.Pp
EtherExpress Pro 10+ boards may use a Seeq 80c24 AutoDUPLEX(tm)
media interface.  Boards with these chips do not support media
selection, as the 80c24 has no programming interface, and no
way to read link status.  These boards claim a media of "manual"
since they self-configure based on the configuration of the link
partner (hub or switch).
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "fxp0: WARNING: SCB timed out!"
The driver timed out waiting for the chip's command interface to
become ready.
.It "fxp0: too many segments, aborting"
The driver encountered a packet that included too many DMA segments,
and was not able to allocate a new buffer to transmit the packet from.
The packet has been dropped.
.It "fxp0: too many segments, retrying"
The driver encountered a packet that included too many DMA segments,
and allocated a new buffer to transmit the packet from.
.It "fxp0: can't load mbuf chain, error = %d"
The driver was unable to load a transmit DMA map, and has reported the
errno value.
.It "fxp0: device timeout"
The device failed to generate a transmit complete interrupt for the
last packet transmitted.  The device has been reset.
.It "fxp0: can't load rx buffer, error = %d"
The driver was unable to load the DMA map for a receive buffer, and
has reported the errno value.  This error is currently fatal, and will
panic the system.
.It "fxp0: fxp_mdi_read: timed out"
The MDIO failed to become ready during an MII read operation.
.It "fxp0: fxp_mdi_write: timed out"
The MDIO failed to become ready during an MII write operation.
