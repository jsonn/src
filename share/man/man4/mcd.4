.Nd Mitsumi CD-ROM driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mcd0 at isa? port 0x300 irq 10"
.Cd "#options MCD_PROMISC"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Tn Mitsumi
.Tn CD-ROM
controller and drive on the
.Xr isa 4
bus.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
hardware is  difficult to probe accurately.
Historically, the 
.Nm
probe would accept any return values as indicating that an
.Nm
drive was present.  Other devices, particularly
.Xr ne 4
or 
.Xr we 4 ,
would then be incorrectly claimed by the
.Nm
driver.  The driver now only accepts result codes known to indicate
Mitsumi-compatible CD controllers, but may reject some
.Nm
hardware which  returns other result codes.
.Pp
.Cd "options MCD_PROMISC"
enables the  original promiscuous probe behaviour. Use with extreme caution.
