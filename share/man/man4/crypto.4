.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver gives user-mode applications access to hardware-accelerated
cryptographic transforms, as implemented by the
.Xr opencrypto 9
in-kernel interface.
The
.Cm swcrypto
driver is a software-only implementation of the
.Xr opencrypto 9
interface, and must be included to use the interface without hardware
acceleration.
The
.Pa /dev/crypto
special device provides an
.Xr ioctl 2
based interface.
User-mode applications should open the special device,
then issue
.Xr ioctl 2
calls on the descriptor.
The
.Nm
device provides two distinct modes of operation: one mode for
symmetric-keyed cryptographic requests, and a second mode for
both asymmetric-key (public-key/private-key) requests, and for
modular exponentiation (for Diffie-Hellman key exchange).
The two modes are described separately below.
.Sh SYMMETRIC-KEY OPERATION
The symmetric-key operation mode provides a context-based API
to traditional symmetric-key encryption (or privacy) algorithms,
or to keyed and unkeyed one-way hash (HMAC and MAC) algorithms.
The symmetric-key mode also permits fused operation,
where the hardware performs both a privacy algorithm and an integrity-check
algorithm in a single pass over the data: either a fused
encrypt/HMAC-generate operation, or a fused HMAC-verify/decrypt operation.
.Pp
To use symmetric mode, you must first create a session specifying
the algorithm(s) and key(s) to use; then issue encrypt or decrypt
requests against the session.
.Ss Symmetric-key privacy algorithms
Contingent upon device drivers for installed cryptographic hardware
registering with
.Xr opencrypto 9 ,
as providers of a given algorithm, some or all of the following
symmetric-key privacy algorithms may be available:
.Bl -tag -compact -width CRYPTO_RIPEMD160_HMAC -offset indent
.It CRYPTO_DES_CBC
.It CRYPTO_3DES_CBC
.It CRYPTO_BLF_CBC
.It CRYPTO_CAST_CBC
.It CRYPTO_SKIPJACK_CBC
.It CRYPTO_AES_CBC
.It CRYPTO_ARC4
.El
.Ss Integrity-check operations
Contingent upon hardware support, some or all of the following
keyed one-way hash algorithms may be available:
.Bl -tag -compact -width CRYPTO_RIPEMD160_HMAC -offset indent
.It CRYPTO_RIPEMD160_HMAC
.It CRYPTO_MD5_KPDK
.It CRYPTO_SHA1_KPDK
.It CRYPTO_MD5_HMAC
.It CRYPTO_SHA1_HMAC
.It CRYPTO_SHA2_HMAC
.It CRYPTO_MD5
.It CRYPTO_SHA1
.El
The
.Em CRYPTO_MD5
and
.Em CRYPTO_SHA1
algorithms are actually unkeyed, but should be requested
as symmetric-key hash algorithms with a zero-length key.
.Ss IOCTL Request Descriptions
.\"
.Bl -tag -width CIOCFKEY
.\"
.It Dv CRIOGET Fa int *fd
This operation is deprecated and will be removed after
.Nx 5.0.
It clones the fd argument to
.Xr ioctl 4 ,
yielding a new file descriptor for the creation of sessions.  Because the
device now clones on open, this operation is unnecessary.
.\"
.It Dv CIOCGSESSION Fa struct session_op *sessp
Create a new cryptographic session on a file descriptor for the device;
that is, a persistent object specific to the chosen
privacy algorithm, integrity algorithm, and keys specified in
.Fa sessp .
The special value 0 for either privacy or integrity
is reserved to indicate that the indicated operation (privacy or integrity)
is not desired for this session.
.Pp
Multiple sessions may be bound to a single file descriptor.  The session
ID returned in
.Fa sessp\*[Gt]ses
is supplied as a required field in the symmetric-operation structure
.Fa crypt_op
for future encryption or hashing requests.
.Pp
This implementation will never return a session ID of 0 for a successful
creation of a session, which is a
.Nx
extension.
.Pp
For non-zero symmetric-key privacy algorithms, the privacy algorithm
must be specified in
.Fa sessp-\*[Gt]cipher ,
the key length in
.Fa sessp-\*[Gt]keylen ,
and the key value in the octets addressed by
.Fa sessp-\*[Gt]key .
.Pp
For keyed one-way hash algorithms, the one-way hash must be specified
in
.Fa sessp-\*[Gt]mac ,
the key length in
.Fa sessp-\*[Gt]mackey ,
and the key value in the octets addressed by
.Fa sessp-\*[Gt]mackeylen .
.\"
.Pp
Support for a specific combination of fused privacy  and
integrity-check algorithms depends on whether the underlying
hardware supports that combination.
Not all combinations are supported
by all hardware, even if the hardware supports each operation as a
stand-alone non-fused operation.
.It Dv CIOCCRYPT Fa struct crypt_op *cr_op
Request a symmetric-key (or unkeyed hash) operation.
The file descriptor argument to
.Xr ioctl 4
must have been bound to a valid session.
To encrypt, set
.Fa cr_op-\*[Gt]op
to
.Dv COP_ENCRYPT .
To decrypt, set
.Fa cr_op-\*[Gt]op
to
.Dv COP_DECRYPT .
The field
.Fa cr_op-\*[Gt]len
supplies the length of the input buffer; the fields
.Fa cr_op-\*[Gt]src ,
.Fa cr_op-\*[Gt]dst ,
.Fa cr_op-\*[Gt]mac ,
.Fa cr_op-\*[Gt]iv
supply the addresses of the input buffer, output buffer,
one-way hash, and initialization vector, respectively.
.It Dv CIOCFSESSION Fa void
Destroys the /dev/crypto session associated with the file-descriptor
argument.
.El
.\"
.Sh ASYMMETRIC-KEY OPERATION
.Ss Asymmetric-key algorithms
Contingent upon hardware support, the following asymmetric
(public-key/private-key; or key-exchange subroutine) operations may
also be available:
.Bl -column "CRK_DH_COMPUTE_KEY" "Input parameter" "Output parameter" -offset indent -compact
.It Em "Algorithm" Ta "Input parameter" Ta "Output parameter"
.It Em " " Ta "Count" Ta "Count"
.It Dv CRK_MOD_EXP Ta 3 Ta 1
.It Dv CRK_MOD_EXP_CRT Ta 6 Ta 1
.It Dv CRK_DSA_SIGN Ta 5 Ta 2
.It Dv CRK_DSA_VERIFY Ta 7 Ta 0
.It Dv CRK_DH_COMPUTE_KEY Ta 3 Ta 1
.El
.Pp
See below for discussion of the input and output parameter counts.
.Ss Asymmetric-key commands
.Bl -tag -width CIOCFKEY
.It Dv CIOCASSYMFEAT Fa int *feature_mask
Returns a bitmask of supported asymmetric-key operations.
Each of the above-listed asymmetric operations is present
if and only if the bit position numbered by the code for that operation
is set.
For example,
.Dv CRK_MOD_EXP
is available if and only if the bit
.Pq 1 \*[Lt]\*[Lt] Dv CRK_MOD_EX
is set.
.It Dv CIOCFKEY Fa struct crypt_kop *kop
Performs an asymmetric-key operation from the list above.
The specific operation is supplied in
.Fa kop-\*[Gt]crk_op ;
final status for the operation is returned in
.Fa kop-\*[Gt]crk_status .
The number of input arguments and the number of output arguments
is specified in
.Fa kop-\*[Gt]crk_iparams
and
.Fa kop-\*[Gt]crk_iparams ,
respectively.
The field
.Fa crk_param[]
must be filled in with exactly
.Fa kop-\*[Gt]crk_iparams + kop-\*[Gt]crk_oparams
arguments, each encoded as a
.Fa struct crparam
(address, bitlength) pair.
.El
.Pp
The semantics of these arguments are currently undocumented.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver is derived from a version which appeared in
.Fx 4.8 ,
which in turn is based on code which appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .
.Sh BUGS
Error checking and reporting is weak.
.Pp
The values specified for symmetric-key key sizes to
.Dv CIOCGSESSION
must exactly match the values expected by
.Xr opencrypto 9 .
The output buffer and MAC buffers supplied to
.Dv CIOCCRYPT
must follow whether privacy or integrity algorithms were specified for
session: if you request a
.No non- Ns Dv NULL
algorithm, you must supply a suitably-sized buffer.
.Pp
The scheme for passing arguments for asymmetric requests is Baroque.
.Pp
The naming inconsistency between
.Dv CRIOGET
and the various
.Dv CIOC Ns \&*
names is an unfortunate historical artifact.
