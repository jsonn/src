.Dt USCANNER 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uscanner
.Nd minimal USB support for scanners
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uscanner* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides minimal support for USB scanners.
The driver recognizes a number of USB scanners, but to
actually scan anything there needs to be software that knows
about the particular scanner.  The SANE package provides
support for some scanners.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver works with the following scanners:
.Ss Epson
.Bl -tag -width Dv -offset indent -compact
.It GT-7000
.It Perfection 610U
.It Perfection 636U
.It Perfection 1200U
.It Perfection 1200U Photo
.It Perfection 1260
.It Perfection 1660
.It Perfection 2400
.El
.Ss HP
.Bl -tag -width Fl -offset indent -compact
.It ScanJet 4100C
.It ScanJet 5200C
.\" .It ScanJet 5300C
.It ScanJet 6300C
.El
.\" .Ss Microtek
.\" .Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.\" .It ScanMaker X6USB
.\" .El
.Pp
Many other scanners are recognized, but there is no software support
for them yet.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh BUGS
This driver should not really exist.  The scanners it recognizes
can be accessed through the
.Xr ugen 4
driver instead.  A proper scanner driver would provide a uniform
interface to scanners instead of exposing the innards of the
scanner.
The reason the driver exists is to have something that is compatible
with the Linux driver.
