.Sh NAME
.Nm pci
.Nd introduction to machine-independent PCI bus support and drivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pp
.Cd "pci* at ppb? bus ?"
.Pp
Other
.Nm
attachments are machine-dependent and depend on the bus topology and
PCI bus interface of your system.  See
.Xr intro 4
for your system for details.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Nx
includes a machine-independent PCI bus subsystem and
several machine-independent PCI device drivers.
.Pp
Your system may support additional PCI devices.  Drivers for PCI
devices not listed here are machine-dependent.
Consult your system's
.Xr intro 4
for additional information.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
.Nx
includes machine-independent PCI drivers, sorted by device type and
driver name:
