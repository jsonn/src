.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh BUGS
.Ss IO space conflicts
.Nx 
probes the
.Tn PCMCIA
IO bus width and uses that information to decide
where to map
.Tn PCMCIA
IO space. For 10-bit wide cards, 0x300-0x3ff is
used. For 12-bit wide cards, 0x400-0x4ff is used.
.Pp
Neither choice is perfect. In the 12-bit case, 0x400 appears to work
on substantially more devices than 0x300. In the event that
.Tn PCMCIA
devices are mapped in 0x400-0xfff and appear to be nonfunctional,
remapping to 0x300-0x3ff may be appropriate; consult
.Cd options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE
and
.Cd options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE
in
.Xr options 4 .
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Avoid pcmcia bus space conflicts with the default io space
# allocation on 12-bit wide busses (base 0x400 size 0xfff).
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOBASE=0x300
options PCIC_ISA_ALLOC_IOSIZE=0x0ff
.Ed
.Ss Interrupt conflicts
.Nx
attempts to probe for available interrupts to assign to
.Tn PCMCIA
devices. In some cases, it is not possible to detect
all interrupts in use; in such cases, use of
.Cd options PCIC_ISA_INTR_ALLOC_MASK
may be necessary. See
.Xr options 4 .
