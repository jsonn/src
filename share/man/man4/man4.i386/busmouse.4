.Dt BUSMOUSE 4 i386
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm busmouse
.Nd Busmouse protocol
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <machine/mouse.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Many mouse drivers internally convert the protocol
the mouse uses natively to a common busmouse protocol.
.Pp
The drivers allow information to be retrieved from the driver using an
.Xr ioctl 2
call or by reading the device directly using
.Xr read 2 .
.Pp
The
.Dv MOUSEIOCREAD
.Xr ioctl 2
is defined in the header
.Aq Pa machine/mouse.h .
It returns a
.Li struct mouseinfo .
.Pp
When reading the mouse device directly, each change of button state or
mouse movement generates a five byte event.
The bytes contain:
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It 1
Button status. (u_char)
.It 2
Right/left movement.  Positive values indicate right, negative
left. (char)
.It 3
Up/down movement.  Positive values indicate up, negative down. (char)
.It 4
Reserved.  Should be zero. (char)
.It 5
Reserved.  Should be zero. (char)
.El
.Pp
The direction bytes are signed characters, giving a range of +127 to -127.
A positive value indicates movement to the right or up, and a negative
value movement left or down.
