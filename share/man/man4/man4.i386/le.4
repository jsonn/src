.Sh NAME
.Nm le 
.Nd Ethernet driver for Lance based Ethernet boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le0 at isa? port 0x320 irq 10 drq 7              # ISA  boards"
.Cd "le* at pci? dev? function ?                      # PCI boards"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
Lance Ethernet chips.  The ISA-bus Ethernet cards supported by the
.Nm
interface are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indet -compact
.It BICC Isolan 
.It Novell NE2100
.It Digital DEPCA
.El
.Pp
