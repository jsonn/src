.Sh NAME
.Nm rtfps
.Nd
multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "master rtfps0 at isa? port 0x1230 irq 10"
.Cd "device com2 at rtfps0 slave 0"
.Cd "device com3 at rtfps0 slave 1"
.Cd "device com4 at rtfps0 slave 2"
.Cd "device com5 at rtfps0 slave 3"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rtfps
driver provides support for IBM RT PC boards that multiplex together up to four
.Rn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
or
.Tn RS-422A
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to four 
.Nm com
devices.  The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in the synopsis.  The kernel configuration specification
for each slave
.Nm com
device can optionally omit the 
.Tn port
specification, in which case the slaves are assumed to be at
sequential addresses.  The
.Tn port
specification for the
.Nm
device is taken as the default port for the first slave
.Nm com
device.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by Charles Hannum, based on the
.Nm ast
driver.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver is unlikely to work on non-EISA and non-PCI machines.  The ISA
bus only asserts 10 I/O address lines, and this is not enough.
.Pp
Even on EISA and PCI machines, some address conflicts have been observed.
On one machine, the second port always conflicted with something (though
it's not clear what) and caused strange results.  Disabling the second
port in the kernel config allowed the other three ports to function
correctly.
