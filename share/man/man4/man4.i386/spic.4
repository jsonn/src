.Sh NAME
.Nm spic
.Nd Sony Programmable I/O Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spic*    at acpi?"
.Cd "wsmouse* at spic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Some
.Tn Sony
computers have an I/O controller that handles various interface
devices, e.g., the jog dial.  The
.Nm
driver provides support for some of these.
.Pp
The actual protocol used by the
.Tn SPIC
seems to vary a lot between different models; this driver has only
been tested on the Vaio SRX77.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver handles the jog dial and its associated buttons.  They are turned
into a
.Nm wsmouse
which can the be accessed in the normal way.  The jog dial works as a
scroll button, and clicking it generates a click with the "middle" button.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr wsmouse 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only works with some hardware configurations.
