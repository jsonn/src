Interruptless parallel port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" XXX this is awful hackery to get it to work right... -- cgd
.Cd "device lpa0 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT0\&" tty
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to parallel ports.  It assumes that
the parallel port controller will not cause an interrupt, and
therefore must poll the controller.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /dev/lpa0
first interruptless parallel port driver
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lpt 4
.Sh BUGS
This driver only exists to support broken parallel port implementations.
Systems with properly working parallel ports should use the
.Nm lpt
driver instead, as it is less resource-hungry.
.Pp
This driver could stand a rewrite.
