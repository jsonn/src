Numeric Processing Extension coprocessor and emulator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options MATH_EMULATE"
.\" XXX this is awful hackery to get it to work right... -- cgd
.Cd "device npx0 at isa? port" \&"IO_NPX0\&" tty irq 13 vector npxintr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm npx
driver enables the use of the system's Numeric Processing Extension
coprocessor,
if one is present.  Numeric processing extensions are present in
systems with
.Nm 486DX
CPUs and in systems with
.Nm 387
or
.Nm 487SX
coprocessors.  The
.Nm npx
driver is required for proper system functioning regardless
of whether or not a NPX is present.
.Pp
If there is no NPX present in the system, the "MATH_EMULATE"
option must be defined in the kernel configuration file.
It will provide support for the instructions normally executed
by the NPX.  If there is no NPX in the system and the kernel
is not built with math emulation, the system will not boot.
.Sh CAVEATS
The emulator is much slower than the NPX coprocessor.
This will result in poor floating-point math performance
if the emulator must be used.
.Sh BUGS
There are lots of them, especially on cheap motherboards.  In particular,
some motherboards do not have the interrupt lines from the NPX to
the CPU wired properly.  If this is the case, the emulator must be used
if consistent system operation is desired.
.Pp
Emulation of the transcendental functions instructions is incorrect.
Emulation of other instructions is suspect.
