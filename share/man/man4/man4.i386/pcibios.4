.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Nx
provides support for setting up PCI controllers, bridges, and devices
using information extracted from the BIOS.
.Pp
Ideally, the boot firmware of a machine (a.k.a. BIOS) should set
up all PCI devices; assigning them I/O and memory addresses and
interrupts.  Alas, this does not always happen, so there is some
PC specific code that can do the initialization when
.Nx
boots.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width PCIBIOS_INTR_FIXUP -offset 3n -compact
.It Nm PCIBIOS
turn on the PCI BIOS support.
.It Nm PCIBIOSVERBOSE
make the setup procedure verbose.
.It Nm PCIBIOS_INTR_FIXUP
fixup PCI interrupt routing.
.It Nm PCIBIOS_IRQS_HINT
hint for IRQ use.
When the PCI BIOS support cannot
guess an adequate IRQ for a device the hint is used.
.It Nm PCIINTR_DEBUG
super-verbose PCI interrupt fixup.
.It Nm PCIBIOS_BUS_FIXUP
fixup PCI bus numbering; needed for many 
.Xr cardbus 4
bridges.
.It Nm PCIBIOS_ADDR_FIXUP
fixup PCI I/O and memory addresses.
