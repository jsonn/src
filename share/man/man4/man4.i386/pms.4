.Nd PS/2 auxiliary port mouse driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pms* at pckbc?
.Cd wsmouse* at pms?
.Cd opms* at pckbc?
.Cd opms0 at pc? irq 12
.Cd opms0 at vt? irq 12
.Cd options PMS_RESET_AND_DISABLE
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides an interface to a PS/2 auxiliary port mouse.
Mouse related data are accessed by
.Xr wsmouse 4
devices.
The
.Dq opms
versions are provided for compatibility. The
.Dq opms
driver internally converts the PS/2 mouse output into
.Xr busmouse 4
protocol.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The option PMS_RESET_AND_DISABLE is available only if the
.Dq opms
device is attached to a
.Xr pc 4
or
.Xr pcvt 4
terminal driver. It causes the pms device to be reset when it
is probed and disabled when it is closed.
.Sh FILES
