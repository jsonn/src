.Sh DESCRIPTION
Media Independent Interface is an IEEE standard serial bus for
connecting MACs (network controllers) to PHYs (physical media
interfaces).  The
.Nm
layer allows network device drivers to share support code for
various PHY models, and allows unused support for PHYs which
are not present in a system to be removed from the kernel.
.Pp
Network device drivers which use the
.Nm
layer carry the
.Dq mii
autoconfiguration attribute.  This allows kernel configuration
files to simply specify PHYs as described above in the synopsis.
.Pp
The following is an example of the messages displayed when a network
interface with an attached PHY is detected by the kernel:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
epic0 at pci0 dev 12 function 0: SMC EPIC/100 Fast Ethernet
epic0: interrupting at kn20aa irq 4
epic0: SMC9432TX, Ethernet address 00:e0:29:07:17:c4
qsphy0 at epic0 phy 3: QS6612 10/100 media interface, rev. 1
qsphy0: 10baseT, 10baseT-FDX, 100baseTX, 100baseTX-FDX, auto
.Ed
.Pp
All PHY drivers display the media types supported by the PHY when it
is detected by the kernel.  These media types are valid media keywords
for use with the
.Xr ifconfig 8
program.
