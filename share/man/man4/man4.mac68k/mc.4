.Sh NAME
.Nm mc
.Nd Ethernet driver for Am79C940 (MACE) onboard Ethernet
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mc* at obio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the AMD Am79C940
(MACE) Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .  The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the
local network.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the on-board Ethernet of the following machines:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Centris 660AV
.It
Quadra 660AV
.It
Quadra 840AV
.El
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag -compact
.It mc0 at obio0: address %s.
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the 6 byte physical
Ethernet address of the adapter.
