.Sh NAME
.Nm iwm ,
.Nm fd
.Nd floppy disk driver for IWM and non-DMA SWIM controllers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iwm0 at obio?"
.Cd "fd* at iwm0 drive ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver interfaces to the built-in and external floppy disk drives on the
Macintosh. It supports double-density media, written in
Apple's proprietary GCR format. Currently, there is no disklabel
support for the floppy drives. Instead, the
.Nm
driver sets up a fake in-core disklabel, using the minor device
number to select from the supported disk formats.
.Pp
The following formats are supported:
.Bl -column Partition Size sides tracks sectors/track
.It Sy Partition Ta Sy Size Ta Sy sides Ta Sy tracks Ta Sy sectors/track
.It a Ta 800Kb Ta 2 Ta 80 Ta 10 (default)
.It b Ta 400Kb Ta 1 Ta 80 Ta 10
.It c Ta 800Kb Ta 2 Ta 80 Ta 10
.El
.Pp
(The above table describes the logical mapping as implemented by the
driver; the physical layout of GCR floppies has 8..12 sectors per track.)
.Sh FORMATTING
The
.Nm
driver does currently not support floppy disk formatting.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
Hauke Fath put together the beginnings of the
.Nm
driver in 1996 from the sparse documentation in "Inside Macintosh",
Neil Parker's "iwmstuff" documentation for the Apple IIgs and a long,
hard look at the .Sony driver.
.Sh BUGS
The FFS code is incapable of dealing with a varying number of
sectors per track. We have to fake a mapping and so lose FFS support
for hardware parameters like transition times.
.Pp
The driver only supports an obsolete format.
