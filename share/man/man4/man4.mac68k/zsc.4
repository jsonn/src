.Sh NAME
.Nm zsc
.Nd
serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "zsc0 at obio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Z8530- and Z85230-compatible
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.  The Z8530 has a 3 character buffer,
and the Z85230 has a 8 character buffer.  However, due to limitations in
the design of the Z85230, the driver is unable to distinguish it from
the Z8530 and will not enable any enhanced features of the controller.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, or any other baud rate which is a factor
of 115200.

.Sh BUGS
Data loss is possible when using high speeds, particularly on older (68020
or 68030) Macintosh models and on busy systems.
