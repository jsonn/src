.Sh NAME
.Nm dpt

.Tn DPT EATA SCSI adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dpt* at eisa? slot ?"
.Cd "dpt* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at dpt?"
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following
.Tn SCSI
adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It Tn DPT SmartCache III
.It Tn DPT SmartCache IV
.It Tn DPT SmartRAID III
.It Tn DPT SmartRAID IV
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
None of these messages should be encountered under normal circumstances. It
should be noted that the list below is not complete.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent 
.It dpt0: readcfg failed - see dpt(4)
.br
The EATA configuration data did not appear upon request. This may be caused
by older firmware. Generally the solution is to power-cycle the affected
machine.
.br
.It dpt0: spurious intr
.br
A spurious interrupt was recieved from the HBA.
.br
.It dpt0: bogus status (returned CCB id NNNN)
.br
A corrupt or incomplete status packet was recieved from the HBA.

.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Nm
driver was written by 
.An Andy Doran Aq ad@netbsd.org , 
based upon the 
.Nm uha
and
.Nm bha
drivers, which are the work of others.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm dpt
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
This manpage is inadaquate.
.Pp
EATA adapters other than listed may function correctly with the
.Nm 
driver, however a definitive list is not avaiable.
.Pp
Older firmware may prove problematic. It is recommended that the latest
available firmware be used. Contact DPT for a firmware update.
.Pp
Older boards that do not suppport scatter-gather I/O or DMA are not supported.
.Pp
An ISA front-end is needed.
.Pp
ECC formatted disk and arrays (i.e. with a sector size of 528 bytes) do not
work correctly with the PM2041 and certian firmware revisions of the PM3334.
