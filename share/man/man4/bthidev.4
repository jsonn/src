.Sh NAME
.Nm bthidev
.Nd Bluetooth Human Interface Device support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bthidev* at bthub?"
.Pp
.Cd "btkbd*   at bthidev? reportid ?"
.Cd "btms*    at bthidev? reportid ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles all Bluetooth Human Interface Devices.
Each HID device can have several components, e.g., a keyboard and
a mouse.
These components use different report identifiers to
distinguish which component data is coming from.
The
.Nm
driver may have several children attached that handle particular
components and dispatches data to them based on the report id.
.Pp
Normally, Bluetooth HIDs will be attached using the
.Xr btdevctl 8
program.
The following properties are used by the
.Nm
driver during autoconfiguration:
.Bl -tag -width interrupt_psmXX
.It local-bdaddr
Local device address.
.It remote-bdaddr
Remote device address.
.It service-name
The
.Nm
driver matches the
.Sq HID
service.
.It control-psm
This, if set, will indicate the PSM to use for the Control channel.
If not set,
.Dv L2CAP_PSM_HID_CNTL
will be used.
.It interrupt-psm
This, if set, will indicate the PSM to use for the Interrupt channel.
If not set,
.Dv L2CAP_PSM_HID_INTR
will be used.
.It descriptor
This required binary blob is the HID descriptor containing information about
reports the device will produce, and obtained via SDP.
.It reconnect
If this boolean value is set, and is true, then the
.Nm
driver will initiate reconnections to the remote device when no
connection is present.
.It link-mode
This optional string represents the link mode of the baseband link, and
may be one of
.Sq auth ,
.Sq encrypt ,
or
.Sq secure .
.El
.Pp
When the
.Nm
driver has configured its children, it will initiate a connection
to the remote device.
If this fails and the reconnect flag is not set, it will then wait for
the device to initiate the connection.

under the sponsorship of Itronix, Inc. and first appeared in
.Nx 4.0 .
