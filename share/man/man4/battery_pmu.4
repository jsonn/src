.Dt BATTERY 4
.Sh NAME
.Nm battery
.Nd support for batteries and related functionality in Apple Powerbook 2400,
3400 and 3500 (also known as Original PowerBook G3)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "battery* at pmu?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for batteries and hardware sensors found in 1st
generation PCI-based PowerBooks, currently it only exports a few sensors
via the
.Xr envsys 4
interface, including battery charge, voltage, CPU and battery temperature
and AC power availability.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr envsys 4 ,
.Xr pmu 4 ,
.Sh BUGS
There is no APM emulation right now and the battery current sensor may return
misleading or wrong data. This driver is considered preliminary and may be 
replaced at some point.
