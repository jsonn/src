.Sh NAME
.Nm iy
.Nd Ethernet driver for Intel i82595
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iy0 at isa? port {port} irq ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the EtherExpress PRO/10 card, and might support
other
.Tn ISA
cards using the same chip.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The different models of the supported boards come with some subset of RJ-45,
.Tn BNC
and
.Tn AUI
connectors.
Supported media include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxx -offset indent
.It AUI/DIX
Standard 15 pin connector
.It 10Base2
BNC, also known as thin-net
.It 10BaseT
UTP, also known as twisted pair
.El
.Pp
The default port to use is the port the card autodetects at
.Ic ifconfig up
time.
To choose an alternative port, an explicit medium can be specified to
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your
.Pa ifconfig.iy?
file.
.Pp
.Sh NOTES
The EtherExpress PRO card has no jumpers to set the address.
.Tn Intel
supplies software to set the address of the card in software.
You have to hardwire this address in your kernel configuration file.
