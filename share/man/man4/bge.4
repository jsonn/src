.Sh NAME
.Nm bge
.Nd Broadcom BCM570x family Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bge* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Pp
Configuration of PHYs may also be necessary.  See
.Xr mii 4 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Gigabit Ethernet interfaces based on the Broadcom
BCM570x family of Gigabit Ethernet chips and the BCM5906 chip.
The interfaces supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
3Com 3c996-T (10BASE-T/100BASE-TX/1000BASE-T)
.It
Dell PowerEdge 2550 integrated BCM5700 NIC (10BASE-T/100BASE-TX/1000BASE-T)
.It
IBM x235 server integrated BCM5703x NIC (10BASE-T/100BASE-TX/1000BASE-T)
.It
Netgear GA302T (10BASE-T/100BASE-TX/1000BASE-T)
.It
SysKonnect SK-9D21 (10BASE-T/100BASE-TX/1000BASE-T)
.It
SysKonnect SK-9D41 (1000BASE-SX)
.El
.Pp
The BCM570x family supports IPv4/TCP/UDP checksumming in hardware.
The
.Nm
driver supports this feature of the chip.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to enable this feature.
