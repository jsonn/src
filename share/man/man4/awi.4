AMD PCnetMobile IEEE 802.11 PCMCIA wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "awi*     at pcmcia? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports various IEEE 802.11 wireless cards
that run AMD PCnetMobile firmware based on the AMD 79c930 controller
with the Intersil (formerly Harris) PRISM radio chipset.
It provides access to 32kb of memory shared between the controller
and the host.
All host/device interaction is accomplished via this shared memory, which
can be accessed either via PCMCIA or I/O memory spaces.
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic in 802.11 frames.
.Pp
The driver works both in infrastructure mode and in ad-hoc (independent
BSS) mode.
.Pp
In infrastructure mode, it communicates with an Access Point,
which serves as a link-layer bridge between an Ethernet segment and
the wireless network.
An access point also provides roaming capability,
which allows a wireless node to move between access points.
.Pp
In ad-hoc mode, the device communicates peer to peer.
Although it is more efficient to communicate between wireless nodes,
the coverage is limited spatially due to the lack of roaming capability.
.Pp
In addition to these two modes in the IEEE 802.11 specification, the
.Nm
driver also supports a variant of ad-hoc mode outside of the spec for
DS radio cards.
This makes it possible to communicate with the WaveLAN ad-hoc mode of
.Xr wi 4
driver.
The NWID has no effect in this mode.
.Pp
Another mode added to the
.Nm
driver can be used with old Melco access points with 2Mbps cards.
This mode actually uses the IEEE 802.11 ad-hoc mode with encapsulation of
raw Ethernet packets (including headers) in 802.11 frames.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8
and
.Xr ifmedia 4 .
.Sh HARDWARE
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width BayStack_650x -offset indent -compact
.It BayStack 650
1Mbps Frequency Hopping PCCARD adapter
.It BayStack 660
2Mbps Direct Sequence PCCARD adapter
.It Icom SL-200
2Mbps Direct Sequence PCCARD adapter
.It Melco WLI-PCM
2Mbps Direct Sequence PCCARD adapter
.It NEL SSMagic
2Mbps Direct Sequence PCCARD adapter
.It Netwave AirSurfer Plus
1Mbps Frequency Hopping PCCARD adapter
.It Netwave AirSurfer Pro
2Mbps Direct Sequence PCCARD adapter
.It Nokia C020 WLAN
2Mbps Direct Sequence PCCARD adapter
.It Farallon SkyLINE
2Mbps Direct Sequence PCCARD adapter
.It Zoom Air Model 4000
.El
.Pp
The original Xircom Netwave AirSurfer is supported by the
.Xr cnw 4
driver, and the PRISM-II cards are supported by the
.Xr wi 4
driver.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
In addition to default
.Em Auto
media type,
the DS cards support
.Em DS1
and
.Em DS2
media types, while the FH cards support the
.Em FH1
media type.
For each media type, the
.Em adhoc
mediaopt can be used to indicate to the driver to operate in ad-hoc mode.
The
.Em flag0
mediaopt
should be used only with old access points, which operate in IBSS mode.
For DS radio cards, the
.Em adhoc,flag0
mediaopt can be used for
.Xr wi 4
compatible WaveLAN ad-hoc mode.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "awi0: no suitable CIS info found"
The device cannot be mapped due to a resource conflict.
Or, the device failed to initialize its firmware.
.It "awi0: failed to complete selftest (%s)"
The device failed to complete its self test.
In some circumstances, resetting device after power on fails.
Re-inserting the card or setting the interface up and then down again
(using
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
may also be helpful.
.It "awi0: transmit timeout"
The device failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a
transmitted packet.
.It "awi0: failed to lock interrupt"
The system was unable to obtain the lock to access shared memory.
.It "awi0: command %d failed %x"
The device failed to complete the request from the system.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The initial version of the
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Sommerfeld
.Aq sommerfeld@NetBSD.org .
It was then completely rewritten to support cards with the DS phy and
ad-hoc mode by
.An Atsushi Onoe
.Aq onoe@NetBSD.org .
