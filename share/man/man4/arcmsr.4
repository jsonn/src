.It
ARC-1680x PCI Express 8 Port SAS RAID Controller
.It
ARC-1681 PCI-X 8 Port SAS RAID Controller
.El
.Pp
These controllers support RAID levels 0, 1, 1E, 3, 5, 6, and JBOD
using either SAS or SATA II drives.
.Pp
.Nm
supports management and monitoring of the controller through the
.Xr bioctl 8
and
.Xr envstat 8
commands.
.Pp
Please note, however, that to use some features that require special
privileges, such as creating/removing hot-spares, pass-through disks
or RAID volumes will require to have the
.Em password
disabled in the firmware; otherwise a
.Em Permission denied
error will be reported by
.Xr bioctl 8 .
.Pp
When a RAID 1 or 1+0 volume is created, either through the
.Xr bioctl 8
command or controller's firmware, the volume won't be accessible until
the initialization is done. A way to get access to the
.Xr sd 4
device that corresponds to that volume without rebooting, is to issue
the following command (once the initialization is finished):
.Bd -literal
$ scsictl scsibus0 scan any any
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver will also report to the kernel log buffer any error that might
appear when handling firmware commands, such as used by the
.Xr bioctl 8
command.
.Sh EVENTS
The
.Nm
driver is able to send events to
.Xr powerd 8
if a volume or any drive connected to the volume is not online.
The
.Em state-changed
event will be sent to the
.Pa /etc/powerd/scripts/sensor_drive
script when such condition happens.
