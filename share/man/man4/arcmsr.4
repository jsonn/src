.Pp
These controllers can support RAID levels 0, 1, 1E, 3, 5, 6, and JBOD.
.Pp
.Nm
supports management of the controllers via the
.Xr bio 4
interface and the
.Xr bioctl 8
utility.
.Pp
Please note, however, that to use some features that require special
privileges, such as creating/removing hot-spares, pass-through disks
or RAID volumes will require to have the
.Em password
disabled in the firmware; otherwise a
.Em Permission denied
error will be reported by
.Xr bioctl 8 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver will also report to the kernel log buffer any error that might
appear when handling firmware commands, such as used by the
.Xr bioctl 8
utility.
