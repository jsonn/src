.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd SPARC AMD 7990 LANCE ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
The sun4m interface has two types of connectors:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It AUI/DIX
Standard 15 pin connector
.It 10BaseT
UTP, also known as twisted pair
.El
.Pp
The system will not automatically select the correct port unless the kernel
was loaded via the network. Thus one of the following flags should be used
with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your /etc/hostname.le? file:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It link0
Use the UTP port.
.It link1
Use the AUI port.
.It -link0 -link1
Use the existing port selection (useful only for network booting).
