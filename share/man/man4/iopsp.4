.Sh NAME
.Nm iopsp
.Nd I2O SCSI port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iopsp* at iop? tid ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at iopsp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for I2O SCSI bus adapter ports and child
peripherals.
.Pp
IOPs present each child peripheral attached to a bus adapter port as an
individual device.  In order to present the appearance of a bus, the
.Nm
driver groups child peripherals by controlling port.
.Pp
On IOPs containing a SCSI port and block or tape driver modules, some SCSI
devices may not be directly accessible.  For each inaccessible device, a
message will be displayed during configuration.  For example:
.Bd -literal
	iopsp0: target 0,0 (tid 70): in use by tid 47
.Ed
.Pp
Such devices will usually be indirectly accessible as block devices, either
individually or as part of an array.

driver first appeared in
