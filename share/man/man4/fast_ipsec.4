.Dt FAST_IPSEC 4

.Sh NAME
.Nm "Fast IPsec"
.Nd hardware-accelerated IP Security Protocols
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "options FAST_IPSEC"
.Cd "options IPSEC_NAT_T"
.Cd "pseudo-device crypto"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn IPsec
is a set of protocols,
.Tn ESP
(for Encapsulating Security Payload)
.Tn AH
(for Authentication Header),
and
.Tn IPComp
(for IP Payload Compression Protocol)
that provide security services for IP datagrams.
.Nm
is an implementation of these protocols that uses the
.Xr opencrypto 9
subsystem to carry out cryptographic operations.
This means, in particular, that cryptographic hardware devices are
employed whenever possible to optimize the performance of these protocols.
.Pp
In general, the
.Nm
implementation is intended to be compatible with the
.Tn KAME IPsec
implementation.
This documentation concentrates on differences from that software.
The user should refer to
.Xr ipsec 4
for basic information on setting up and using these protocols.
.Pp
System configuration requires the
.Xr opencrypto 9
subsystem.
When the
.Nm
protocols are configured for use, all protocols are included in the system.
To selectively enable/disable protocols, use
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
To be added.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr setkey 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
.Xr opencrypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The protocols draw heavily on the
.Ox
implementation of the
.Tn IPsec
protocols.
The policy management code is derived from the
.Tn KAME
implementation found in their
.Tn IPsec
protocols.
The
.Nm
protocols are based on code which appeared in
.Fx 4.7 .
The
.Nx
version is a close copy of the
.Fx
original, and first appeared in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Pp
Support for IPv6 and
.Tn IPcomp
protocols has been added in
.Nx 4.0 .
.Pp
Support for IPSEC_NAT_T
(Network Address Translator Traversal as
described in RFCs 3947 and 3948) has been added in
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh BUGS
There still are some issues in the IPv6 support.
In particular
.Tn FAST_IPSEC
does not protect packets with IPv6 extension headers.
.Pp
Certain legacy authentication algorithms are not supported because of
issues with the
.Xr opencrypto 9
subsystem.
.Pp
This documentation is incomplete.
