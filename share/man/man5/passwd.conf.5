.Sh NAME
.Nm passwd.conf
.Nd password encryption configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /etc/passwd.conf
file, consisting of
.Dq stanzas ,
describes the configuration of the password cipher used
to encrypt local or YP passwords.
.Pp
There are default, user and group specific stanzas.
If no user or group
stanza to a specific option is available, the default stanza
is used.
.Pp
To differentiate between user and group stanzas, groups are prefixed
with a single colon
.Pq Sq \&: .
.Pp
Some fields and their possible values that can appear in this file are:
.Bl -tag -width localcipher
.It Sy localcipher
The cipher to use for local passwords.
Possible values are:
.Dq old ,
.Dq newsalt,\*[Lt]rounds\*[Gt] ,
.Dq md5 ,
and
.Dq blowfish,\*[Lt]rounds\*[Gt] .
For
.Dq newsalt
the value of rounds is a 24-bit integer with a minimum of 7250 rounds.
For
.Dq blowfish
the value can be between 4 and 31.
It specifies the base 2 logarithm of the number of rounds.
.It Sy ypcipher
The cipher to use for YP passwords.
The possible values are the same as for localcipher.
.El
.Pp
To retrieve information from this file use
.Xr pw_getconf 3 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/passwd.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/passwd.conf
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Use MD5 as the local cipher and old-style DES as the YP cipher.
Use blowfish with 2^5 rounds for root:
.Bd -literal
 default:
      localcipher = md5
      ypcipher = old

 root:
      localcipher = blowfish,5
