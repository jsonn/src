.Sh NAME
.Nm nologin
.Nd file disallowing and containing reason for disallowing logins
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /etc/nologin ,
if it exists, causes the login procedure, used by programs such as
.Xr login 1 ,
to terminate.
The program may display the contents of
.Pa /etc/nologin
to the user before exiting.
.Pp
This file is a simple mechanism to temporarily prevent incoming logins.
As such,
the file
.Pa /etc/nologin
is created by
.Xr shutdown 8
five minutes before system shutdown,
or immediately if shutdown is in less than five minutes.
The file
.Pa /etc/nologin
is removed just before
.Xr shutdown 8
exits.
.Pp
To disable logins on a per-account basis,
see
.Xr nologin 8 .
.Pp
The file
.Pa /etc/nologin
has no affect on the login procedure for the root user.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/nologin -compact
.It Pa /etc/nologin
The
.Nm
file resides in
