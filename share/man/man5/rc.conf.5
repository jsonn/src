.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system startup configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies which services are enabled during system startup by
the startup scripts invoked by
.Pa /etc/rc
(see
.Xr rc 8 ) ,
and the shutdown scripts invoked by
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown .
The
.Nm
file is a shell script that is sourced by
.Xr rc 8 ,
meaning that
.Nm
must contain valid shell commands.
.Pp
Listed below are the standard
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values to which each may be set,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages.
Third party packages may test for additional variables.
.Pp
Most variables are one of two types: enabling variables or flags
variables.
Enabling variables, such as
.Sy inetd ,
are generally named after the program or the system they enable,
and are set to
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Flags variables, such as
.Sy inetd_flags
have the same name with "_flags" appended, and determine what
arguments are passed to the program if it is enabled.
.Pp
If a variable that
.Xr rc 8
expects to be set is not set, or the value is not one of the allowed
values, a warning will be printed.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
reads
.Pa /etc/defaults/rc.conf
(if it is readable)
to obtain default values for various variables, and the end-user
may override these by appending appropriate entries to the end of
.Nm .
.Pp
.Xr rc.d 8
scripts that use
.Ic load_rc_config
from
.Xr rc.subr 8
also support sourcing an optional end-user provided per-script override
file
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.d/ Ns Ar service ,
(where
.Ar service
is the contents of the
.Sy name
variable in the
.Xr rc.d 8
script).
This may contain variable overrides, including allowing the end-user
to override various
.Ic run_rc_command
.Xr rc.d 8
control variables, and thus changing the operation of the script
without requiring editing of the script.
.Ss Overall control
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy do_rcshutdown
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
If set to
.Sq NO ,
.Xr shutdown 8
will not run
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown .
.It Sy rcshutdown_rcorder_flags
A string.
Extra arguments to the
.Xr rcorder 8
run by
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown .
.It Sy rcshutdown_timeout
A number.
If non-blank, use this as the number of seconds to run a watchdog timer for
which will terminate
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown
if the timer expires before the shutdown script completes.
.It Sy rc_configured
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
If not set to
.Sq YES
then the system will drop into single-user mode during boot.
.It Sy rc_fast_and_loose
If set to a non-empty string,
each script in
.Pa /etc/rc.d
will be executed in the current shell rather than a sub shell.
This may be faster on slow machines that have an expensive
.Xr fork 2
operation.
.Bl -hang
.It Em Note :
Use this at your own risk!
A rogue command or script may inadvertently prevent boot to multiuser.
.El
.It Sy rc_rcorder_flags
A string.
Extra arguments to the
.Xr rcorder 8
run by
.Pa /etc/rc .
.El
.Ss Basic network configuration
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy defaultroute
A string.
Default IPv4 network route.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/mygate
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy defaultroute6
A string.
Default IPv6 network route.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/mygate6
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy domainname
A string.
.Tn NIS
(YP) domain of host.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/defaultdomain
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy force_down_interfaces
A space separated list of interface names.
These interfaces will be configured down when going from multiuser to singleuser
mode or on system shutdown.
.Pp
This is important for some stateful interfaces, for example PPP over ISDN
connections that cost money by connection time or PPPoE interfaces which
have no direct means of noticing
.Dq disconnect
events.
.Pp
All active
.Xr pppoe 4
and
.Xr ippp 4
interfaces will be automatically added to this list.
.It Sy hostname
A string.
Name of host.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/myname
(if it exists) are used.
.El
.Ss Boottime file-system and swap configuration
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy critical_filesystems_local
A string.
File systems mounted very early in the system boot before networking
services are available.
Usually
.Pa /var
is part of this, because it is needed by services such as
.Xr dhclient 8
which may be required to get the network operational.
.It Sy critical_filesystems_remote
A string.
File systems such as
.Pa /usr
that may require network services to be available to mount,
that must be available early in the system boot for general services to use.
.It Sy fsck_flags
A string.
A file system is checked with
.Xr fsck 8
during boot before mounting it.
This option may be used to override the default command-line options
passed to the
.Xr fsck 8
program.
.Pp
When set to
.Fl y ,
.Xr fsck 8
assumes yes as the answer to all operator questions during file system checks.
This might be important with hosts where the administrator does not have
access to the console and an unsuccessful shutdown must not make the host
unbootable even if the file system checks would fail in preen mode.
.It Sy no_swap
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Set the
.Sy no_swap
variable to
.Sq YES
if you have configured your system with no swap on purpose.
If not set to
.Sq YES ,
and no swap devices
are configured, the system will warn you.
.It Sy swapoff
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Remove block-type swap devices at shutdown time.
Useful if swapping onto RAIDframe devices.
.El
.Ss One-time actions to perform or programs to run on boot-up
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy accounting
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Enables process accounting with
.Xr accton 8 .

.It Sy lkm
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Pa /etc/rc.lkm .
.It Sy mixerctl
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .

.Xr mixerctl.conf 5
for how to set mixer values.
List in
.Sy mixerctl_mixers
the devices whose settings are to be saved at shutdown and
restored at start-up.
.It Sy newsyslog
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Run
.Nm newsyslog
to trim logfiles before syslogd starts.
Intended for laptop users.
Passes
.Sy newsyslog_flags .
.It Sy savecore
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs the
.Xr savecore 8
utility.
Passes
.Sy savecore_flags .
The directory where crash dumps are stored is specified by
.Sy savecore_dir .
The default setting is
.Dq Pa /var/crash .
.It Sy tpctl
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Run
.Xr tpctl 8
to calibrate touch panel device.
Passes
.Sy tpctl_flags .

.Pa /var/tmp/vi.recover .
See
.Fl r
option in
.Xr vi 1
for details.
.El
.Ss System security setting
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy securelevel
A number.
The system securelevel is set to the specified value early
in the boot process, before any external logins, or other programs
that run users job, are started.
If set to nothing, the default action is taken, as described in
.Xr init 8 ,
which contains definitive information about the system securelevel.
Note that setting
.Sy securelevel
to 0 in
.Nm
will actually result in the system booting with securelevel set to 1, as
.Xr init 8
will raise the level when
.Xr rc 8
completes.
.It Sy veriexec_strict
A number.
Controls the strict level of Veriexec.
Level 0 is learning mode, used when building the signatures file.
It will only output messages but will not enforce anything.
Level 1 will only prevent access to files with a fingerprint
mismatch. Level 2 will also deny writing to and removing of
monitored files, as well as enforce access type (as specified in
the signatures file). Level 3 will take a step further and prevent
access to files that are not monitored.
.It Sy veriexec_verbose
A number.
Controls the verbosity of Veriexec.
Recommended operation is at level 0, verbose output (mostly used when
building the signatures file) is at level 1.
Level 2 is for debugging only and should not be used.
.El
.Ss Networking startup
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy altqd
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
ALTQ configuration/monitoring daemon.
Passes
.Sy altqd_flags .
.It Sy auto_ifconfig
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Sets the
.Sy net_interfaces
variable (see below) to the output of
.Xr ifconfig 8
with the
.Dq Li -l
flag and suppresses warnings about interfaces in this list that
do not have an ifconfig file or variable.
.It Sy dhclient
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Set to
.Sq YES
to configure some or all network interfaces using
the DHCP client.
If you set
.Sy dhclient
to
.Sq YES ,
you must either have
.Pa /var
in
.Sy critical_filesystems_local ,
as part of
.Pa / ,
or direct the DHCP client to store the leases file on the root
file system by modifying the
.Sy dhclient_flags
variable.
You must not provide ifconfig information or ifaliases
information for any interface that is to be configured using the DHCP client.
Interface aliases can be set up in the DHCP client configuration
file if needed - see
.Xr dhclient.conf 5
for details.
.Pp
Passes
.Sy dhclient_flags
to the DHCP client.
See
.Xr dhclient 8
for complete documentation.
If you wish to configure all broadcast
network interfaces using the DHCP client, you can leave this blank.
To configure only specific interfaces, name the interfaces to be configured
on the command line.
.Pp
If you must run the DHCP client before mounting critical file systems,
then you should specify an alternate location for the DHCP client's lease
file in the
.Sy dhclient_flags
variable - for example, "-lf /tmp/dhclient.leases".
.It Sy flushroutes
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Flushes the route table on networking startup.
Useful when coming up to multiuser mode after going down to
single-user mode.
.It Sy ifaliases_*
A string.
List of
.Sq Em "address netmask"
pairs to configure additional network addresses for the given
configured interface
.Dq *
(e.g.
.Sy ifaliases_le0 ) .
If
.Em netmask
is
.Dq - ,
then use the default netmask for the interface.
.Pp
.Sy ifaliases_*
covers limited cases only and considered unrecommended.
We recommend using
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxN
with multiple lines instead.
.It Sy ifwatchd
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Monitor dynamic interfaces and perform actions upon address changes.
Passes
.Sy ifwatchd_flags .
.It Sy ip6mode
A string.
An IPv6 node can be a router
.Pq nodes that forward packet for others
or a host
.Pq nodes that do not forward .
A host can be autoconfigured
based on the information advertised by adjacent IPv6 routers.
By setting
.Sy ip6mode
to
.Dq Li router ,
.Dq Li host ,
or
.Dq Li autohost ,
you can configure your node as a router,
a non-autoconfigured host, or an autoconfigured host.
Invalid values will be ignored, and the node will be configured as
a non-autoconfigured host.
You may want to check
.Sy rtsol
and
.Sy rtsold
as well, if you set the variable to
.Dq Li autohost .
.It Sy ip6sitelocal
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
If you intend to use IPv6 site-local addresses in your site, set it to
.Sq YES .
Otherwise, reject routes will get installed on boot to avoid misconfiguration
relating to site-local addresses.
.It Sy ipfilter
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr ipf 8
to load in packet filter specifications from
.Pa /etc/ipf.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.
See
.Xr ipf.conf 5 .
.It Sy ipfs
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr ipfs 8
to save and restore information for ipnat and ipfilter state tables.
The information is stored in
.Pa /var/db/ipf/ipstate.ipf
and
.Pa /var/db/ipf/ipnat.ipf .
Passes
.Sy ipfs_flags .
.It Sy ipmon
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr ipmon 8
to read
.Xr ipf 8
packet log information and log it to a file or the system log.
Passes
.Sy ipmon_flags .
.It Sy ipmon_flags
A string.
Specifies arguments to supply to
.Xr ipmon 8 .
Defaults to
.Dq Li -ns .
A typical example would be
.Dq Fl nD Pa /var/log/ipflog
to have
.Xr ipmon 8
log directly to a file bypassing
.Xr syslogd 8 .
If the
.Dq -D
argument is used, remember to modify
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf
accordingly; for example:
.Bd -literal
/var/log/ipflog  640  10  100  *  Z  /var/run/ipmon.pid
.Ed
.It Sy ipnat
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .

.It Sy ipsec
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr setkey 8
to load in IPsec manual keys and policies from
.Pa /etc/ipsec.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.
.It Sy net_interfaces
A string.
The list of network interfaces to be configured at boot time.
For each interface "xxN", the system first looks for ifconfig
parameters in
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxN
and then in the variable
.Sy ifconfig_xxN .
The contents of the file or the variable are handed to ifconfig
after the interface name.
If
.Sy auto_ifconfig
is set to "NO" and neither the file nor the variable is found,
a warning is printed.
Refer to
.Xr ifconfig.if 5
for more details on
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxN .
.It Sy ntpdate
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr ntpdate 8
to set the system time from one of the hosts in
.Sy ntpdate_hosts .
If
.Sy ntpdate_hosts
is empty, it will attempt to find a list of hosts in
.Pa /etc/ntp.conf .
Passes
.Sy ntpdate_flags .
.It Sy ppp_peers
A string.
If
.Sy ppp_peers
is not empty, then
.Pa /etc/rc.d/ppp
will check each word in
.Sy ppp_peers
for a corresponding ppp configuration file in
.Pa /etc/ppp/peers
and will call
.Xr pppd 8
with the
.Dq call Sy peer

.Dl pseudo-device clockctl
compiled in, and that
.Pa /dev/clockctl
is present.
.It Sy postfix
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Starts
.Xr postfix 1
mail system.
.It Sy sendmail
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr sendmail 8
and passes
.Sy sendmail_flags .
The default setting for this calls on a function to determine if
sendmail is actually needed, which means the
.Xr rc.d 8
script that starts sendmail will check to see if
.Xr sendmail 8
needs to run in order to facilitate local mail delivery.
See
.Pa /etc/defaults/rc.conf ,
.Pa /etc/mailer.conf ,
and
.Xr mailer.conf 5
for more details.
.It Sy sendmail_suidroot
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .

some precmd checks accordingly.
If this is set to
.Sq YES ,
you can remove the submit.cf file, and then turn off the
.Sy smmsp
process.
Note that setting this to
.Sq YES
does not change or remove anything; you must still change the mode of
the sendmail binary and remove the submit.cf file manually.
.It Sy smmsp
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr sendmail 8
as a client queue runner and passes
.Sy smmsp_flags .
Note that the smmsp process is not a full-featured SMTP daemon.
Its main purpose is to flush locally collected mail from the queue, but
it can also be used as a non-privileged
.Dq nullclient
that forwards to a more functional SMTP gateway.
.It Sy sshd
