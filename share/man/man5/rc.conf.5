.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system startup configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies which services are enabled during system startup by
the startup script
.Pa /etc/rc .
The
.Nm
file is a shell script that is sourced by
.Pa /etc/rc
if it exists, meaning that
.Nm
must contain valid shell commands.
.Pp
Listed below are the
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values to which each may be set,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages.
.Pp
Most variables are one of two types: enabling variables or flags
variables.
Enabling variables, such as
.Sy inetd ,
are generally named after the program or the system they enable,
and are set to "YES" or "NO".
Flags variables, such as
.Sy inetd_flags
have the same name with "_flags" appended, and determine what
arguments are passed to the program if it is enabled.
.Pp
If a variable that
.Pa /etc/rc
expects to be set is not set, or the value is not one of the allowed
values, a warning will be printed.
.Pp
.Ss Basic network configuration:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy hostname
Name of host.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/myname
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy domainname
.Tn NIS
(YP) domain of host.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/defaultdomain
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy defaultroute
Default network route.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/mygate
(if it exists) are used.
.El
.Pp
.Ss Boottime file-system and swap configuration:
.Bl -tag -width critfs_require_network
.It Sy critical_filesystems
File systems mounted very early in the system boot, except for the
.Pa /usr
and
.Pa /var
file-systems.
.It Sy critfs_require_network
YES or NO.
Set the 
.Sy critfs_require_network
variable to YES if the network must be configured before critical filesystems
can be mounted.   This should be set to NO if you are using the DHCP client,
because the DHCP client needs to store its lease database in the
.Pa /var/db 
directory.
.It Sy no_swap
Set the
.Sy no_swap
variable to YES if you have configured your system with no swap on purpose.
If not set, or set to anything other than YES, and no swap devices
are configured, the system will warn you.
.El
.Pp
.Ss One-time actions to perform or programs to run on boot-up:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy lkm
YES or NO.
Runs
.Pa /etc/rc.lkm .
.It Sy savecore
YES or NO.
Runs the
.Xr savecore 8
utility.
Passes
.Sy savecore_flags .
.It Sy update_motd
YES or NO.
Updates the
.Nx
version string in the
.Pa /etc/motd
file to reflect the version of the running kernel.
See
.Xr motd 5 .
.It Sy dmesg
YES or NO.
Create
.Pa /var/run/dmesg.boot
from the output of
.Xr dmesg 8 .
Passes
.Sy dmesg_flags .
.It Sy accounting
YES or NO.
Enables process accounting with
.Xr accton 8 .
Requires
.Pa /var/account/acct
to exist.
.It Sy defcorename
A string.
This sets the default core name template, from which are derived core dump
files names. The template can include format charaters which are dynamically
interpreted. See
.Xr core 5
for details of the format.
If set to nothing, the default compiled-in value is keept (see
.Xr options 4 ,
.Xr sysctl 3
).
.El
.Pp
.Ss System security setting:
.Bl -tag -width securelevel
.It Sy securelevel
A number.  The system securelevel is set to the specified value early
in the boot process, before any external logins, or other programs
that run users job, are started.  If set to nothing, the default
action is taken, as described
.Xr init 8 ,
which contains definative information about the system securelevel.
.El
.Pp
.Ss Networking startup:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy ipfilter
YES or NO.
Runs
.Xr ipf 8
to load in packet filter specifications from
.Pa /etc/ipf.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.
See
.Xr ipf 5 .
.It Sy ipsec
YES or NO.
Runs
.Xr setkey 8
to load in IPsec manual keys and policies from
.Pa /etc/ipsec.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.
.It Sy auto_ifconfig
YES or NO.
Sets the
.Sy net_interfaces
variable (see below) to the output of
.Xr ifconfig 8
with the
.Ar -l
flag and suppresses warnings about interfaces in this list that
do not have an ifconfig file or variable.
.It Sy net_interfaces
The list of network interfaces to be configured at boot time.
For each interface "xxn", the system first looks for ifconfig
parameters in
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxn
and then in the variable
.Sy ifconfig_xxn .
The contents of the file or the variable are handed to ifconfig
after the interface name.
If
.Sy auto_ifconfig
is set to "NO" and neither the file nor the variable is found,
a warning is printed.
.It Sy ifaliases_*
List of
.Sq Ar "address netmask"
pairs to configure additional network addresses for the given
configured interface
.Dq *
(e.g.
.Sy ifaliases_le0 ) .
If
.Ar netmask
is
.Dq - ,
then use the default netmask for the interface.
.Pp
.Sy ifaliases_*
covers limited cases only and considered unrecommended.
We recommend using
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxN
with multiple lines instead.
.It Sy flushroutes
YES or NO.
Flushes the route table on networking startup.
Useful when coming up to multiuser mode after going down to
single-user mode.
.It Sy dhclient
YES or NO.
Set to YES to configure some or all network interfaces using
the DHCP client.   If you set
.Sy dhclient
to YES, you must either set 
.Sy critfs_require_network
to NO or direct the DHCP client to store the leases file on the root
filesystem by modifying the
.Sy dhclient_flags
variable.   You must not provide ifconfig information or ifaliases
information for any interface that is to be configured using the DHCP
client.   Interface aliases can be set up in the DHCP client configuration
file if needed - see
.Xr dhclient.conf 5
for details.
.It Sy dhclient_flags
Flags to pass to the DHCP client.   See
.Xr dhclient 8
for complete documentation.   If you wish to configure all broadcast
network interfaces using the DHCP client, you can leave this blank.
To configure only specific interfaces, name the interfaces to be configured
on the command line.
.Pp
If you must run the DHCP client before mounting critical filesystems,
then you should specify an alternate location for the DHCP client's lease
file in the
.Sy dhclient_flags
variable - for example, "-lf /tmp/dhclient.leases".

.It Sy ntpdate
YES or NO.
Runs
.Xr ntpdate 8
to set the system time from one of the hosts in
.Sy ntpdate_hosts .
If
.Sy ntpdate_hosts
is empty, it will attempt to find a list of hosts in
.Pa /etc/ntp.conf .
.It Sy ppp_peers
If
.Sy ppp_peers
is not empty, then
.Pa /etc/netstart
will check each word in
.Sy ppp_peers
for a coresponding ppp configuration file in
.Pa /etc/ppp/peers
and will call
.Xr pppd 8
with the
.Dq call Sy peer
option.
.It Sy ip6mode
An IPv6 node can be a router
.Pq nodes that forward packet for others
or host
.Pq nodes that do not forward .
A host can be autoconfigured
based on the information advertised by adjacent IPv6 router.
By setting
.Sy ip6mode
to
.Dq Li router ,
.Dq Li host ,
or
.Dq Li autohost ,
you can configure your node as a router,
a non-autoconfigured host, or an autoconfigured host.
Invalid values will be ignored, and the node will be configured as
a non-autoconfigured host.
You may want to check
.Sy rtsol
and
.Sy rtsold
as well, if you set the variable to
.Li autohost .
.It Sy rtsol
YES or NO.
Run
.Xr rtsol 8 ,
router solicitation command for IPv6 host.
On nomadic host like notebook computers, you may want to enable
.Sy rtsold
as well.

.Sy rtsol_flags .
This is only for autoconfigured IPv6 host, so set
.Sy ip6mode
to autohost if you use it.

.Xr inetd 8
daemon to start network server processes (as listed in
