.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system startup configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies which services are enabled during system startup by
the startup scripts invoked by
.Pa /etc/rc .
The
.Nm
file is a shell script that is sourced by
.Pa /etc/rc
if it exists, meaning that
.Nm
must contain valid shell commands.
.Pp
Listed below are the
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values to which each may be set,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages.
.Pp
Most variables are one of two types: enabling variables or flags
variables.
Enabling variables, such as
.Sy inetd ,
are generally named after the program or the system they enable,
and are set to
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Flags variables, such as
.Sy inetd_flags
have the same name with "_flags" appended, and determine what
arguments are passed to the program if it is enabled.
.Pp
If a variable that
.Pa /etc/rc
expects to be set is not set, or the value is not one of the allowed
values, a warning will be printed.
.Ss Overall control:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy rc_configured
If this is not set to
.Sq YES
then the system will drop into single-user mode during boot.
.It Sy do_rcshutdown
If set to
.Sq NO ,
.Xr shutdown 8
will not run
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown .
.El
.Ss Basic network configuration:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy hostname
Name of host.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/myname
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy domainname
.Tn NIS
(YP) domain of host.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/defaultdomain
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy defaultroute
Default network route.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/mygate
(if it exists) are used.
.El
.Ss Boottime file-system and swap configuration:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy critical_filesystems_beforenet
File systems mounted very early in the system boot before networking
services are available.
Usually
.Pa /var
is part of this, because it is needed by services such as
.Xr dhclient 8
which may be required to get the network operational.
.It Sy critical_filesystems
File systems such as
.Pa /usr
that may require network services to be available to mount,
that must be available early in the system boot for general services to use.
.It Sy no_swap
Set the
.Sy no_swap
variable to
.Sq YES
if you have configured your system with no swap on purpose.
If not set, or set to anything other than
.Sq YES ,
and no swap devices
are configured, the system will warn you.
.El
.Ss One-time actions to perform or programs to run on boot-up:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy lkm
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Pa /etc/rc.lkm .
.It Sy savecore
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs the
.Xr savecore 8
utility.
Passes
.Sy savecore_flags .
.It Sy clear_tmp
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Clear /tmp after reboot.
.It Sy update_motd
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Updates the
.Nx
version string in the
.Pa /etc/motd
file to reflect the version of the running kernel.
See
.Xr motd 5 .
.It Sy dmesg
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Create
.Pa /var/run/dmesg.boot
from the output of
.Xr dmesg 8 .
Passes
.Sy dmesg_flags .
.It Sy accounting
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Enables process accounting with
.Xr accton 8 .
Requires
.Pa /var/account/acct
to exist.
.El
.Ss System security setting:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy securelevel
A number.
The system securelevel is set to the specified value early
in the boot process, before any external logins, or other programs
that run users job, are started.
If set to nothing, the default action is taken, as described
.Xr init 8 ,
which contains definative information about the system securelevel.
.El
.Ss Networking startup:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy ipfilter
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr ipf 8
to load in packet filter specifications from
.Pa /etc/ipf.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.
See
.Xr ipf.conf 5 .
.It Sy ipnat
Runs
.Xr ipnat 8
to load in the IP network address translation (NAT) rules from
.Pa /etc/ipnat.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.
See
.Xr ipnat.conf 5 .
.It Sy ipfs
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr ipfs 8
to save and restore information for ipnat and ipfilter state tables.
The information is stored in
.Pa /var/db/ipf/ipstate.ipf
and
.Pa /var/db/ipf/ipnat.ipf .
Passes
.Sy ipfs_flags .
.It Sy ipsec
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr setkey 8
to load in IPsec manual keys and policies from
.Pa /etc/ipsec.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.
.It Sy ipmon
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr ipmon 8
to read
.Xr ipf 8
packet log information and log it to a file or the system log.
Passes
.Sy ipmon_flags .
.It Sy auto_ifconfig
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Sets the
.Sy net_interfaces
variable (see below) to the output of
.Xr ifconfig 8
with the
.Ar -l
flag and suppresses warnings about interfaces in this list that
do not have an ifconfig file or variable.
.It Sy net_interfaces
The list of network interfaces to be configured at boot time.
For each interface "xxN", the system first looks for ifconfig
parameters in
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxN
and then in the variable
.Sy ifconfig_xxN .
The contents of the file or the variable are handed to ifconfig
after the interface name.
If
.Sy auto_ifconfig
is set to "NO" and neither the file nor the variable is found,
a warning is printed.
Refer to
.Xr ifconfig.if 5
for more details on
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxN .
.It Sy ifaliases_*
List of
.Sq Ar "address netmask"
pairs to configure additional network addresses for the given
configured interface
.Dq *
(e.g.
.Sy ifaliases_le0 ) .
If
.Ar netmask
is
.Dq - ,
then use the default netmask for the interface.
.Pp
.Sy ifaliases_*
covers limited cases only and considered unrecommended.
We recommend using
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxN
with multiple lines instead.
.It Sy flushroutes
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Flushes the route table on networking startup.
Useful when coming up to multiuser mode after going down to
single-user mode.
.It Sy dhclient
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Set to
.Sq YES
to configure some or all network interfaces using
the DHCP client.
If you set
.Sy dhclient
to
.Sq YES ,
you must either have
.Pa /var
in
.Sy critical_filesystems_beforenet ,
as part of
.Pa / ,
or direct the DHCP client to store the leases file on the root
filesystem by modifying the
.Sy dhclient_flags
variable.
You must not provide ifconfig information or ifaliases
information for any interface that is to be configured using the DHCP client.
Interface aliases can be set up in the DHCP client configuration
file if needed - see
.Xr dhclient.conf 5
for details.
.Pp
Passes
.Sy dhclient_flags
to the DHCP client.
See
.Xr dhclient 8
for complete documentation.
If you wish to configure all broadcast
network interfaces using the DHCP client, you can leave this blank.
To configure only specific interfaces, name the interfaces to be configured
on the command line.
.Pp
If you must run the DHCP client before mounting critical filesystems,
then you should specify an alternate location for the DHCP client's lease
file in the
.Sy dhclient_flags
variable - for example, "-lf /tmp/dhclient.leases".
.It Sy ntpdate
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Runs
.Xr ntpdate 8
to set the system time from one of the hosts in
.Sy ntpdate_hosts .
If
.Sy ntpdate_hosts
is empty, it will attempt to find a list of hosts in
.Pa /etc/ntp.conf .
.It Sy ppp_peers
If
.Sy ppp_peers
is not empty, then
.Pa /etc/netstart
will check each word in
.Sy ppp_peers
for a coresponding ppp configuration file in
.Pa /etc/ppp/peers
and will call
.Xr pppd 8
with the
.Dq call Sy peer
option.
.It Sy ip6mode
An IPv6 node can be a router
.Pq nodes that forward packet for others
or host
.Pq nodes that do not forward .
A host can be autoconfigured
based on the information advertised by adjacent IPv6 router.
By setting
.Sy ip6mode
to
.Dq Li router ,
.Dq Li host ,
or
.Dq Li autohost ,
you can configure your node as a router,
a non-autoconfigured host, or an autoconfigured host.
Invalid values will be ignored, and the node will be configured as
a non-autoconfigured host.
You may want to check
.Sy rtsol
and
.Sy rtsold
as well, if you set the variable to
.Li autohost .
.It Sy rtsol
.Sq YES
or
.Sq NO .
Run
.Xr rtsol 8 ,
router solicitation command for IPv6 host.
On nomadic host like notebook computers, you may want to enable
.Sy rtsold
as well.
Passes
.Sy rtsol_flags .

.Sy ip6mode
to autohost if you use it.
