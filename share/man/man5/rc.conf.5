.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system startup configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies which services are enabled during system startup by
the startup script
.Pa /etc/rc .
The
.Nm
file is a shell script that is sourced by
.Pa /etc/rc
if it exists, meaning that
.Nm
must contain valid shell commands.
.Pp
Listed below are the
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values to which each may be set,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages.
.Pp
Most variables are one of two types: enabling variables or flags
variables.  Enabling variables, such as
.Sy inetd ,
are generally named after the program or the system they enable,
and are set to "YES" or "NO".  Flags variables, such as
.Sy inetd_flags
have the same name with "_flags" appended, and determine what
arguments are passed to the program if it is enabled.
.Pp
If a variable that
.Pa /etc/rc
expects to be set is not set, or the value is not one of the allowed
values, a warning will be printed.
.Pp
Basic network configuration:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy hostname
Name of host.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/myname
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy domainname
YP (NIS) domain of host.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/defaultdomain
(if it exists) are used.
.It Sy defaultroute
Default network route.
If empty or not set, then the contents of
.Pa /etc/mygate
(if it exists) are used.
.El
.Pp
Boottime file-system and swap configuration:
.Bl -tag -width critical_filesystems
.It Sy critical_filesystems
File systems mounted very early in the system boot, except for the
.Pa /usr
and
.Pa /var
file-systems.
.It Sy no_swap
Set the
.Sy no_swap
variable to YES if you have configured your system with no swap on
purpose.  If not set, or set to anything other than YES, and no
swap devices are configured, the system will warn you.
.El
.Pp
One-time actions to perform or programs to run on boot-up:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy lkm
YES or NO.  Runs
.Pa /etc/rc.lkm .
.It Sy savecore
YES or NO.  Runs the
.Xr savecore 8
utility.  Passes
.Sy savecore_flags .
.It Sy update_motd
YES or NO.  Updates the
.Nx
version string in the
.Pa /etc/motd
file to reflect the version of the running kernel.  See
.Xr motd 5 .
.El
.Pp
Networking startup:
.Bl -tag -width net_interfaces
.It Sy ipfilter
YES or NO.  Runs
.Xr ipf 8
to load in packet filter specifications from
.Pa /etc/ipf.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.  See
.Xr ipf 5 .
.It Sy auto_ifconfig
YES or NO.  Sets the
.Sy net_interfaces
variable (see below) to the output of
.Xr ifconfig 8
with the
.Ar -l
flag and suppresses warnings about interfaces in this list that
do not have an ifconfig file or variable.
.It Sy net_interfaces
The list of network interfaces to be configured at boot time.
For each interface "xxn", the system first looks for ifconfig
parameters in
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.xxn
and then in the variable
.Sy ifconfig_xxn .
The contents of the file or the variable are handed to ifconfig
after the interface name.  If
.Sy auto_ifconfig
is set to "NO" and neither the file nor the variable is found,
a warning is printed.
.It Sy ifaliases_*
List of
.Sq Ar "address netmask"
pairs to configure additional network addresses for the given
configured interface
.Dq *
(e.g.
.Sy ifaliases_le0 ) .
If
.Ar netmask
is
.Dq - ,
then use the default netmask for the interface.
.It Sy flushroutes
YES or NO.  Flushes the route table on networking startup.  Useful
when coming up to multiuser mode after going down to single-user
mode.
.It Sy ntpdate
YES or NO.  Runs
.Xr ntpdate 8
to set the system time from one of the hosts in
.Sy ntpdate_hosts .
If
.Sy ntpdate_hosts
is empty, it will attempt to find a list of hosts in
.Pa /etc/ntp.conf .
.It Sy ppp_peers
If
.Sy ppp_peers
is not empty, then
.Pa /etc/netstart
will check each word in
.Sy ppp_peers
for a coresponding ppp configuration file in
.Pa /etc/ppp/peers
and will call
.Xr pppd 8
with the
.Dq call Sy peer
option.
.El
.Pp
