.Sh NAME
.Nm login.conf
.Nd login class capability data base
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm login.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm login.conf
file describes the various attributes of login classes.
A login class determines what styles of authentication are available
as well as session resource limits and environment setup.
While designed primarily for the
.Xr login 1
program,
it is also used by other programs, e.g.,
.Xr rexecd 8 ,
which need to set up a user environment.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Refer to
.Xr getcap 3
for a description of the file layout.
All entries in the
.Nm login.conf
file are either boolean or use a `=' to separate the capability
from the value.
The types are described after the capability table.

.El
.Pp
The resource limit entries
.No ( Ns Va cputime , filesize , datasize , stacksize , coredumpsize ,
.Va memoryuse , memorylocked , maxproc ,
and
.Va openfiles )
actually specify both the maximum and current limits (see
.Xr getrlimit 2 ).
The current limit is the one normally used,
although the user is permitted to increase the current limit to the
maximum limit.
The maximum and current limits may be specified individually by appending
a
.Va \-max
or
.Va \-cur
to the capability name (e.g.,
.Va openfiles-max
and
.Va openfiles-cur Ns No ).
.Pp
.Nx
will never define capabilities which start with
.Li x-
or
.Li X- ,
these are reserved for external use (unless included through contributed
software).
.Pp
The argument types are defined as:
.Bl -tag -width programxx
.\"
.It file
Path name to a text file.
.\"
.It list
A comma separated list of values.
.\"
.It number
A number.  A leading
.Li 0x
implies the number is expressed in hexadecimal.
A leading
.Li 0
implies the number is expressed in octal.
Any other number is treated as decimal.
.\"
.It path
A space separated list of path names.
If a
.Li ~
is the first character in the path name, the
.Li ~
is expanded to the user's home directory.
.\"
.It program
A path name to program.
.\"
.It size
A
.Va number
which expresses a size in bytes.
It may have a trailing
.Li b
to multiply the value by 512, a
.Li k
to multiply the value by 1 K (1024), and a
.Li m
to multiply the value by 1 M (1048576).
.\"
.It time
A time in seconds.
A time may be expressed as a series of numbers
which are added together.
Each number may have a trailing character to
represent time units:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.\"
.It y
Indicates a number of 365 day years.
.\"
.It w
Indicates a number of 7 day weeks.
.\"
.It d
Indicates a number of 24 hour days.
.\"
.It h
Indicates a number of 60 minute hours.
.\"
.It m
Indicates a number of 60 second minutes.
.\"
.It s
Indicates a number of seconds.
.El
.Pp
For example, to indicate 1 and 1/2 hours, the following string
could be used:
.Li 1h30m .
.El
.\"
.Pp
The class to be used is normally determined by the
.Li class
field in the password file (see
.Xr passwd 5 ).
.Pp
The class is used to look up a corresponding entry in the
.Pa login.conf
file.
