.Sh NAME
.Nm lkm.conf
.Nd loadable kernel module configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies loadable kernel modules, see
.Xr lkm 4 ,
that are to be loaded a boot time.
The
.Nm
file is processed by
.Pa /etc/rc.lkm
at system boot time, if it exists.
.Pp
Each line of the file is of the form
.Dl path options entry postinstall output when
.Pp
Except for the
.Em path ,
all other fields can be "-" to indicate empty.
.Pp
The
.Em path
is either an absolute pathname, or the name of a file in
.Pa /lkm
or
.Pa /usr/lkm
that is the LKM to be loaded.
.Pp
The
.Em options
are some combination of the -d and -v options to
.Xr modload 8 .
.Pp
The
.Em entry
is the C symbol to call to initialize the module, defaulting to
.Fn xxxinit .
.Pp
The
.Em postinstall
script is run after the LKM is installed.
.Pp
The output of the
.Xr ld 1
command is stored in
.Em output .
.Pp
The
.Em when
field specifies at which time in the startup process the LKM is loaded.
There are three predefined values which correspond to three points in
the processing of the system startup script
.Pa /etc/rc :
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It BEFORENET
Before networking is started. This works only if the
.Pa /usr
file system can already be mounted at this time.
.It BEFOREMOUNT
Before all file systems listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab
are mounted (the
.Pa /usr
and
.Pa /var
file systems are already present).
.It AFTERMOUNT
After all file systems are mounted.
.El
.Pp
A "-" entry defaults to BEFORENET.
