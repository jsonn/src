.Sh NAME
.Nm weekly.conf
.Nd weekly maintenance configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies which of the standard
.Pa /etc/weekly
services are performed.  The
.Pa /etc/weekly
script is run, by default, every Saturday morning on a
.Nx
system.
.Pp
The variables described below can be set to
.Dq YES
or
.Dq NO
in the
.Pa /etc/weekly.conf
file.
The default settings are in the
.Pa /etc/defaults/weekly.conf
file.
(Note that you should never edit
.Pa /etc/defaults/weekly.conf
directly, as it is often replaced during system upgrades.)
.Bl -tag -width rebuild_locatedb
.It Sy rebuild_locatedb
This rebuilds the locate database,
.Pa /var/db/locate.database ,
which must also exist, in order to be rebuilt.
.It Sy rebuild_whatisdb
This rebuilds the whatis database(s).
Note that
.Nx
provides a default whatis.db for the system manual pages and
this may not be needed.
(Adjust your
.Pa /etc/man.conf
as necessary.
See
.Xr man.conf 5
for details.)
