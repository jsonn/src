.Sh NAME
.Nm edahdi
.Nd modify AHDI partition identifiers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm edahdi
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm edahdi
Allows you to modify the partition identifiers on a disk partitioned with
AHDI or an AHDI compatible formatter. An AHDI partition format is usually
only present on disks shared between
.Nx
and some other OS. The partition identifiers are used by
.Nx
as a guideline to emulate a disklabel on such a disk.
.Pp
.Nm edahdi
supports the following options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width device
.It Ar device
The name of the raw device you want to edit.
.El
.Pp
The following partition identifiers are recognized by
.Nx :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "GEM or BGM" -compact
.It NBD
Partition is reserved for
.Nx .
This can be either a root or an user partition. The first NBD
partition on a disk will be mapped to partition
.Em a
in
.Nx .
The following NBD partitions will be mapped from 
.Em d
up.
The filesystem type is ffs by default.
.It SWP
The first SWP partition is mapped to partition
.Em b.
.It GEM or BGM
These partitions are mapped from 
.Em d
up. The filesystem type is msdos.
.It NBR
.Nx
root partition (depricated).
.It NBU
.Nx
user partition (depricated).
.It NBS
.Nx
swap partition (depricated).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Say, you have a disk with that is partitioned like:
.Pp
.Bl -column header Number   Id
.Sy "Number   Id"
  1     GEM
  2     GEM
  3     GEM
  4     GEM
.El
.Pp
This partitioning will show up in
.Nx
as (Number refers to the first table):
.Pp
.Bl -column header "Partition        Fstype  Number"
.Sy "Partition        Fstype  Number"
 c (whole disk)  unused   
 d (user part)   MSDOS     1
 e (user part)   MSDOS     2
 f (user part)   MSDOS     3
 g (user part)   MSDOS     4
.El
.Pp
Now you decide to change the id of partition 2 and 3 to NBD. Now
.Nx
will show the partitioning as (Number refers to the first table):
.Pp
.Bl -column header "Partition        Fstype  Number"
.Sy "Partition        Fstype  Number"
 a (root)        4.2BSD    2
 c (whole disk)  unused
 d (user part)   MSDOS     1
 e (user part)   4.2BSD    3
 f (user part)   MSDOS     4
.El
.Pp
You will notice that the order of the partitions has changed! You will have
to watchout for this. It is a consequence of
.Nx
habit of assigning a predefined meaning to the partitions
.Em a/b
and
.Em c .
.Sh CAVEATS
The changes made to the AHDI partitions will become active on the next
.Em first open
of the device. You are advised to use
.Nm edahdi
only on a device without any mounted or otherwise active partitions. This
is not enforced by
.Nm edahdi.
This is particularly confusing when your change caused partitions to shift,
as shown in the example above.
.Pp
As soon as a disk contains at least one NBD partition, you are allowed to
write disklabels and install bootstraps.

.Xr disklabel 8
.Xr installboot 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm edahdi
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.2 .
