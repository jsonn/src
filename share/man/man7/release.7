.Sh NAME
.Nm release
.Nd layout of NetBSD releases and snapshots
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This document describes the layout of
.Nx
releases and snapshots.
This layout should be consistent between FTP servers and CD-ROMs,
except possibly the path that leads to the release hierarchy.
.Pp
In this document, the following special words have these definitions:
.Bl -tag -width "\*[Lt]machine_arch\*[Gt]"
.It Em \*[Lt]machine\*[Gt]
The platform for which the release was built, corresponding to the
.Em hw.machine
sysctl variable, e.g.
.Em i386
or
.Em amiga .
.It Em \*[Lt]machine_arch\*[Gt]
The architecture for which a particular installation set was built,
corresponding to the
.Em hw.machine_arch
sysctl variable, e.g.
.Em i386
or
.Em m68k .
.It Em \*[Lt]rel\*[Gt]
The target release.
.El
.Pp
All
.Sy README
files are descriptions of the various files in directories that have
.Dq non-standard
contents.
There may also be a
.Sy README
file at the top-level,
describing who built the snapshot and under what circumstances
.Po e.g. whether it's an official
.Nx
snapshot, or not
.Pc .
.Pp
All
.Sy BSDSUM
files are historic
.Bx
checksums for the various files in that directory,
in the format produced by the command:
.Sy cksum -o 1 \*[Lt]file\*[Gt] .
.Pp
All
.Sy CKSUM
files are POSIX checksums for the various files in that directory, in the
format produced by the command:
.Sy cksum \*[Lt]file\*[Gt] .
.Pp
All
.Sy MD5
files are MD5 digests for the various files in that directory, in the
format produced by the command:
.Sy cksum -m \*[Lt]file\*[Gt] .
.Pp
All
.Sy SYSVSUM
files are historic
.At V
checksums for the various files in
that directory, in the format produced by the command:
.Sy cksum -o 2 \*[Lt]file\*[Gt] .
.Pp
The MD5 digest is the safest checksum, followed by the POSIX checksum.
The other two checksums are provided only to ensure that the widest possible
range of system can check the integrity of the release files.
.Pp
Files that end in
.Sy .tgz
are gzipped tar archives.  This is used in lieu of
.Sy .tar.gz
because the software used to download the sets may incorrectly auto-unpack
files ending in
.Sy .gz
and to accommodate systems which only support 3 character extensions
to file names.
.Pp
All tar archives are relative to the target's
.Sy /
directory, and
.Em do not
include the leading
.Dq / .
.Pp
All compression of release files is to be performed with the command:
.Sy gzip -9 .
.Pp
The root of the release hierarchy may be the root directory of a
CD-ROM, but in all other cases it should be
.Sm off
.Xo
.Sy .../NetBSD-
.Em \*[Lt]rel\*[Gt]
.Sy / .
.Xc
.Sm on
.Pp
The root of the release hierarchy should contain the following
files and subdirectories:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "\*[Lt]machine\*[Gt]"
.
.It Sy SOURCE_DATE
A file containing the date, in UTC, of the source code from which the
release or snapshot was built, in the default format produced by the
command:
.Sy date -u .
.
.It Sy iso/
CDROM images in ISO 9660 format, usually created with
.Dq ./build.sh ... iso-image ...
after a
.Dq ./build.sh -x ... release ...
in
.Pa src
or created with
.Dq ./build.sh ... iso-image-source ...
after a
.Dq ./build.sh -x ... release sourcesets ...
in
.Pa src .
.Pp
Images in this directory, unlike images in the
.Sm off
.Xo
.Sy .../NetBSD-
.Em \*[Lt]rel\*[Gt]
.Sy /
.Em \*[Lt]machine\*[Gt]
.Sy /installation/cdrom/
.Xc
.Sm on
directory, should contain file systems that
have an internal layout that corresponds to
a complete release for one or more machine types.
If built with
.Dq iso-image-source ,
then it will also contain a
.Dq source
directory.
These images are usually bootable.
