user package variables
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the variables that users of the
.Nx
packages system can set to alter the configuration of the package system,
and individual packages.
.Sh COMMON VARIABLES
This section documents variables that typically apply to all packages.
Many of these may be set in
.Xr mk.conf 5 .
.Bl -tag -indent -width XXXXXXXXX

.Dq uname -m .
See
.Xr uname 1 .
.It OPSYS
The operating system name, as returned by 
.Dq uname -s .
.It LOCALBASE
Where non-X11 based packages will be installed.
The default is
.Pa /usr/pkg .
.It CROSSBASE
Where
.Dq cross
category packages will be installed.
The default is
.Pa ${LOCALBASE}/cross .
.It X11BASE
Where X11 is installed on the system, and where
.Dq X11
category packages will be installed.
The default is
.Pa /usr/X11R6 .
.It DISTDIR
Where to get gzip'd, tarballed copies of original sources.  The default is
.Pa ${PKGSRCDIR}/distfiles .

Backup location(s) for distribution files and patch files if not found
locally and ${MASTER_SITES}/${PATCH_SITES}.  The Defaults are
.Pa ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/distfiles/${DIST_SUBDIR}/
and
.Pa ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/distfiles/${DIST_SUBDIR}/ .
.It MASTER_SITE_OVERRIDE
If set, override the MASTER_SITES setting with this value.
.It PACKAGES
A top level directory where all packages go (rather than going locally
to each package).  The default is
.Pa ${PKGSRCDIR}/packages .
