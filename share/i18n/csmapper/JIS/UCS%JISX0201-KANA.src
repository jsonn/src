#	General notes:
#
#
# This table contains one set of mappings from JIS X 0201 into Unicode.
# Note that these data are *possible* mappings only and may not be the
# same as those used by actual products, nor may they be the best suited
# for all uses.  For more information on the mappings between various code
# pages incorporating the repertoire of JIS X 0201 and Unicode, consult the
# VENDORS mapping data.  Normative information on the mapping between
# JIS X 0201 and Unicode may be found in the Unihan.txt file in the
# latest Unicode Character Database.
#
# If you have carefully considered the fact that the mappings in
# this table are only one possible set of mappings between JIS X 0201 and
# Unicode and have no normative status, but still feel that you
# have located an error in the table that requires fixing, you may
# report any such error to errata@unicode.org.
#
#
#	Format:  Three tab-separated columns
#		Column #1 is the shift JIS code (in hex as 0xXX)
#		Column #2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX)
#		Column #3 the Unicode (ISO 10646) name (follows a comment sign)
#
#	The entries are in JIS order
